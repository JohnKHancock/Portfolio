The objective of the project is to extract, audit, clean, shape, and load data from the Open Street
Map project(osm) for the city of Detroit, MI into a MongoDB database instance. The project will achieve
that by exporting out the osm file for Detroit from the website (https://www.openstreetmap.org). Then,
audit the data, clean it, shape the data into a list of JSON objects and load it into an instance of
MongoDB. Finally, perform searches and other data analysis in MongoDB.
