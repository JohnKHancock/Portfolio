These take place by a soccer field, inside a now out-of-use milling facility, and in a gray room where Porumboiu and the man doing most of the talking, Laurentiu Ginghina, stand before a white board. The lighting is minimal, the conversation at ordinary pitch and volume, and the cinematic rhythm attentive but unhurried.Ginghina speaks of injuring his leg during a soccer match many years earlier, and how after several procedures he realized he would never play the game he loved at the level to which he had aspired. His accident, he says, was the result of “imposed rules, rules that weren’t the best.” Then, using the white board, he lays out an improved version of soccer (or football, as the rest of the world knows it). In his vision, the field has no corners and the teams work in subdivisions.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Following a scene in which Ginghina, at his office, offers not much help to a woman lodging a land-use complaint (the movie withholds the details of his bureaucratic job), he takes up the sports discussion again with Porumboiu at a gym, where a group of men rehearse some of Ginghina’s ideas, then at an apartment Ginghina shares with his father. There, Ginghina is compelled to wrestle with the viability of his ideas.Porumboiu (who in 2014 made the documentary “The Second Game,” about a soccer match refereed by his father) implies that Ginghina’s proposals would make the game something other than soccer. “Football 2.0,” Ginghina says. He reels off more versions in sequence, and Porumboiu interjects, “infinite football.”Robert Coover’s 1968 novel “The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.” depicted the world of a man who conducted an imaginary professional baseball season entirely through rolls of dice. Its thematic argument was that the only life is the life of the mind. “Infinite Football” has similar concerns but somewhat more of a metaphysical bent.While the movie has allegorical resonances with the political and human rights disasters of 20th-century Romania, by the end, its surfaces, while remaining superficially unimpressive, open up as the film moves from epistemological speculation onto a plane of mysticism. This relatively short film contains worlds."

It also left him owing a great deal of money to a fearsome loan shark (Danny Ross) who enjoys torturing defaulting debtors. With only a week to find the cash, Randal is in a serious bind — until, through his binoculars, he spies a vile gang boss (David Manuel) murder a crooked cop in an apartment across the way. Maybe there’s a solution to his predicament after all.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Cheerfully derivative yet doggedly entertaining, “Number 37” benefits from Dumisa’s slick execution and impressive acting by her small cast. Cooking up an elaborate blackmail plot from his wheelchair, Randal becomes a stationary puppet master, casually risking the lives of a dopey friend and his long-suffering girlfriend, Pam (a wonderful Monique Rockman), to carry it out. When things go pear-shaped, though, Dumisa stages the calamities in tense, bite-sized scenes viewed through Randal’s seesawing lenses, cleverly conveying the frustration of his immobility.Though locked on lives shaped by chronic poverty, this tough little movie avoids social commentary. Drawing richness from his grungy setting, the cinematographer Zenn van Zyl is the opposite of immobile, his camera sweeping the teeming courtyard between apartment buildings and sneaking through narrow hallways and stairwells. To save Pam’s life, Randal will eventually be forced to attempt to do the same."

Here, deeply damaged people are prone to exasperating decisions. Yet these characters are so strikingly realized that you can’t help but care for them. It’s a potent mixture of feelings, to be frustrated by someone’s actions and, at the same time, hope that he stays safe.While working at a landfill in rural New York, Joel (Alessandro Nivola) receives a phone call saying that Will (Eli Haley), his 10-year-old son who he has never seen, has been abandoned by Joel’s former wife. Joel, who is struggling with mental illness, takes in Will, who has health problems of his own. Soon there are serious questions about Joel’s competence and Will’s well-being.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 2, 2018No one here, including Julianne Nicholson as Joel’s girlfriend, Janeece, speaks when a gesture or expression would serve better. Several long, wordless stretches arise during the film, all of them thoughtful. Jaron Albertin, directing his first feature, cultivates tension in small moments and doesn’t force the drama.The script, by Albertin and the playwright Enda Walsh (whose screenplay for “Hunger,” with Steve McQueen, featured similar meaningful silences), captures the rough poetry of working-class days and nights. Nivola’s taciturn performance is mesmeric, while Haley delivers an affecting film debut. Both deftly embody lives that are often overlooked.A somewhat stronger plot may have made “Weightless” more taut, and perhaps more commercial. But the search for honest emotions, rather than a quest for constant action, takes precedence in nearly every scene. That admirable choice leads to a quietly aching film."

It swerves from goofy to ghastly so deftly and so often that you can’t always tell which is which.This is a familiar (and hardly unwelcome) paradox for fans of the Coens. Ever since “Blood Simple,” the brothers have tended to treat whimsy and fatalism as sides of the same coin. The jokes that the universe plays on hapless human creatures may be cruel, but they’re also funny, and the Coens are skilled and wily metaphysical pranksters. The hangings, shootings, scalpings and other grim ends awaiting the hapless cowboys, prospectors and wagon-train pioneers in this anthology of western tales are incidents of mortal slapstick. Death is a hilarious punch line until it happens to you.And sometimes even then. In the first episode — there are six in all, presented as if they were chapters in a handsomely illustrated old clothbound volume — the title character, played by a grinning Tim Blake Nelson, takes the prospect of his own demise in stride, as he does everyone else’s. There must be an afterlife, this cheerful killer surmises, since there are so many songs about it, one of which he sings as he ascends heavenward.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 6, 2018Known (among other nicknames) as the San Saba Songbird, Buster rides the dusty range strumming a black guitar, a Gene Autry with a murderous streak. His adventures — shootouts, bar fights and poker hands punctuated by musical numbers and bouts of genial, straight-to-camera philosophizing — set the tone for what follows.Some recent westerns like to delve into the political and ethical implications of the tradition, seeking to balance the demands of mythic resonance and historical authenticity. “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” is defiantly not one of those. The movie pays tribute to some classics of the studio era, and also blows raspberries in the direction of earnest contemporary oaters like “Hostiles,” “The Revenant,” “Meek’s Cutoff” and “The Hateful Eight.” Genre for the Coens is not a church or an archive; it’s a playroom.And yet it’s always a mistake to take their frivolity at face value. They are serious not in spite of their facetiousness but by means of it. Even as “Buster Scruggs” is more frolicsome than, say, “No Country for Old Men” or “Inside Llewyn Davis,” it’s also in its way as haunting as either of those films.ImageZoe Kazan portrays a young woman on the Oregon Trail.CreditNetflixAesthetic pleasure has always occupied a crucial place in the Coen universe. They take evident delight in the mechanics of screenwriting and filmmaking — flaunting their ingenious wordplay, profligate storytelling and nimble editing (under the pseudonym Roderick Jaynes) — and also ensure that art, both lofty and popular, is integral to the experience of their characters.Entertainment is poor compensation for the brute fact of mortality, but it’s what we have. And so Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan), a young woman on the Oregon Trail whose brother has died and whose own survival prospects are precarious, stops to giggle at the antics of a colony of prairie dogs. A crusty prospector (Tom Waits), digging for an elusive pocket of gold in a pristine mountain valley, sings a wistful ballad, as does a gentlemanly bounty killer (Brendan Gleeson) during a tense stagecoach ride.People tell stories and jokes and engage in mock-learned debates — not to arrive at any solutions but to pass the time between now and the grave. Eloquence, in Coen territory, is its own reward, even if it isn’t always appreciated. In “Meal Ticket,” the grimmest and cruelest of these yarns, a man without limbs, known as Hamilton, the Wingless Thrush (Harry Melling), is carted around by a grizzled impresario (Liam Neeson) and made to perform feats of elocution amid the mud and dust of remote frontier settlements.ImageSaul Rubinek, Tyne Daly and Chelcie Ross star in the movie’s last chapter, called “The Mortal Remains.”CreditNetflixThe texts he recites — including Shelley’s “Ozymandias,” the story of Cain and Abel, Shakespeare’s Sonnet 29, the Gettysburg Address — are perhaps included to deliver some sly commentary on brutality, mutability or the vanity of human ambition. They also seem like plausible staples of the popular literary canon in late-19th-century America. Which isn’t to say that masterworks of poetry and prose were necessarily held sacred then, any more than they are now. Hamilton’s fate can be taken as a parable of the vagaries of the cultural marketplace. Not to spoil anything, but “Meal Ticket” is basically “Inside Llewyn Davis” with a talented chicken in the Bob Dylan role.And “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” which will make its way to the Netflix streaming platform on Nov. 16 after a week in theaters, can be thought of as a Coen brothers concept album. It works just fine in sequence, but some tracks — the one with James Franco as a dumb bank robber, for instance — only need to be played once. Others invite a specific needle drop: Kazan’s expression of surprise when she receives a marriage proposal; her awkward conversations with Bill Heck; her utterly natural delivery of the word “apothegm”; Waits stealing eggs from an owl’s nest and then putting all but one of them back.The last chapter, called “The Mortal Remains,” is the deepest cut, the one that might send you back to the beginning, in search of hidden meanings and buried patterns. Five people on a stagecoach journey converse idly and argue heatedly. A wizened trapper (Chelcie Ross) contends that people are all the same, “like ferrets,” to which a proper lady (Tyne Daly) responds that people can be sorted into two kinds, “upright and sinning.” A Frenchman (Saul Rubinek) maintains that every individual is distinct, the unique product of history and temperament.Their journey ends not in violent death, as nearly all the other verses of this “Ballad” do, but with something stranger and chillier that casts its shadow on what came before. As if the morbid jokes were really existential riddles all along, and we were only laughing to drown out the terror."

Rowling-verse. As is often the case in a Rowling production, evil is ascendant, seeping through both human and magic realms like poison gas.Mostly, though, because Rowling builds worlds, what “Grindelwald” has is a great deal of story. The movie is chockablock with stuff: titular creatures (if not nearly enough), attractive people, scampering extras, eye-catching locations, tragic flashbacks, teary confessions and largely bloodless, spectacular violence. It’s an embarrassment of riches, and it’s suffocating.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 7, 2018This is the second movie in what promises (threatens!) to be an extended “Fantastic Beasts” franchise. (Rowling spun this series out of the “Harry Potter” cycle, so subfranchise might be more correct.) It centers on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a “magizoologist” who studies, rescues and nurses magical critters. Unlike Harry’s tale, though, Newt’s story opens with him already of age. The new movie picks up in New York in the mid-1920s, the end point of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” With its cloche hats, Model T’s, Art Deco flourishes and a Jazz Age vibe, it is a handsomely designed change of scenery from Potter World, one that’s mostly a story delivery system.[Read our review of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”]Not much has happened since the last movie; mostly, people and parts have been shifted in preparation for the next great narrative heave forward. Once again, Newt is scurrying about while nefarious doings unfold in separate story lines. One is dominated by Gellert Grindelwald (a perfectly unmemorable Johnny Depp), an evil wizard who looks like he’s been dipped in flour (and who last appeared in the more flattering form of Colin Farrell). Grindelwald is consolidating his power and has big plans. These have become more transparent as fascism has seeped into the story, totalitarianism’s threat increasingly giving dark meaning to all the violence and ugly phrases like “pure blood.”Rowling is a literary magpie and first-rate synthesizer, and her stated inspirations for the Harry Potter books range from classical mythology to Jane Austen. Traces of the Bible, Shakespeare, Tolkien and other Western-lit staples are sprinkled throughout that series and therefore this one, too. However intentional, they form part of a cultural database, which is as smart as it is appealing. (The influences flatter but don’t overwhelm readers, and offer different interpretive portals into the tale.) Given some of these influences, it’s no surprise that the series is touched by death; given the arc of history, it’s also no surprise that it has morphed into an apocalyptic war story.A bleak, violent end — and the intimation of a worldwide cataclysm — looms from the very first scene of “The Crimes of Grindelwald.” Directed by David Yates and written by Rowling, the movie opens with a fierce, visually chaotic prison break that springs Grindelwald and sets the angry mood. The bad times rush in along with the assorted villains bringing escalating violence. By the time Newt materializes with his magical suitcase, where he often keeps his roaring, scuttling menagerie (mostly, sometimes) contained, the movie already seems like a series finale. It’s so freighted with foreboding that even the would-be whimsy feels leaden.ImageZoë Kravitz and Johnny Depp. Ms. Kravitz plays Leta Lestrange, and Mr. Depp has taken over the role of Gellert Grindelwald, an evil wizard.CreditJaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.The darkness makes a startling contrast to the first movie, which mostly involved a lot of narrative place setting, including all the fun beastly introductions. Most of the characters are back, including Tina (Katherine Waterston), a law-and-order type called an Auror and Newt’s limp romantic foil. One of the disappointments of the “Fantastic Beasts” movies has been the casting, which has little of the wit and powerhouse talent that shored up the Harry Potter series. Redmayne can be a sensitive presence, but when he isn’t well directed his fluttering and darting looks quickly settle into ingratiating shtick. If Newt has any depth, a mewling, quivering Redmayne seems unlikely to tap it.That the contents of Newt’s suitcase are consistently more interesting than he is remains a problem, too. Rowling keeps trying to make him and the mysterious Credence (Ezra Miller) the narrative’s twinned center. Yet your attention keeps returning, almost longingly, to the movie’s funnier, more charming supporting players, notably Queenie (a delightful Alison Sudol) and Jacob (the equally appealing Dan Fogler). They don’t share Newt’s pedigree or Credence’s ominous threat; they’re side dishes. But they have the charming idiosyncrasies and human frailties of Rowling’s best creations, and they prove to be the ones you care most about.On the page, Rowling is a master storyteller, creating worlds so richly populated and densely textured that you can easily summon them up in your mind without ever having watched a single adaptation of her work. What occasionally trips her up is plot structure — the arrangement of all her attractive, whirling parts. Steve Kloves, who wrote all but one of the Harry Potter movies, was gifted at giving cinematic shape to Rowling’s increasingly long novels, with all their detours and savory details. Here, however, Rowling has surrendered to her maximalist tendencies and so cluttered up the story that you spend far too much time trying to untangle who did what to whom and why.Its pedigree and behind-the-scenes talent ensure that “The Crimes of Grindelwald” is scattered with minor pleasures, mostly ornamental — the brassy filigree that summons up old worlds, the stray elf that reminds you of adventures past. There’s also the Zouwu, a charming monster with a catlike face and a long body that whips around like a Chinese New Year dragon, upstaging everyone who shares the screen with it. Yet, by the time Rowling has gathered all her story lines together and a somnolent Zoë Kravitz, as the slinky Leta Lestrange, is guiding you through another digression, the movie has loosened its grip on you. That tightens only when the story tantalizingly shifts to Hogwarts, where Dumbledore, fond memories and the promise of better stories await."

In between, however, it delivers a fairly predictable, though still quite violent, action-horror hybrid about a small group of American soldiers behind enemy lines.The year is 1944, the Allies are about to land in Normandy, and our heroes must take out a critical Nazi radio-jamming tower. The tower has been built atop a church, which seems at first like a typically villainous attempt by the Germans to use a religious site as cover for a military outpost. But there may be more to it, as we soon discover.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Private Boyce (Jovan Adepo) of the United States Army is the film’s nervous, newbie protagonist, always eager to do the right thing but derided by fellow soldiers for not being tough enough. Together with the battle-hardened Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell) and the meager remnants of their unit, they sneak into the small French village where the tower is, and learn from a young woman (Mathilde Ollivier) that the occupying Germans regularly take unruly locals to the church for punishment.What kind of punishment? That’s perhaps best kept secret for now — after all, the film was produced by J.J. Abrams, who likes to think of his stories as “mystery boxes” — but let’s just say that there are unidentifiable carcasses strewn in the forest, shadowy characters kept behind closed doors and a Nazi doctor who seems eager for freshly executed bodies.The idea of merging a World War II adventure with supernatural elements is certainly nothing new; examples abound, from “Raiders of the Lost Ark” to “The Keep” to (sort of) the zombie thriller “Dead Snow.” At times “Overlord” recalls these movies, and it also seems to be aware that its ostensibly twisty premise is actually fairly predictable: The film doesn’t try to surprise us with narrative revelations so much as it tries to jolt us with gore.That results in a curiously undernourished story that at times feels like it’s setting up mysteries and subplots that never quite go anywhere. Nevertheless, as seen in the film’s terrifying opening and its gruesome climax, Avery deftly orchestrates some grisly, intense set pieces. He delivers on the thrills, even if the story leaves something to be desired."

There’s nothing new about the abbreviated history you find in “Outlaw King,” a monotonous slog through the life and brutally terrible times of Robert the Bruce (1274-1329), a Scottish noble who fought — and fought — the English. At least in old Hollywood, filmmakers would also try to entertain you amid the clashes and post-combat huddles, giving you something more to watch and ponder than this movie’s oceans of mud, truckloads of guts and misty, unconsidered nationalism.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018The whole thing is a letdown, especially given that the last time its star, Chris Pine, worked with the director David Mackenzie, it was on “Hell or High Water,” a neo-western written by Taylor Sheridan that had ideas and characters to go with its genre moves. Mackenzie is one of three writers credited on “Outlaw King”; it’s evident that its problems started on the page and were so deeply ingrained that he never found a way to direct his way around them. The overlong, battle-heavy two hours (the movie has been trimmed since its festival run) also suggest that he was too in love with playing general by proxy.The recurrent churn of soil, blood and bodies largely seems to be the point, even if the presence of Pine and a few other fine performers nods to the movie that might have been. Pine of course plays Robert and offers an excuse to watch “Outlaw King” whether he’s staring thoughtfully into the picturesque Scottish distance or expressing alarm, grief or determination. These modes indicate the limitations of the character, though Pine recurrently manages to dig deeper into Robert than the dialogue does. He puts flesh on the man by tapping into his humor, longing, dread and gentleness, qualities that convey the story’s most painful stakes better than any battle.ImageChris Pine as Robert the Bruce, the title character of “Outlaw King.”CreditDavid Eustace/NetflixAlarm, grief and determination also shape the story, its relative lulls (with family and friends) followed by organizing and spasms of violence and so on. It opens with Robert and the other Scottish nobles — once led by an unseen William Wallace — licking their wounds, having recently been routed by the English. The enemy invaders in turn are led by King Edward (the characteristically excellent Stephen Dillane), a ruler whose perpetual disdain for the rest of humanity periodically swerves into disgust. In other words, “Outlaw King” more or less picks up where Mel Gibson’s “Braveheart” left off; to that end, Wallace’s legend and one of his body parts put in appearances here.Robert and the other nobles make uneasy peace with Edward but are shortly pushed back into violent rebellion, which is where Mackenzie seems happiest to have them. There are periodic cutaways, including to Robert’s new English bride, Elizabeth (the appealing Florence Pugh), whom Edward marries off for diplomatic reasons. Pugh helps elevate this thin character, furnishing Elizabeth with enough of an inner life that you, like Robert, miss her whenever they separate. The attempts to invest Elizabeth with a little overly modern-sounding feminist resolve fall short, though, and are reminders that historical fiction rarely knows what to do with the little ladies left at home.Mackenzie does nice, tight work now and again, mostly in more intimate sequences, but too many scenes drag, and his fetishistization of violence proves numbing. In one, a gutted, dying man’s entrails spill to the ground; in another, screaming horses and men are impaled on spikes. It’s telling that while the story turns on nationalism, the movie feels untethered from life. It takes the Scottish desire for sovereignty for granted (also: the English are greedy and pathologically sadistic). Yet like many movies of this type, it never engages a simple yet profound question: Why would human beings, especially the lowliest, willingly die to be ruled by a king named Robert instead of one called Edward."

Raised on Nora Ephron and Jane Austen, she cuts her insufficiently amorous dates short and opines on the death of romance. But when Blake meets a woman who trades sex for gifts — a “sugar baby” — the column takes on new life. Through her new acquaintance, Blake is introduced to a wealthy author and investor, Ian (Timm Sharp), and then writes about the transactional relationship she starts with him.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018CreditCreditThe OrchardThe writer-director Carly Stone pulls off an impressive trick in her first feature by shooting a story about money on a low budget. Blake’s negotiations with wealth and power are communicated through simple choices in design. Stone finds a perfectly fitted summer dress that allows Blake to pass among the rich, but by contrasting her bare-bones dorm with the self-consciously minimalist style of Ian’s bachelor pad, Stone also elegantly shows the imbalance of power in their relationship.When the dialogue addresses Blake’s choices, the effect is like a needle scratch on one of Ian’s vintage records. Blake obsesses over her dynamic with Ian, imploring friends to reassure her that she is not a hooker. Stone never introduces a perspective that might push back at Blake’s disparaging attitude toward prostitution. So, unlike the sensibly romantic heroines Blake admires, she is never confronted by her own hypocrisies. Over time, even the soft lighting appears to wallow with her in sanctimony. Mirroring its green protagonist, “The New Romantic” presents an image of sophistication while playing with ideas that are out of its depth."

Vivienne’s day (and the movie) begins with a bleak health diagnosis that leaves her stunned. Over the next 24 hours, each encounter with unaware friends, family and colleagues collides uncomfortably with her internal need to process the news.Parker, whose piercing blue eyes are at once jarring and sad, is more convincing as an intensely guarded woman who keeps most people in her life at a comfortable distance, be it her suffocating (but well-meaning) mother, played by Jacqueline Bisset, or her drummer-with-benefits (Taylor Kinney). (Though there’s a sense that Constant doesn’t fully trust Parker, or even himself, as he relies a few too many times on fussy hand-held camera work and claustrophobic close-ups to convey Vivienne’s disorienting state of mind.)Sometimes Vivienne’s closed off nature feels unintentionally alienating — the rapper-turned-actor Common pops up as Vivienne’s longtime manager, but their banter lacks familiarity. Renée Zellweger (unlike Common, a rare occurrence on screens these days) appears in a single, all-too-brief scene as Tessa, a friend who long ago lost touch with Vivienne. A story line involving a brusque Lyft driver (Waleed Zuaiter) plays like convenient filler.It all adds up to a film aiming to be a moving character study (and an ostensible homage to Agnés Varda’s “Cléo From 5 to 7,” a far more vivid exploration of existentialism), but instead feels adrift."

Unadventurous to the point of humdrum, the story monitors the dating travails of two young Los Angeles couples with little to engage them except sex and socializing.At least the sex is safe, though no thanks to the men. Quarreling and mating in almost equal amounts, Hallie (Emma Roberts) and the commitment-phobic Owen (Michael Angarano) enjoy each other’s company but hardly seem a match made in heaven. After several years together, she would like to cohabit; he’d prefer to drift and dream. His goofily immature best friend, Matt (Patrick Gibson), though, has fallen hard for Hallie’s ultrahot cousin, Willa (Dree Hemingway). Considering he’s still living at home and sleeping in his little-boy bed, his chances of Willa’s reciprocation seem slim.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018A low-concept, low-bar romantic comedy whose conundrums are as familiar as love itself, “In a Relationship” has a smudged tenderness and almost nostalgic sweetness, as if we’re watching these characters painfully learn everything that we already know. Their vague gestures toward employment — dabbling in photography, editing bar mitzvah videos — lend the movie a relaxed aimlessness that takes sexual experimentation and emotional time-outs in stride.Expanding ideas and characters explored in his short 2015 mockumentary of the same name, Boyd creates a soft-serve millennial world of Ubers and pool parties and ill-advised cell-phone snooping. The upshot is a gentle, gossamer movie that, like its soundtrack, goes down easy and is almost instantly forgotten."

In “El Angel,” wanting is beside the point. Introducing himself, Carlitos (Lorenzo Ferro) explains that it was his destiny to be a thief. Luis Ortega’s 1970s-set crime feature is inspired by the real-life killer Carlos Robledo Puch, who has served more than 45 years in prison in Argentina.The movie opens with the willowy Carlitos, whose soft features and curls eventually earn him his nickname, breaking into a house, dancing in it and then stealing a motorcycle, which he tells his mother (Cecilia Roth) was a loan from a friend. (“People are always lending you things,” she remarks.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Soon a classmate, Ramón (Chino Darín), introduces him to his criminal parents. The foursome briefly have the makings of a successful ring, until it becomes clear that the impulsive, disloyal Carlitos, held out as a potential sexual partner for all three, takes far more pleasure in living dangerously.The decidedly modest achievement of “El Angel” is to put viewers in the shoes of a sociopath, a character for whom murder is so casual that he doesn’t even waste time to blink before shooting a truck driver or a security guard. Carlitos’s sole reason for living is moving from one transgression to the next.The same might be said of the movie, which superficially probes his amorality while exploiting it for slick thrills. (When Carlitos sets a car ablaze, Ortega drops “House of the Rising Sun” — one of several Scorsese-esque music cues.) “El Angel” seems expressly designed to offer no insight — only an invitation to gaze into a terrifying black hole."

Besides, Nat owes Richard, who has already fixed his car.Richard is older than Nat, and much of “The Long Dumb Road,” directed and co-written by Hannah Fidell (whose mother is Linda Greenhouse, the longtime Supreme Court writer for The New York Times) is a solid movie about the wisdom of the intervening years.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018CreditCreditUniversal PicturesThe sheltered, wide-eyed Nat, crossing the country with his Pentax K1000 camera, regards everyone as a potential artistic subject.

(That doesn’t stop him, of course, from dispensing nonstop life lessons to Nat.)The leads’ chemistry nearly redeems this shopworn setup, and the movie is at its best when it simply chills out with them. The overly broad detours are less successful: Only someone as naïve as Nat could think that Richard’s unannounced visit to an old flame might go well, and a thread involving Ron Livingston as a former hell-raising friend of Richard’s rapidly becomes cringeworthy.But the movie, which rallies in the end, is wise enough to know that not every problem can be solved in the duration of a trip."

Dickinson plays Jim, a working-class lad who moves to London and quickly falls in with a group of male escorts who cater to a very specific sort of patron. Calling themselves the Raconteurs, these young men know “your Goya from your Gogol, your Fritz Lang from your Fassbinder,” and specialize in sparkling postcoital conversation and intellectual debate with refined, wealthy, older male clients. Jim, who looks like he stepped out of a Caravaggio painting, fits right in.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Jim has a problem, however: He literally faints in the presence of great art. It’s a real psychological condition known as “Stendhal Syndrome,” whereby individuals experience rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and even unconsciousness after witnessing overwhelming beauty. Here, however, it’s treated more as a clever device to propel Jim into the paintings themselves, as he hallucinates himself and his friends posing for great artists.As one might guess, McLean is not looking to offer a realistic depiction of life as a prostitute. Rather, he seems interested in exploring how beauty has been used and exploited over the centuries. The film’s elegant compositions themselves are painterly, with the actors carefully posed; and the atmosphere is theatrical, with crisp line readings and sparsely populated frames. Those elements, plus a meandering story line, may not make for a particularly involving narrative experience. But it sure is nice to look at."

The titular pimp is Wednesday (Keke Palmer), who learned the trade from her now-dead father — not very well, apparently, as she’s now in the hole — and fancies herself a tough-talking player. Wednesday has two strategies for augmenting her bottom line, one of which is to coax the luscious Destiny (Vanessa Morgan), a pole-dancing prostitute, to join her stable of hardworking women. The other is to reluctantly allow her childhood friend and longtime love, Nikki (Haley Ramm), to do the same. At least she’s reluctant.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018Packed with skimpily-clothed women and on-the-nose musical choices, this lurid melodrama adds to Wednesday’s burdens with a junkie mother (an occasionally touching Aunjanue Ellis) and a murderous rival, Kenny (Edi Gathegi). Kenny has guns, gold-capped teeth and a vile tongue; he also has first dibs on Destiny. It’s hard out there for our pimp.Written and directed by Christine Crokos, “Pimp” is sleazy as all get-out. Rik Zang’s cinematography is fine in the skin shots, but his street scenes are flat and lifeless, giving us no sense of place or a world outside the purely transactional. The movie might leave you drained and disgusted, yet it also serves as a reminder that Palmer (whose last notable feature, “Akeelah and the Bee,” was 12 years ago) is an unusually intense talent who deserves a much better vehicle than this one."

Nurtured by parents who were professionals in creative fields, he enlisted his school pals to “staff” his increasingly elaborate meals, made in a style heavily influenced by the elegant minimalism of restaurants like New York’s Eleven Madison Park. His Los Angeles home eventually became a supper club attended by Hollywood insiders of some particular caliber or other. (In one scene of an evening’s serving, a patron has her dish delivered as she utters the immortal phrase “P.T. Anderson and Luke Perry were there.”)“Chef Flynn” is an engaging documentary about McGarry’s boy-to-man journey, which concludes as he prepares to open his own restaurant in Manhattan. (Our restaurant critic, Pete Wells, awarded his place, Gem, two stars over the summer, citing some reservations about the service.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 1, 2018The movie, directed by Cameron Yates, is really a dual portrait of Flynn and his mother, Meg McGarry, a filmmaker whose compulsion to chronicle her son’s progress is unstoppable. Much of the interaction between mother and son consists of variations of him saying, “I can’t believe you’re filming this,” and her responding, “How can I not film this?” As much as his mother has clearly been a tireless supporter, the viewer can’t help but cheer when Flynn pushes back at her.The personal dynamic dominates, and it’s interesting. But I would have liked to have seen more about McGarry in the context of changing food culture, particularly the emerging consensus that running a kitchen, no matter how high the pressure, can’t be an excuse for abusive behavior. The young man seems a relatively gentle soul in a world still learning to be less needlessly rough."

While ostensibly explaining how the Grinch got so Grinch-like, it also inclines the viewer to raise other questions. How did he score that mountaintop mansion? What’s with the elaborately twisted pipe organ? And why does such a miserable being have such an utterly nice dog?Said dog, Max, is the most charming character in this version, directed by Scott Mosier and Yarrow Cheney. The filmmakers keep the visuals merry and popping bright. Benedict Cumberbatch, voicing the Grinch, opts not to compete with Karloff at all, which is smart, and speaks in an American accent, sounding rather like Bill Hader, which is confusing. A tepid hip-hop song about the Grinch plays over the end credits. It’s by Tyler, the Creator, who only a few years ago was considered one of the saltiest (to put it mildly) voices in music. Here, his contribution is as toothless as the rest of the movie."

In the original Swedish movie of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” an inky monster covers a huge swath of Salander’s pale back, its teeth and long claws angling for a fight. In David Fincher’s Hollywood take, a kinetic, ferocious-looking dragon drapes over Salander’s left shoulder, its leathery wings dynamically folded and long tail winding down the side of her back.In the latest and emptiest Salander screen vehicle, “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” the dragon perches on Salander’s back, its wings fanned and mouth open, like a hungry baby bird. The dragon looks as if it paused in midflight to catch a worm or pose for a coat of arms. It’s as blankly ornamental as the rest of the movie, which stars Claire Foy as a preposterously jacked-up version of the renegade hacker. Salander is still typing furiously and retains a taste for black clothes and vengeance, but her running and gunning now suggest a Goth cosplaying James Bond.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 5, 2018It’s an insulting development for such an original character, who no matter how poorly translated on the page or on to the screen has managed to stir the imagination. As her best moments underscore, Salander isn’t memorable simply because of her hacking or her ability to take down a male assailant twice her size, but because she exists outside of familiar binary classification. An amalgam of gender stereotypes distilled into one rough yet slippery package, she isn’t fragile or ferocious, victim or predator, feminine or masculine. She’s both, which means she’s neither, one reason it has been hard for mainstream cinema (with its his or her boxes) to turn her into coherent cinematic brand.Here, that unclassifiable quality has been blunted and contained, and Salander made into another blandly tough chick. It’s a bad fit for the character and for Foy, though the fault is scarcely the actress’s. Foy is best known for the Netflix series “The Crown,” in which she plays the young Queen Elizabeth II, a role that allowed her to express her range with intricate subtlety. She’s cut loose since, going flamboyantly big as a psychiatric patient in Steven Soderbergh’s “Unsane.” For “Spider’s Web,” Foy has been tamped down again. This time, though, little nuance seeps through the mask she wears (or her vaguely accented English), for which the filmmakers deserve the blame.Just don’t take it out on Stieg Larsson, who originated the Millennium trilogy and died in 2004, the year before the first novel was published. The movie is based on the first of two follow-ups by David Lagercrantz, also titled (in English) “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” suggesting that this character is too lucrative to ever properly mature to womanhood. A few itsy-bitsy spiders pop up, and Salander spins a web for a very bad man in his own hidey hole, stringing him upside down in the name of, well, something (just don’t call it feminism). From then on, she takes turns playing pursuer or pursued in a tangled tale that brings together old loves, family horrors, state secrets and life on Earth.A wash of murky hues and murkier narrative developments, the movie was directed by Fede Alvarez, who shares script credit with Jay Basu and Steven Knight. Alvarez tries to pep things up with chases, near escapes, dramatic rescues, fetish wear and female nudity. But the whole thing is a bummer, at times risible, as when swarms of law-and-order types conveniently overlook a laughably visible surveillance camera. Joining Foy in her travails are Sverrir Gudnason as Mikael Blomkvist, Salander’s ally and former lover. Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Merchant and a badly used Vicky Krieps also drop by for abuse, though their exploitation pales compared with that endured by Salander enthusiasts."

The combination of nudity and anonymity has a jarring effect. That cognitive dissonance, along with Narcissister’s grab bag of props, prosthetics and costumes, which she layers on as if she were a Russian doll, lends her dance pieces a sinister air.Journalists have generally respected Narcissister’s desire to remain incognito, but her identity isn’t a Banksy-level secret. From watching “Narcissister Organ Player,” a documentary and performance film that she directed herself, for instance, it is easy to glean her real first and last names.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 1, 2018At the core of the movie are two paradoxes: How does an artist whose work relies at least partly on self-erasure direct a self-baring autobiography? And how does a performer who deals in the inexplicable go about making a documentary whose purpose, ostensibly, is to explain things?The contradictory goals of the film seem fitting, given the nature of Narcissister’s art, and she reconciles them well. Narcissister, who never appears on camera without a mask, addresses viewers primarily in a singsong voice-over. When showing us photographs of her earlier years, she puts a finger over one of her eyes. The idea that her younger self is visible, but never completely, also speaks to her eclectic heritage as the daughter of an African-American physicist and a Jewish emigrant from Morocco.Narcissister attributes her fixation on biological and sexual imagery — a 2013 profile in The New York Times cited a “reverse striptease” in which she pulled her clothes out of her orifices — to her mother, who suffered heart valve scarring as a result of rheumatic fever. (In one of the performances shown, Narcissister, dressed as a giant heart organ, bursts out of scenery that resembles a giant pair of breasts.) Her mother’s body was always very close to her consciousness, Narcisisster explains; therefore, she puts strives not to put physical limits on her own body.The performance pieces volley between hypnotic and kitschy (there’s footage of her in 2011 on “America’s Got Talent”), and interest in them is a prerequisite for a movie that, by design, pushes the boundaries of T.M.I. (although the home movie footage is quite tender). All the same, Narcissister’s background in stagecraft, movement and rhythm serves her well as a filmmaker: Far from a conventional autobiography, “Narcissister Organ Player” always offers something to catch your eye or ear."

It ended a little more than three weeks later in a Denver hotel ballroom with a bitter excoriation of the press and the political process.Between those two speeches, rumors about Hart’s extramarital escapades — in particular his association with a former model named Donna Rice — overshadowed his efforts to articulate a new agenda for the Democratic Party. The swift collapse of Hart’s candidacy (not including his short-lived, inconsequential attempt to revive it a few months later) is the subject of “The Front Runner,” Jason Reitman’s busy, bossy new film.A number of recent movies have taken a heroic view of the press, in particular the old-fashioned, printed-on-paper kind. “Spotlight” and “The Post,” for instance, depict journalists as tribunes of civic righteousness. “The Front Runner,” based on a book by Matt Bai, a former writer for The New York Times Magazine, takes a dimmer view of the fourth estate. It belongs to the accusatory tradition of “Ace in the Hole,” “Network” and “Absence of Malice,” movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering.ImageHugh Jackman portrays Gary Hart in “The Front Runner.”CreditSony PicturesHart himself, played with sober, dignified charisma and a saving flash of wit by Hugh Jackman, is presented onscreen much as he presented himself at the time: as a serious, cerebral politician uncomfortable with the kind of personal display a modern national campaign seems to demand.Handsome and thoughtful, the senator is a rugged intellectual, conversant in the minutiae of policy and the grand themes of literature. He lends a reporter his dog-eared copy of “War and Peace.” He scores a clean bull’s-eye at a county fair ax-throwing competition. He has his flaws, though. The question “The Front Runner” poses is whether those flaws, which have less to do with lust than with stubbornness and pride, should have cost the nation the chance of a Hart presidency. Following the argument of Bai’s book, Reitman, who wrote the screenplay with Bai and Jay Carson, depicts his hero as a man struggling to protect his privacy and that of his family against the predatory prurience of the news media.After a prologue set in 1984, when Hart made an unexpectedly strong primary run against Walter Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee (defeated by Ronald Reagan in a general-election landslide), the movie starts out as a brisk procedural full of nifty period details and lively, nose-to-the-grindstone performances. Political operatives and reporters smoke cigarettes, whisper into pay phones and drink scotch in bars outfitted with dark wood fixtures and deep-red banquettes. J.K. Simmons, a Reitman staple and a peerless character actor, pockets a handful of scenes as Bill Dixon, Hart’s campaign manager.Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion. But after a while, once we’ve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.The villain is Tom Fiedler (Steve Zissis), a Miami Herald reporter who is in every way Hart’s opposite: slovenly, craven, opportunistic, inarticulate. Fiedler follows up on the rumors about Rice (Sara Paxton) — who met Hart at a party on board a yacht called Monkey Business — and follows Rice herself from Florida to Washington, where Fiedler and his colleagues stake out the senator’s house. Fiedler’s cravenness is also contrasted to the ethical anguish of A.J. Parker (Mamoudou Athie), a Washington Post reporter who pursues the adultery story with reluctance and distaste. (Fiedler is a real person. Parker is a fictional composite, partly based on E.J. Dionne.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnNov. 1, 2018Hart’s frustration bubbles over at times — when he snaps at Parker that reporters should “follow me around”; when he confronts Herald reporters outside his Georgetown brownstone in the middle of the night; when he lashes out at the editor of The Herald during a policy forum in New York — but the real suffering is borne by his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga). She is the surest magnet for the audience’s sympathy, a woman compelled by her husband’s carelessness (at least) and the press’s insensitivity (at best) to play a role for which she has no appetite.Lee is also the film’s alibi. Her innocence authorizes its slippery and simplistic handling of complicated themes. A scene in which Ann Devroy, a co-worker of Parker’s (played by Ari Graynor) defends the idea of holding powerful men accountable for their private behavior functions like a “to be sure” paragraph in an op-ed column. Apart from Lee, the women in the movie are either naïve, like Rice, or treacherous, like Irene Kelly (Molly Ephraim), the (fictional) Hart staffer who sells out Rice. In this movie to be a politician’s wife is to be granted a share of tragic nobility. For a woman, to be anything else, above all a professional, is to live in a state of moral compromise.At various points men, including Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina) are heard to reminisce about the old days when journalists ignored the sex lives of politicians. This cozy, old-boy arrangement is not explicitly endorsed, but the logic of “The Front Runner” identifies it with the finest traditions of American democracy itself. Those traditions were undermined when Fiedler and his buddies “hid in the bushes” (in Hart’s words) to catch the senator in a compromising position, distracting the public from graver matters.That moment, according to the original subtitle of Bai’s book, was when “politics went tabloid.” But it is hard to square that notion with either the previous history of American campaigning — see the examples of Grover Cleveland and Nelson Rockefeller, among others — or subsequent events. The death of privacy in the digital age (a theme of Reitman’s similarly misbegotten “Men, Women & Children”) has little to do with newspapers, and politicians have long since learned to survive worse scandals than Hart’s.“The Front Runner” regards the spectacle of American democracy, which has often been messy, unfair and ridiculous, with high-minded disdain. The film excites our curiosity about Hart’s behavior and then declares it to be none of our business. It scolds rather than illuminates, and prefers the defense of power to the pursuit of truth. That may be its sole claim to relevance."

Letting the comedic dynamo Tiffany Haddish have her way with his new romantic comedy-drama “Nobody’s Fool” is a typically savvy move.Haddish worked with Perry on his television series “If Loving You Is Wrong.” Here, in this R-rated movie (a rarity for Perry), Haddish riffs and mugs with much less inhibition.

In the first 50 minutes, it saunters through about 30 minutes’ worth of plot. Danica is in an online relationship that Tanya finds so suspicious that she ropes in the real-life creators of the series “Catfish: The TV Show.” In the meantime, a sweet, sensitive coffee shop owner named Frank (Omari Hardwick) pines for Danica, while helping Tanya with employment and addiction recovery. Frank, alas, doesn’t have the qualities on Danica’s list for an ideal man; once she finds out he is an ex-con, she’s even less interested. Until their first kiss.If the movie’s looseness lets in an excess of dead air, “Nobody’s Fool” is still dotted with pleasures besides those Haddish brings. Chris Rock has a funny cameo in which he goes near-full Redd Foxx, while Mehcad Brooks enlivens the last quarter as a dream guy who turns out to be very much less than that. Whoopi Goldberg, as the sisters’ pot-growing mom, contributes some funny stoner humor. Nonjudgmental stoner humor, at that. This is the first Perry movie I’ve seen to eschew strident moralizing, and it is all the better for that."

There is the film, which is made by documentary cameramen, which is the story of the last day of the director’s life. And there is the film, which is made by the director, which has just broken down for lack of funds.” That’s a fair summation of what transpires, the kind of elevator pitch you can imagine Welles perfected while he was filming and trying to complete this opus over 15 difficult, often turbulent years in multiple locations on two continents.An opening crawl offers some of the baroque back story. Welles began shooting “The Other Side” in 1970, but for financial, legal and political reasons it remained unfinished when he died in 1985. He was already a god of cinema or a fallen idol (depending on who’s telling the tale) when he started it in Los Angeles with a crew that included the cinematographer Gary Graver, who stuck with Welles throughout. According to Josh Karp’s engaging book “Orson Welles’s Last Movie,” Welles wanted to begin the shoot in Tijuana, Mexico, but instead commenced production in his own house, a fitting liftoff for a film that is a checkered masterwork.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018“The Other Side” opens with a brief sequence consisting largely of black-and-white still and moving images — an overturned car, a young man on a motorcycle going nowhere, various familiar and less-so figures — while a sober-sounding, offscreen Peter Bogdanovich speaks about a filmmaker named J.J. Hannaford, called Jake. “He died many summers ago,” Bogdanovich says in a voice that sounds like a sigh. He is nominally referring to the leading character, memorably played by the director John Huston, Welles’s old friend. But it’s obvious that Bogdanovich is also speaking about Welles and already blurring the line — between fiction and nonfiction, the director and his protagonist — that will only grow more indistinguishable as the story unfolds.[Read our review of the documentary “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead,” about the making of this film.]As Bogdanovich continues, a shot of Hannaford fades out, supplanted by an image of the young Bogdanovich in a transition that puts one of the themes into visual terms. Welles takes on a lot in “The Other Side” — men, women, the decline of Hollywood, the persistence of vision, and the charms, torments and betrayals of close male friendships. “For years, I personally didn’t want this document shown,” Bogdanovich continues, as a lonely horn wails, “frankly, I didn’t like the way I came off in the piece. But I’m old enough now not to care anymore how my role in Jake’s life is interpreted.” That this seems unlikely is presumably the point.Then again, maybe not; it’s hard to know, exactly, because of the film’s sly ambiguity, which is part of its pleasure, and because Welles did not actually finish it. A handful of others did, including Bogdanovich and the producers Frank Marshall and Filip Jan Rymsza, who relied on memories, script notes and a postproduction team that included the editor Bob Murawski to put Welles’s presumed intentions into commercially acceptable shape. It’s an admirable undertaking, though what relation it bears to the project that Welles carried around in his head — and that he shot and edited for years, massaging it like sculptor’s clay — is a question that only a séance could answer.What we have is something of a seductive tease, a haunted film that at times entrances and delights and at times offends and embarrasses. Its most successful section takes place over a single day that ends in death. Shot in different film formats, it centers on Hannaford, a gruffly appealing macho director based partly on Hemingway. Hannaford, who enters dressed in safari-style clothing that suggests that filmmaking, perhaps life, is an exotic adventure or maybe a blood sport, has recently returned from Europe, where he’s been making a film, also titled “The Other Side of the Wind.”ImageHuston plays a film director (modeled after Hemingway) in Orson Welles’s last movie.CreditNetflixAs yet unfinished, this highly stylized movie within a movie is seen in fragments throughout — at a screening for a wary studio executive (Geoffrey Land as a Robert Evans type), at a birthday party for Hannaford and at a run-down drive-in. Dialogue-free and filled with strikingly derelict locations, Hannaford’s film follows a motorcycle guy (Bob Random) who chases — and is pursued — by a woman known as the Actress (Oja Kodar), a regal beauty with enviable posture and a derrière that, to judge from its prominence, Welles cherished. Kodar was his companion in his later years, and shares script credit on this film.Welles apparently wanted the movie within the movie to be a take on, or perhaps parody of, an art film; he intensely disliked Antonioni, for one. It’s unclear, though, if the vividly staged and shot results — with their chases, poses, negative space and sexploitation vibe (we’re a long way from Antonioni) — were supposed to be this silly and emptily decoratively. Welles may have thought Kodar a fascinating screen subject, but here she’s a stilted fetish object. For much of the movie within the movie, she prowls around in diaphanous caftans or little or nothing, only occasionally dropping her mask to reveal something beguiling and human.Beguiling and human describe the rest of “The Other Side,” which is often as visually expressive and narratively engrossing as the faux art film is visually florid yet stultifying. Stuffed with old Welles friends and colleagues — including Mercedes McCambridge, Edmond O’Brien and Paul Stewart — this part of the story takes off with Hannaford on a set where he’s been filming some kind of comical-looking cine-smut with toys and naked women. He then makes his way to a party that is being given by a famous actress (Lilli Palmer in place of Marlene Dietrich), amid a scrum of sycophants, auteurs, cinephiles and whirring cameras.In time, a vision of a film artist worn down by life — or fame or disappointment — emerges, though it would be a mistake to assume that Welles was making a self-portrait. His traces are scattered throughout, inviting you to chase bread crumbs here or there. But nothing is obvious in “The Other Side of the Wind,” including how Welles places people in the frame, his brilliant use of dialogue — which overlaps but also suggests that people are incapable of speaking to one another — or the delicacy with which he directs his actors, his friends and his loves. If there’s a self-portrait, it’s the one reflected in all those beautiful, ragged, immortal faces."

And he hasn’t: what he has made is a deeply distressing, authentically moving psychological study of unswerving obsession.Anchored by Rosamund Pike’s powerhouse lead performance, this restive, raw movie slowly accumulates the heft to render its flaws irrelevant. Covering 2001 until Colvin’s death in Syria in 2012, Arash Amel’s occasionally bumpy storytelling (based on a 2012 Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner) jumps uneasily from one war zone to another. Facts are fuzzy, the rubble and bodies and wailing women blurring together until you realize that’s the point: locations change, but armed conflict is always the same in the innocents it claims and the suffering it causes. To Colvin — whether half-blinded by shrapnel in Sri Lanka or uncovering a mass grave in Iraq — that suffering was always the story.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018Brief hiatuses in London, where she worked for The Sunday Times, reveal the detritus of her personal life and the mental and physical toll of her work. Sucking on cigarettes and bedeviled by panic attacks, she’s more comfortable sporting blackened fingernails on the battlefield than pearls at her own award ceremony. Yet this is no neutered paragon, but a healthily sexual woman who wears designer bras beneath her androgynous work shirts.Afraid both of dying young and of growing old, Colvin addictively courts a chaos that the cinematographer, Robert Richardson, renders so vividly he seems keen to give us all a little of her PTSD. The real Colvin would have probably approved."

The Swedish playwright, theater director and filmmaker, who died in 2007, remains one of the most praised and, to a certain extent, most misunderstood 20th-century artists. The praise stems from his cinematic mastery and treatment of profound themes; the misunderstanding, from the conventional wisdom that because Bergman treated profound themes, his work must be a slog.But Bergman was a gripping storyteller. You could even call him an entertainer. The German director Margarethe Von Trotta makes that clear in the opening of her new documentary, “Searching for Ingmar Bergman,” in which she breaks down the opening scene of Bergman’s 1957 classic “The Seventh Seal.” This picture, she says, both engrossed her as a viewer and made her want to be a filmmaker. Her analysis reveals the formal elements that make the oft-parodied “Seal” so potent.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018Von Trotta’s search takes her all over Europe, where she interviews collaborators, critics, admirers and members of Bergman’s family, including his son Daniel Bergman (himself a film director). Upending the notion of his father as a snob, he notes that the American prime-time soaps were a key influence on Bergman’s own made-for-television drama “Scenes From a Marriage.”Because Bergman’s auteur status is frequently coded as patriarchal, seeing him and his work though the lens of a female filmmaker is salutary. Many of Von Trotta’s interviewees, including Liv Ullmann, who acted in many Bergman films and had a child with him, wax rhapsodic over Bergman’s way with actresses and female characters.Enthusing over an effect Bergman used in his great 1983 “Fanny and Alexander,” the director Olivier Assayas concludes, “Art defines truth.” Just about every minute of this movie shows how that’s true."

The director, Tom Volf, allows several arias to play in full, so that it’s possible to hear the astonishing sustained quality of her voice and to see, in performances of Bizet and Bellini, among others, what we are repeatedly told — that she was also a good actress.The documentary runs, chronologically, through career highlights, including a ridiculed 1958 performance of “Norma” that was canceled after one act (Callas had bronchitis) to her eyebrow-raising more-than-friendship with Aristotle Onassis, which began when both were married to others and ended, for a while anyway, after she learned, apparently from news reports, that he was marrying Jackie Kennedy.The movie is to Callas what last year’s “Jane” was to Jane Goodall: A documentary that revitalizes history through primary sources, to illuminating, at times enthralling effect."

Kid Twist, a 10-year veteran of the battle rap scene) follows Adam (Calum Worthy), a gawky grad student and a paperwhite audience surrogate. Researching rap’s use of the N-word, Adam is entranced by the vim and creativity of the performers and their utter lack of linguistic inhibition. But when he discovers his own talent for the form, his enthusiasm and naïveté threaten not just his relationship with his uptight girlfriend and culturally sensitive cohort, but his academic future to boot.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018Sweaty and swift, “Bodied” is the third feature from the South Korean director Joseph Kahn, who understands that a movie about words also has to gladden the eyes. To that end, Matt Wise’s camera ricochets among the actors — including the magnificent Shoniqua Shandai as a mouthy force of nature who owns every man she battles — and slams from one scene to another with unruly energy. Quieter moments, especially in the sensitively drawn connection between Adam and his rap mentor (a terrific Jackie Long), allow the movie to explore the complexity of cultural interaction with more subtlety than we’ve come to expect from our modern comedies.Though losing some momentum in the middle, “Bodied” mostly maintains an irresistible, deliriously offensive roll, jabbing sharply at racism and misogyny with rhymes that spark and fizz. The very opposite of a niche movie, it insists that only when we retreat to tribes do we risk belonging nowhere at all."

We do not know yet who the patient is; the answer to that question will turn out to be heartbreaking.“The Grief of Others” had its festival premiere in 2015, but is only receiving a domestic theatrical release now, perhaps in an effort to piggyback on potential buzz around Wang’s most recent film, the ambitious “A Bread Factory.” And as anybody who has seen that picture can attest, the director doesn’t go for low-hanging emotional fruit.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018Here, working from a novel by Leah Hager Cohen, he is not interested in melodrama so much as in the curious absence of it, as he explores the unlikely ways that grief manifests itself in a family that is coming apart at the seams. Ricky Ryrie (Wendy Moniz) and her husband John (Trevor St. John) barely seem to talk to one another, while their young daughter Biscuit (Oona Laurence) appears to be indulging in self-destructive behavior and their adolescent son Paul (Jeremy Shinder) has closed himself off.Into this low boiling chaos walks Jess (Sonya Harum), John’s pregnant teenage daughter from a previous relationship, who seems to have a complicated history with the Ryries but is invited to stay with them during her pregnancy. Early on, Jess befriends Gordie (Mike Faist), a young man who is also dealing with loss; his home is still filled with piles of his recently deceased father’s stuff, including a series of handmade dioramas built out of assorted junk.Those eclectic dioramas serve as a playful aesthetic reference point for Wang’s film, which mixes styles and modes. Though we are watching what often appear to be unnervingly even-keeled characters, sometimes we’ll glimpse a painful flashback, or hear a person’s true thoughts. In one marvelous instance, the family gathers in their kitchen, and then, as they leave the room, a part of the frame opens up to reveal the scene’s touching conclusion elsewhere.As with the director’s other works, there’s a self-conscious, constructed quality to “The Grief of Others,” but it rarely veers into the precious or the phony. It’s an artful portrait of a world that refuses the order we try to impose on it when we close ourselves off to heartache, doubt and pain."

But mostly it serves as a warm-up for “The Other Side of the Wind,” which Welles started shooting in 1970 but is just now being released — 33 years after his death.“The Other Side of the Wind” has often served either to burnish Welles’s legendary status or to further establish what dreary minds like to call his unfulfilled promise. By the time he began production on it, he had long ago written himself into history, having triumphed in theater, radio and film. His movie output was relatively modest compared with some of his peers, including those who worked in a Hollywood system and culture that remained hostile to him to the end. But the number of great films with his name on them is estimable, with “Citizen Kane” just the start of a run that includes “Touch of Evil” and “Chimes at Midnight.”Directed by Morgan Neville, “They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead” takes its title from a line that Peter Bogdanovich said Welles delivered a few years before he died. Bogdanovich — an admirer turned friend, supplicant and apparent rival — has for decades been among the most ardent keepers of the Wellesian flame. He’s one of the documentary’s more complex participants. He’s also been instrumental in the release of “The Other Side of the Wind.” His prominence here is understandable, although it complicates a movie that can seem less interested in Welles as an artist than in ideas about him (genius, failure, father, god, monster) that formed in the minds of others, among them some who worked on “The Other Side.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018[Read our review of “The Other Side of the Wind.”]The story of the making of “The Other Side” has been told before, including by the film historian Joseph McBride, who’s in that movie and the documentary. Like some of the documentary’s other participants, McBride isn’t immediately identified. Perhaps because of the large number of contributors or in an effort to make the film more commercially palatable, Neville uses onscreen identifiers fairly sparingly. This approach works best with the likes of Dennis Hopper, who first pops up unnamed during a bit on New Hollywood. Only later, do you learn that the clip of him is for a scene that Welles shot for “The Other Side,” which is, in part, the story of New and Old Hollywood and of two very different directors who represent each.Neville was inspired by Josh Karp’s engrossing book “Orson Welles’s Last Movie,” which goes into greater detail than Neville can in 98 minutes. Karp also pays closer attention to Welles’s artistic process, which in the documentary can seem little more than pure chaos. Yet one of the most engrossing interludes shows Welles guiding Norman Foster through a scene in “The Other Side.” “Relax your face,” Welles says. “Sad. Empty. Empty. Now say ‘Many happy returns’ so I hardly hear you.” Foster does, and Welles says, “You pronounced it too carefully.” So Foster, who’s playing an alcoholic, repeats the line, this time with a slight, perfect slur.It’s a wonderful peek at Welles at work, though it is soon submerged in the flood of images and voices that are neatly arranged to deliver the same idea over and over again. Basically: Welles was a genius, nobody knew what was going on in “The Other Side” except Welles (maybe!), but, then again, he was a genius. Instead of exploring or deconstructing said genius, Neville seems interested in putting it into tidy boxes. After the scene of Welles directing Foster, Neville cuts to a 1976 headline (“Will Welles Finish His Film?”) for an article by Charles Higham, an antagonistic Welles chronicler whom the director apparently despised.Higham’s article joins a persistent refrain in the documentary that suggests Welles, his radical independence and the very idea of film as art remain contested, confusing terrain. “Was it some sort of endless odyssey, we’ll never know,” one man shrugs. “It was this circus of scattered souls,” says someone else. “He seemed to be doing everything he could to alienate as many people as possible,” says another. Throughout, Neville seems intent on trying to read the man through his films, an approach that Bogdanovich says Welles would have hated. For his part, Welles, whose image flickers throughout — as the beautiful young man he was and as characters like Kane, Othello, Hank Quinlan and Falstaff — remains both elusive and indelibly present."

A screenplay pitch might outline an ostensibly unstoppable concept, or, the thinking went, one that was execution-dependent: It would yield big returns only in a well-made film. This is a risible notion because pretty much all art is execution-dependent, despite the exceptional returns that some of the shoddiest pictures can yield.The phrase sprang to my mind while I was watching “9 Fingers” because this French movie kept checking off a lot of my personal-taste boxes while never quite satisfying me. Shot in black and white (and even on genuine celluloid film), “9 Fingers,” written and directed by F. J. Ossang, relates its narrative without much back story or conventional connective tissue.The film begins with a man on the run, dashing through a tunnel as car headlights pursue him. He jumps over a railing and into wet sand, then finds a dying man who hands him a package. The people behind those headlights catch up, capture him, drive him to a grand but ramshackle manor and make him part of their gang.The man, Magloire (Paul Hamy) gets to know his semi-captors, and particularly one of the women of the house, the enigmatic Drella (Lisa Hartmann). He hears of the fearsome criminal boss 9 Fingers, and is left behind as the fellows go on a daring caper.

It’s often flat and tame, and obvious in the wrong ways: An addled gang member, Kurtz, charts a course to “Nowhereland,” for instance. But “9 Fingers” did hold my attention throughout because I was always hoping to like it more."

That appears to the case with Kailash Satyarthi, an activist in India who was one of two Nobel Peace Prize winners in 2014 and has devoted his career to rescuing children working as factory slaves. He is the focus of “The Price of Free,” a routine awareness documentary.It is difficult to argue with the premises that child labor is wrong; that everyone deserves an education; and that persons who risk their lives to rescue trafficked children — as we see Satyarthi and others in his organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, doing in the film — are selfless and worthy of the world’s attention. But because of this, watching “The Price of Free” is largely a process of nodding in agreement.The director, Derek Doneen, adds a bit of striking animation for flashbacks, and there are a few strands that generate tension. A village head arrives at Satyarthi’s ashram to retrieve rescued children, ostensibly to return them to their homes; Satyarthi is duly skeptical. And the film focuses with particular intensity — with the help of clandestinely shot footage — on the search for one boy named Sonu.Mostly, however, “The Price of Free” is interested in spreading the word about Satyarthi’s work, both in India and globally, and in getting consumers to approach what they buy with a critical eye, so as not to support child labor. That’s an important message, and it’s not essential to watch the movie to receive it."

And although it’s loaded with sex, the most brazen thing about “Marfa Girl 2” might be that it presupposes some knowledge of “Marfa Girl,” which played the Rome Film Festival in 2012, received limited theatrical distribution in 2015 and made little impact with critics or audiences. Even stranger: Clark actually includes scenes from the earlier film in this one, though they only add minimal context.Like the previous movie, “Marfa Girl 2” follows the lives of some young, down-and-out characters in the dusty town of Marfa, Texas. Chief among them is the skater Adam (Adam Mediano), who has two children from two different women, and Marfa Girl (Drake Burnette), who herself is now saddled with an infant, the result of a brutal rape that occurred in the earlier movie.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018Clark’s characters ease into intimacy and sex, and there’s an unhurried, improvisatory simplicity to their interactions. But they wrestle with the responsibilities of parenting: Adam can’t be bothered, and Marfa Girl suffers from trauma and postpartum depression. There’s no judgment here. Clark likes to linger on close-ups of intertwined naked bodies, and he seems to admire these characters’ freedom. But ultimately, it all feels whisper thin: The film, already quite short, doesn’t offer enough about any of these people for us to care genuinely about what happens to them."

Said to be intended as a reflection on shifts in Turkish history and identity, it is too diffuse and withholding to add up to a cogent result.Mizrahi has cited the influence of the Portuguese director Pedro Costa, who in a trilogy of films shot in the Lisbon slum of Fontainhas allowed residents to shape their dialogue and scenes. Mizrahi, taking her cues from her subjects, has appropriated Costa’s style pretty faithfully. For the location, she has selected a retirement home and an adjacent construction site in the Istanbul neighborhood where her father grew up.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018The home’s residents include a photographer who fusses with his old Nikon but can no longer see, and a dirty old man (there’s no other phrase for it) who shares recollections of sex parties and, late in the film, tentatively proposes marriage to the offscreen filmmaker, who did her own camera and sound work.Most interestingly, a centenarian woman who asks to be identified only as Selma shares memories of surviving the Armenian genocide. Her family took on Turkish names and was forced to convert to Islam. At one point she nods off on camera; Mizrahi cuts to her waking up and apologizing — an inclusion that seems partly humorous and partly cruel.A case can be made for the sterile beauty of the home’s shadowy bedrooms and of the snowfall outside. “Distant Constellation” maintains an unadorned purity at the expense of quite a bit else."

Perky and informative, this gabby, gossipy documentary from Dana Adam Shapiro follows the founding and stratospheric rise of the original spangled squad and the controversies it kicked up with those famous white boots.The movie’s central dispute, though — were the women symbols of liberation or victims of exploitation? — remains unsettled, probably because the two options aren’t mutually exclusive. If Super Bowl X in 1976 made them lucrative TV-camera candy — especially the close-ups known as “honey shots” — they were still paid only $15 per game. Their indomitable director, Suzanne Mitchell (who ruled from 1976-89), might have fiercely protected their public image and private safety — at one point she describes taking on the mafia on their behalf — yet she also rigidly controlled their weight and even limited their water intake.

The tone is unabashedly partial, yet the women are such entertaining company it’s hard to mind. The affection they have for Mitchell (who died in 2016 and who lends this film its backbone) beams from the screen, as does their pride in the volunteer work that often took them overseas to buck up American troops.These recollections, backed by a treasure trove of archival footage, reveal a band of astonishingly hardworking young women, many with careers and all ferociously loyal to their brand and one another.“I was somebody, and that really was all that mattered,” one says. To have motives so clarifyingly pure, we should all be so lucky."

Hoffmann story is Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnston’s “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,” a hokey oddity that glissades along with a few charms and a pleasant score by James Newton Howard heavily incorporating themes from Tchaikovsky’s ballet (though there’s little dancing).Children who are 10 and under may be enchanted by the abundantly whimsical holiday-themed visuals; accompanying adults might chuckle at the movie’s leaden attempt at a girl-empowering message. Anyone squeamish about rodents — even ones that have been rendered sort of cute by CGI — might consider steering clear.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018On Christmas Eve in Victorian-era London, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), a budding inventor, receives a special, egg-shaped box left for her by her recently deceased mother. With it is a note that reads in part: “Everything you need is inside.” But lo! The key to unlock the egg is nowhere to be found, and thus her journey to discover what lies inside it (and, of course, herself) unfolds.At his annual holiday celebration, Clara’s artisan godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman, with an eye patch) leads her, “Alice in Wonderland”-like, to a new fantastical world — except instead of chasing a white rabbit, Clara chases a gray mouse that possesses the key she seeks. Once there, she meets the unfailingly loyal nutcracker Captain Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight) and the regents of three realms: Snow (Richard E. Grant), Flowers (Eugenio Derbez) and Sweets (Keira Knightley, as the Sugar Plum Fairy). Clara also encounters the eerie, circus-y fourth realm and its leader, Mother Ginger (a typically game Helen Mirren); also, many more mice.Knightley has quite a bit of fun with her role as the sprightly Sugar Plum, adopting a high-pitched, whack-a-doodle characterization that is Reese Witherspoon in “A Wrinkle in Time” meets Helena Bonham Carter in everything. Foy is fine as Clara — a “clever girl” as the movie likes to remind us — though Ashleigh Powell’s script gives the actress some of the film’s corniest moments.The ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who makes a brief appearance during the film and in the closing credits, is the highlight, gracefully unhindered by silly dialogue in two dance sequences. But ultimately, “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” is a family holiday movie that will do well enough for now; it probably won’t linger in your memory long enough to make it until the next inevitable adaptation comes around."

Or rather, he is in the midst of figuring that out about himself — what it means, how he might act on it — when his panicked parents enroll him in a conversion therapy program designed to change, or at least suppress, his sexuality.“Boy Erased,” adapted by Joel Edgerton from Garrard Conley’s memoir of the same title, is the second film this year to tackle the subject of conversion therapy, a technique that is a mix of religious dogma and dubious science whose cruelty and ineffectiveness have been amply documented. Like “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” directed by Desiree Akhavan and based on a young-adult novel by Emily Danforth, Edgerton’s film is set in the recent past, but its eye is very much on the present. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have outlawed conversion therapy, which still leaves a lot of young people vulnerable to the kind of treatment Jared undergoes.But “Boy Erased” tries to be more than a simple culture-war morality play, and it succeeds in some measure thanks to Lucas Hedges’s performance as Jared and those of Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe as his parents, Nancy and Marshall Eamons. Marshall, who owns a growing Ford dealership, is also a Baptist minister, a kind and scholarly man who loves his son. So does Nancy, who drops her son off every morning at Love in Action, leaving him in the care — or at the mercy — of its director, Mr. Sykes, played by Edgerton. More directly than her husband, Nancy must struggle to reconcile protective parental instincts with what she sees as the demands of her faith.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018At first, Jared himself accepts the Love in Action program, which combines the language of the recovery movement with stern Christian morality. His sexuality is defined as a choice and a sin, and he and his fellow “clients” are required to take “moral inventory” of their past behavior, and to participate in role plays, confessions and group discussions. Gradually, these activities, and Mr. Sykes’s way of dealing with his charges, tilts toward psychological and physical abuse. There is also an element of hucksterism to the enterprise, which costs desperate families a lot of money. When Mr. Sykes tries to bully Jared into dropping out of college and moving into one of Love in Action’s group homes, it seems likely that he has Nancy and Marshall’s money as well as their son’s immortal soul in mind.Mr. Sykes serves as a villain, backed up by a handful of sinister minions (notably a menacing former convict played by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers). But you may also suspect that he is an anguished and conflicted soul in his own right, a suspicion confirmed by an end-credits note about what the real Mr. Sykes is up to now. The mood of “Boy Erased” is not of indictment but of kindness, a virtue that Jared has clearly learned from his mother and father, even if they differ as to its meaning.The film’s sensitivity, though it is an ethical strength, is also a dramatic limitation. “Boy Erased” uses Jared’s story — which includes a high school attempt at heterosexual romance, a horrifying campus sexual assault and a chaste night spent in the bed of another man — primarily as a window into the issues raised by Conley’s book.This is admirable, but what’s missing is a sense of the texture and complication of the Eamons family’s life. Their personalities are too neatly diagramed, their conflicts too emphatically articulated, for “Boy Erased,” moving though it is, to feel like more than a summary of its own noble intentions."

A baroque blend of gibberish, mysticism and melodrama, the track is a can of earworms, one of those musical confections that get into your head whether you like it or not and stay there forever. Some of us who were devoted radio listeners in the mid-’70s will surely sit up in our death beds and whisper “Galileo, Galileo, Figaro” with our final breaths.“Bohemian Rhapsody,” the movie about Queen, lasts more than two hours, not a very long time by modern feature standards, even though it feels interminable. A baroque blend of gibberish, mysticism and melodrama, the film seems engineered to be as unmemorable as possible, with the exception of the prosthetic teeth worn by the lead actor, Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury, Queen’s lead singer. Those choppers may give you nightmares. And some of you who venture into the theater will surely be inspired to exclaim “Mama mia, let me go!”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 29, 2018[Read about Rami Malek’s preparation for the role.]Bismillah, no. Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Like most musical biopics, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which focuses on Mercury’s thrilling rise and partial fall, is a little of both. Beginning with Queen’s show-stealing performance at the Live Aid charity concert in 1985 — a very big deal at the time — the film flashes back to scruffier days in London, 15 years previously, when a young man named Farrokh Bulsara renamed himself Freddie Mercury and joined a band with a bunch of fellow college students.Freddie’s sometimes difficult relationship with his conservative Indian Parsi family forms one axis of the plot. (His stern father is played by Ace Bhatti, his doting mother by Meneka Das.) His generally harmonious, occasionally contentious relationship with his bandmates (Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello and Gwilym Lee, in fine hair) provides another. If you’ve ever wondered how “Bohemian Rhapsody” managed to be released — there was an argument with an industry bigwig, cheekily played by Mike Myers — or how Queen came up with the beat for “We Will Rock You” or the bass line for “Another One Bites the Dust,” your curiosity will be half-satisfied. You will also hear a lot of music, which is nice.Queen’s hits were always more about sound and sensation than sense, and Mercury’s lyrics were above all vehicles for his extraordinary voice. Sadly, absurdly, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is a plodding, literal-minded, conventional affair, in spite of Malek’s game attempt to mimic Mercury’s strutting theatricality onstage and his operatic moodiness in daily life.ImageQueen’s hits were always about sound and sensation.CreditAlex Bailey/20th Century FoxThe screenwriter (Anthony McCarten, who wrote “Darkest Hour” and “The Theory of Everything”) and the credited director, Bryan Singer (who was replaced by Dexter Fletcher late in the production), swaddle their subject in pageantry and spectacle, without supplying dramatic momentum or psychological insight. Mercury, as he struggles with his sexuality and his need for creative autonomy, is a collection of adjectives — imperious, vulnerable, witty, forlorn — in search of a personality.His marriage, to Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton), is idealized, though it’s also complicated by Freddie’s attraction to men. The film doesn’t seem to know what to do with homosexual desire — or with gay politics as the sexual liberation of the ’70s gave way to the AIDS crisis of the ’80s. Freddie’s love affair with Paul Prenter (Allen Leech of “Downton Abbey” fame), a member of Queen’s management team, is played for maximum scandal, a nightmare of debauchery, addiction and exploitation, with Freddie in the role of corrupted innocent.The reality was perhaps more interesting, and more nuanced, but in any case the overall narrative architecture of “Bohemian Rhapsody” is a Lego palace of clichés. A band strives to get to the top and tastes the sweet and sour sides of success. A misunderstood genius suffers for his art, alienates those who care for him most, and finds forgiveness and redemption. A lot of the story may be true, but none of it feels remotely authentic.Neither, however, does the film come close to capturing the glorious and unlikely artifice of Queen itself, a band whose scrambling of sexual and musical codes remains a remarkable phenomenon in the history of popular culture. “Bohemian Rhapsody” supplies a reminder that the band existed, but it conveys only a superficial, suspect sense of what it was. You can do better with YouTube and a stack of vinyl records. Easy come, easy go."

They’re in the South Korean countryside, near the border with North Korea, where the squawk of propaganda drifts in and out from loudspeakers. Now, though, in the velvety dusk light, the sound of Miles Davis’s ethereal trumpet fills the air, and the woman begins swaying, taking off her shirt. She is dancing for the men, but mostly she’s dancing in what feels like ecstatic communion between her and the world.Desire, ravenous and ineffable, shudders through “Burning,” the latest from the great South Korean director Lee Chang-dong. Set in the present, the movie involves the complicated, increasingly fraught relationships among three characters whose lives are tragically engulfed as desire gives way to rage. The story has the quality of a mystery thriller — somebody goes missing, somebody else tries to figure out why — one accompanied by the drumbeat of politics. The larger, more agonizing question here, though, involves what it means to live in a divided, profoundly isolating world that relentlessly drives a wedge between the self and others.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018The story opens the day that a young delivery man, Jongsu (Ah-in Yoo), meets a young woman, Haemi (Jong-seo Jun), in a chaotic, anonymous city. She works as store barker, dancing in scanty clothing while tempting shoppers with raffle prizes. Haemi hails Jongsu and reveals that they know each other from their hometown — he has no memory of her — then blurts out that she’s had plastic surgery. Later, she reminds him that when they were young he once crossed a street to tell her she was ugly, news she casually delivers while searching for a reaction that never comes.Jun gives a physically open, natural performance that works as a lovely counterpoint to Haemi’s cryptic actions — she has an unseen cat, peels an invisible tangerine — while Yoo invests Jongsu with a reserve that suggests social awkwardness that can seem self-interested. (Slack-jawed, Jongsu hunches like a man in retreat or a teenager who hasn’t settled into his adult body.) Despite his seeming indifference to Haemi, he responds to her friendliness, and before long they’re in bed. This nascent intimacy abruptly ends when she leaves on a trip. When she returns with a wealthy enigma, Ben (Steven Yeun), the three form an awkward triangle, a configuration that derails Jongsu.The movie is based on “Barn Burning,” a 1992 short story by Haruki Murakami that throbs with unspoken menace and shares its title with a far more blatantly violent 1939 story by William Faulkner. Lee nods at Faulkner (a favorite author of Jongsu whom Ben begins reading), but takes most of his cues from Murakami’s story. Lee retains its central triangle and some details, while making it his own by, for instance, changing the Miles Davis music. Mostly, Lee slowly foregrounds the uneasy violence that flickers through the Murakami to stunning, devastating effect.ImageAh-in Yoo’s character wants to be a writer, but he has to take over his family’s run-down farm.CreditWell Go USAWritten by Lee and Oh Jung-mi, “Burning” unfolds in realistic scenes that don’t necessarily seem to be advancing a strong theme. Things happen, casually. For the most part, the story follows Jongsu, who’s as closed-down as the door in the movie’s opening image. Seemingly friendless, he says he wants to write. But his father’s legal troubles have forced Jongsu to take over the family’s run-down farm alone. “What kind of ‘writing’ are you going to ‘create,’” his father’s lawyer mockingly asks Jongsu, as if to remind him of his place in life. The lawyer also compares Jongsu’s father to a protagonist in a story, a remark that suggests our stories are written for us.For the lawyer, fiction writing is clearly useless, and it certainly has no instrumental value for Jongsu’s father. That the movie is based on a story by a celebrated writer invests this seemingly uneventful scene with dark comedy, even if the larger point is the question of free will. (Is Jongsu writing his own story, or has it been determined by his father, whose rage landed him in jail?) The movie engages this question more directly once Ben — with his silky smiles and laid-back imperiousness — begins disrupting the equilibrium. “There is no right or wrong,” Ben tells Jongsu, after confessing that he torches derelict greenhouses. “Just the morals of nature.”An understated visual stylist, Lee shoots and edits this scene simply but elegantly, initially cutting between the two men, who are each isolated in the frame. They’re sitting fairly close yet seem worlds apart. It’s the same night as Haemi’s ravishing dance. But now she’s asleep inside, the sun has set, and the men are alone in an exchange that grows darker, figuratively and literally, as Jongsu talks about his unhappy childhood and Ben shares his worldview. As the scene progresses, Lee joins the men visually in two-shots that leave one or the other blurred, only to punctuate this back and forth with an image of them seated side by side like mirrored images.Here and throughout, Lee allows the actors to fill in their characters, letting them add pointillist detail to their portraits rather than smothering them in close-ups or self-regarding directorial virtuosity. All three leads are sensational (Yeun turns yawns and soft laughter into nightmares), giving performances that retain a sense of mystery that dovetails with the movie’s ambiguity. Again, things happen, often casually. Yet while each event expands the narrative — filling in the larger picture with nods at sexual relations, class divisions and a riven people — they don’t necessarily explain what happens or answer the fundamental question that burns through this brilliant movie."

Rather, for 40 or so years, it has served as a community arts center for the fictional town of Checkford, N.Y. Locals perform in its plays. Children volunteer backstage. Visiting artists give classes. Even school board meetings — where the Factory’s fiscal fate is decided — are held there.Managing this quaint but essential institution are the headstrong theater director Dorothea (Tyne Daly) and her actress partner Greta (Elisabeth Henry). Part One, subtitled “For the Sake of Gold,” focuses on their attempt to combat the efforts of a well-funded, Chinese-owned avant-garde arts duo named May Ray to open a space next door and siphon off a key grant that allows the Factory to survive. This forces Dorothea and Greta, along with their friend Jan (Glynnis O’Connor), the longtime editor of the Checkford Journal, to try to persuade members of the school board to vote against May Ray, who have powerful lawyers and movie stars working for them.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018The film embodies the eclectic nature of the work on display at the Factory. We see a performance of Euripides’s “Hecuba” as it is blocked, rehearsed and ultimately staged. An independent filmmaker (played by a delightfully crabby Janeane Garofalo) conducts a testy Q. and A. after a poorly attended screening. A shy writer — the kind who literally faints upon hearing that someone knows his work — reads a poem about a dying gondola.Wang (“In the Family”) understands that the more we watch these artists and amateurs’ efforts — even if they’re somewhat ridiculous — the better we’ll come to appreciate the homespun, democratic vitality of such work. Contrast that with the hilariously surreal spectacle of May Ray, who march in perfect unison, accompanied by the sound of prerecorded applause. They sell expensive accessories, along with a sense that culture is a one-way transaction: We create, you consume.ImageJessica Pimentel in “A Bread Factory.”CreditIn the Family LLCIf all this sounds symbolic of small-scale, local struggles within a globalized marketplace, that’s probably because it is. And “A Bread Factory” feels like the kind of offbeat film that might screen at the Bread Factory. There’s a theatricality to the acting here — it’s never stagy or hammy, but it has a precise, pointed clarity that grabs our attention. That self-conscious, performed quality emerges further during the more expressionistic Part Two, subtitled “Walk with Me a While,” which offers up bizarre musical numbers and tap dance routines featuring selfie sticks and cellphones.Wang is a singular artist, but he taps into a rich tradition. The focus on the workings of an American institution may remind some of the expansive comedies of Robert Altman or the documentaries of Frederick Wiseman. But also, the blurring of the line between performance and reality, the embrace of an intimate theatricality, recalls the work of Jacques Rivette. These are cinematic giants, and this director may be on his way to joining them."

Poetry feels like a better classification. A Wiseman film — the newest is “Monrovia, Indiana” — doesn’t make an argument or tell a story. It’s not trying to raise awareness of a cause or a problem, though awareness is its currency and its reward. You arrive at meaning through patterns and rhythms, and you have to do some work to apprehend the structure and the themes. In return, you arrive at a kind of knowledge that’s impossible to summarize, and also to forget.Monrovia is a town of around 1,000 people (according to the 2010 census) about a 30-minute drive southwest on I-70 from Indianapolis (according to Google Maps). Wiseman and his crew spent time there in what looks like the summer and fall, judging from the changing color of the ripening corn. There are picturesque, pastoral glimpses of cloud-flecked skies and green fields (the cinematographer is John Davey) that suggest the unchanging cycles of rural life.[Read about Frederick Wiseman, who is among the most important filmmakers working today.]The human reality of the film is more complicated, as you might expect. Wiseman observes people in groups and in public. There are no straight-to-camera interviews or home visits, but rather a tour of the rituals and routines of municipal life as citizens work, shop, eat, argue and play. As usual in a Wiseman film, we sit in on a lot meetings — of committees and organizations whose business includes zoning, water service and the placement of a park bench. We also visit a pizza place, an antique-car rally, a school and a veterinarian’s office, where a dog is put under general anesthesia so its tail can be cropped.That scene is gross, puzzling and oddly tender — a thing that happens in the world without context or explanation, and that requires skill, care and concentration on everyone’s part but the dog’s. The surgery’s inclusion can be taken as evidence of Wiseman’s broad curiosity and of his sly sense of humor, a warning to anyone who would try to impose a unifying interpretation on the film.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018It is, after all, about a slice of red-state America at a time of fierce political polarization. In the wake of the 2016 election, traveling to Monrovia — a mostly white town in the vice president’s home state — is hardly an idle or random decision, and the unavoidable political implications of “Monrovia, Indiana” give its observations an undeniable urgency.That may fade in the future, as the film takes its place in the canon of American vernacular art. In the meantime, what’s most striking is how far the national issues that dominant the news media seem from daily life in Monrovia. You can’t say that Wiseman tries to avoid those issues. He plants himself in a gun shop, an Evangelical church and the kind of diner where journalists like to go to test the faith of Trump voters. But instead of the president’s name, we hear jokes and anecdotes and a moving, startlingly cheerful sermon at an elderly woman’s funeral. (To quote Whitman again, on the United States: “Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall.”)If one lesson is that there’s more to life than politics, even in politicized times, another is that there is more to democracy than ideology. I’m not evoking some mythical common ground where we all come together in spite of our differences. There are no mythic places in Wiseman’s world, which is a land of practicality and procedure.VideoA closer look at the elements that make this documentary filmmaker's work come to life.Published OnApril 6, 2017CreditCreditMargot Balboni/Zipporah FilmsThe citizens and office holders of Monrovia are concerned with intensely local matters of land use, economic development and the availability of basic services. In this they are no different from the New Yorkers of “In Jackson Heights,” Wiseman’s 2015 film about that Queens neighborhood. Jackson Heights may be more diversely and densely populated than Monrovia, but the residents of both places speak a common language of civic engagement.That turns out to be an idiom rich in humor, as fans of “Parks and Recreation” (speaking of small towns in Indiana) will recall. Wiseman’s movies are often funny, and it’s not always easy to locate the source of the laughs. There is no mockery in a filmmaking method that is based on close and sympathetic attention. But he has demonstrated, over and over again, in high schools and libraries and state legislatures and schools, that nobility and ridiculousness are entwined in our DNA. We have a desperate, innate need to take ourselves seriously, and an element of comedy is almost always involved when we do. Or there would be if we could only see ourselves, which is precisely what Wiseman allows us to do.A teacher — or maybe he’s a coach of some kind; nobody is identified by name or title in a Wiseman film, unless it comes up naturally in conversation — delivers a lecture to a group of teenagers about a Hoosier basketball legend named Branch McCracken. The dynamism of the speaker and the boredom of his listeners feel performed, not for the benefit of Wiseman’s cameras so much as to fulfill the terms of a social transaction, one that seems both entirely familiar and deeply absurd.ImageA scene from “Monrovia, Indiana.”CreditZipporah FilmsLife is theater. Everyone is simultaneously actor and spectator. The old-timers telling stories in the coffee shop are acting out familiar roles, as are the members of the City Council and the participants in a solemn ritual at the Masonic temple. The minister sending his departed congregant off to glory may be the most obvious and energetic showman in “Monrovia, Indiana,” but that fact, rather than undermining his sincerity, is what confirms it.It isn’t spoiling this movie to tell you it ends in a graveyard. That’s where a lot of things end, including poems. While there’s no reason to suppose that this is Wiseman’s last movie, it doesn’t seem impossible that, at 88, he is aware of lengthening shadows and autumnal tints, of the fragility of perception and the finite nature of consciousness. “Monrovia, Indiana” is not precisely about any of those things, but it carries intimations of them, elegiac strains amid the doggerel of daily life."

As passengers walk up a long corridor toward the terminal, she stands and looks at them. And she sniffs. Sometimes her lip curls, revealing stubby, yellow teeth. Her jutting brow ridge furrows a bit. If something agitates her, she growls. Quietly, as if trying to suppress it.She’s good at her job. For some reason she can literally sniff out guilt. Usually she catches banal lawbreakers — underage kids trying to smuggle a little booze. But one day she detains a well-dressed man who has a SIM card full of child pornography.Tina, the main character in Ali Abbasi’s “Border,” lives at a remove from society, in a forest house she shares with a man who raises dogs that she can’t be around. Enlisted by higher authorities to dig deeper into the child pornography case, she’s suddenly around people who are curious about who she is and what she can do. She’s not entirely sure about these things either.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018Enter Vore, who has facial features and a physical bearing similar to Tina’s. Vore studies insect larvae and collects maggots. (Not just for the sake of collecting them, either, as we’ll soon learn.)When Vore comes off a boat and looks Tina over, Vore grunts too, in a manner like Tina’s and makes a face that toggles between a leer and a sarcastic sneer. Tina (Eva Melander) doesn’t know what to make of Vore (Eero Milonoff). But Vore has a thorough understanding of the secrets that Vore and Tina share. Secrets that Tina’s father, who’s struggling with dementia, has withheld from her for years.I don’t know a lot about Swedish folklore, so I was in an especially cold state as I went into this movie, written by Abbasi, Isabella Eklof and John Ajvide Lindqvist (also the writer of the 2008 film “Let the Right One In”), from Lindqvist’s short story. As cold as possible is a good way to see it. This is a movie that aims to startle in overt and subtextual ways; the less known before viewing, the better.In its first sequences, “Border” is shot and edited in a straightforward style that suggests a documentary. The makeup work, by a large crew, alters the appearance of Melander and Milonoff most credibly. The actors are stalwart in depicting the unusual behavior of their characters. A scene in which Vore tries to convince Tina that the maggots that seem to be the biggest part of Vore’s diet are indeed scrumptious is one of the most delightfully squirm-inducing moments here.As the movie continues, it splits its narrative. One thread follows Tina as she helps the authorities catch the child pornographers, another shows Vore and Tina enthusiastically and sexually explicitly exploring their affinities. And here “Border,” which won the top prize in Cannes’ “Un Certain Regard” slate this year, becomes a somewhat more conventional genre film. Indeed, the final plot twist will elicit a nod from anyone conversant with 1980s Hollywood thrillers. But by this point, the movie has served up so many surprises, jumpy moments, and occasional but well-earned laughs that the familiarity is acceptable."
"239","Shirkers","",1,"JEANNETTE CATSOULIS","Review: In ‘Shirkers,’ Stolen Footage and Dashed Dreams","Sandi Tan’s captivating documentary about the theft of her first movie by a charismatic con man is both mystery and manhunt.","2018-10-25","2018-10-26","2018-11-02 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/movies/shirkers-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of Shirkers,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/arts/shirkers1/shirkers1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"“Shirkers” is the director Sandi Tan’s first feature — the first, at least, that anyone has been allowed to see. Back in 1992, as a rebellious 19-year-old in Singapore, she wrote and starred in a subversive road movie about a female assassin, enlisting her closest friends, Jasmine Ng and Sophie Siddique, to help with editing and production. The completed project, captured on 70 canisters of donated 16-millimeter film, was then relinquished to its director: a slippery, middle-aged American film teacher named Georges Cardona. They never saw him again.Like a photograph slowly developing before our eyes, “Shirkers” (which was also the title of the original picture) is both mystery and manhunt, a captivating account of shattered friendship and betrayed trust. The skill of the editing (by Tan and two colleagues), though, is key: interviews are woven organically throughout the narrative, and little nuggets of rewarding information are withheld until the final stretches. In this way, the movie is constantly surprising and delighting us, not least in its creative use of the original film’s footage. Those long-lost images, miraculously recovered by Tan two decades after their disappearance, would send her on a quest to reconnect with her former collaborators and make sense of her past.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018The result is a strange, warm and winding tale of movie love and knifing disappointment, nudged along by Tan’s soft and pleasant narration. An oddly intense teenager with a widely read zine and a variety of international pen pals, she chafed against a rigidly conservative government that banned chewing gum and stifled access to the indie cinema she and her friends craved. When they met Cardona at a filmmaking workshop, he seemed a charismatic kindred spirit, and Tan was intellectually smitten despite the suspicions of her friends. A 40-year-old married man who liked to drive around at night with much younger women, just talking about movies, didn’t seem quite kosher.Those drives would continue after Tan moved to America, including a road trip to New Orleans where Cardona grew up. The relationship might have been platonic, yet it was ardent, giving his treachery the stab of a love gone wrong. This infuses “Shirkers” with a powerful sense of loss, of chances missed and a what-might-have-been tone that isn’t entirely about those stolen canisters.Present-day interviews with Jasmine and Sophie reveal the ingenuity of their contributions and deepen our understanding of the Cardona dynamic, as well as uncover the burrs of disputes that linger in the women’s memories. Somehow, though, the film never sinks into sourness. This is especially surprising as those original clips, shot on the streets of Singapore with a cast of family and friends, are bright and quirky and inventive enough to suggest the possibility of something wonderful and weird: the baby steps of a cult classic.These ghostly, long-ago scenes, artifacts from a painful past, at times turn this new “Shirkers” into an act of exorcism, a purging of regrets and questions that have bedeviled the adult Tan, now a novelist in Los Angeles, for longer than she would like. The love she has for that footage remains inextricably bound up with nostalgia for her younger self, for the dreams of a determined young woman who longed for a bigger world and a wider audience. A shirker, she tells us, is someone who runs away. On the evidence of this movie, Cardona might not have been the only one running."

All are young, naïve and engaged in deceptively simple errands. Zanele (the lovely Zimkhitha Nyoka) is delivering a young girl to her mother in the city; Nkulu (Sibusiso Msimang) must retrieve the body of his father, a former mine worker, and return it to his grieving family; and Nhlanhla (Sihle Xaba) has been promised a lucrative job by his prosperous cousin, Xolani (a vivid Warren Masemola).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018What the three encounter, though, is a city filled with large betrayals and dangerous seductions, a place where crime and corruption are rampant and the poor mere tools to be used and abused. Using real experiences shared by the homeless in story workshops, Omotoso — who was also a creator of the  South African television series “A Place Called Home” — directs with empathy and without sentimentality. Violence is swift and searing, and the cinematographer Kabelo Thathe’s gorgeous aerial shots and electric street scenes belie the fact that this is his first narrative feature. In the middle of a shootout or on top of a landfill, his camera tells a story that reaches beyond the script.Representative of the millions of South African migrants who have traveled to cities from rural villages, “Vaya” (which means “to go” in Tsotsitaal) illuminates the gulf between those who leave and those who remain. Questioning the very definition of a criminal, the movie abandons our three young searchers in moral transit. After the screen goes dark, we’re still worrying about them."

Mostly set in a suburb of Fort Worth, it follows Adrian, who left his evangelical Christian family to work in advertising in New York, as he visits home for the first time in three years.Greeted, if that’s what you can call it, by his gruff, taciturn father (Michael Chiklis) at the airport, he’s met at home by his mother (Virginia Madsen), who’s almost desperately radiating affection.

He’s also not well; AIDS has taken several close friends from him, and he’s recently learned that he too has contracted the virus. When Adrian discovers that Andrew is secretly listening to Madonna cassettes — secular music is forbidden in the house — the bond the brothers now share is overshadowed by the dread Adrian has nursed since the movie’s first shot.The meticulously composed movie sees Adrian negotiating with his nerve and his fear. A catch-up with an initially angry ex-girlfriend (Jamie Chung) painfully demonstrates how hard a time he has really trusting anyone.Cory Michael Smith’s performance as Adrian is a quiet marvel in a movie that’s superbly acted all around. The film’s intimate consideration of still-enormous issues is intelligent, surprising and emotionally resonant."

The camera frequently hides with Mina in the shadows as she observes intruders who may become her prey. Rather than relying on shocks, “The Dark” takes a sober approach to its realistically gruesome imagery. Mina and Alex are survivors of childhood abuse, and bear the scars of their suffering.

(Blockchain means privacy! And also, look at these supermarket shoppers in Jordan who pay with eye scans instead of cash.) The film also conflates issues. You can believe that blockchain has potential and still think that Bitcoin is a bubble — as many economists, not just banking executives with vested interests, do.By the time Rosario Dawson, the narrator, points out that blockchain will likely require some form of regulation to survive, the movie has become an unwitting endorsement of the status quo."

To the horror of his wife, who was just finding her footing after their loss, Ben becomes convinced that by changing his dreams, he might also change his daughter’s fate. As Ben disengages, Dorff’s disarming, laid-back presence draws attention to the character’s ambiguity — he is both a father understandably disturbed by grief and a husband failing to support his wife.The director David Gleeson bridges the gap between reality and dreaming by keeping the visual realm of Ben’s subconscious relatively mundane while his regular life is prone to dramatic lighting and spectacular scenery. But the gimmick that propels the action undercuts the characters. If Ben can change his past, it becomes challenging to take interest in his present.It falls on the performances to add subtle touches to the narrative’s broad strokes. George is admirably warm as the earthbound Hazel, and Dorff suggests the selfishness of his character’s selfless desperation."

The year is 1999 and some kind of worldwide catastrophe is unfolding, but Nicola’s main problems seem to be a lack of outerwear and the ability to foresee her own murder. Whether her lover-cum-killer will be the besotted banker (Theo James), the cretinous criminal (an odiously mouth-breathing Jim Sturgess), or Samson himself is a riddle we could not possibly be less interested in solving.The arrival of Johnny Depp as a ludicrously dressed gangster with an entourage of weirdos does nothing to reverse that position. (It does, however, signal that the movie’s costume designer was having much more fun than any of its stars.) Failing to even glancingly approximate the book’s trippy energy or linguistic dazzle, Cullen ricochets between Heard’s slow-motion, perfume-ad close-ups and lurid, comic-book noir. The result is alienating and bogus, as senseless as the image of Nicola’s floating, diaphanous panties.“I’m pretty worried that the critics are going to call you a male fantasy figure,” Samson frets.

Eldar moved to the United States years ago, and in monologues and conversations with Abbas, the two bemoan the rise of extremist ideology on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They also reflect on anger, identity and belonging.“After years in America, I feel confused and disconnected: one foot here, one foot there, a foreigner in both lands,” Eldar says, echoing similar feelings by Abbas about his own circumstances.Their opinions are perceptive. Yet even with its short running time, the film can wander, with nature shots and other footage that seems attached only to add lyricism. In place of some kind of discovery there is mostly lamentation. That may be a valid response to events in Israel, but it’s not always a good way to engage a viewer.By the end, these two men and others agree that there was hope in the past. Now, however, the future appears bleak for Israelis and Palestinians. “The situation is deteriorating rapidly,” Abbas’s son says. “I’m not afraid of what’s happened so far.

Watching it is like having a good time by proxy.

In storybook terms, its bad, bad trouble involves a young, outwardly naïve American dancer, Susie (Dakota Johnson), whose tenure at an all-female school in Germany turns progressively strange. The other less interesting possession involves the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who has taken a 1970s freakout from Dario Argento and turned it into a bloated fantasy of violently consuming female power. It’s the old vagina dentata scare show, this time fancied up with art-house pretensions.With its garish color, canted angles and baroque violence, the first “Suspiria” is still adept at unsettling your equilibrium, which is fitting for a film that renders psychosis into visual style. (Among its most memorable elements is a fantastically creepy soundtrack, which turns music-box tinkling into a maddening refrain.) Argento’s vulgar expressionism must have appealed to Guadagnino. A cinematic sensualist, Guadagnino (“Call Me by Your Name”) makes stories filled with volcanic emotions, pretty people and ravishing backdrops that — with color and light and technique — he imbues with a sumptuous tactility you almost reach for, as if to caress.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018This time, he seems more interested in making you recoil while also saying Something. What precisely he wants to say amid all the carefully choreographed bloodletting and disembowelment chic is unclear, other than some women are beautiful and erotically beguiling but also mysterious and murderous. (It’s a story women know by heart and is dustier than even Argento’s shocker.) Also: Tilda Swinton can do — and wear — anything, including a long curtain of hair and a prosthetic penis. Mostly, the new “Suspiria” is an exercise in grindhouse genre, a seeming departure for a director whose work is usually, at times to its detriment, calibrated for art-house consumption.[Read our interview with Luca Guadagnino and Tilda Swinton.]Written by David Kajganich, the new “Suspiria” follows the general sweep of the first one, opening on a murky, stormy note. It’s 1977 (the year Argento’s film was released), and Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz), an American who studies at the Helena Markos Dance Company in West Berlin, is having a meltdown. Fleeing to her therapist, Dr. Josef Klemperer (Swinton, swaddled in latex and old-world gentlemen’s clothing), Patricia ominously babbles while she jumps around the shrink’s office and he dutifully scratches down his notes. She seems unhinged, rattled, and is soon conveniently gone from the scene, though only after leaving a bag and a notebook filled with cryptic musings.The notebook becomes Dr. Klemperer’s way into the story; Susie begins ours when she arrives at the school; eventually these paths converge. Susie has landed at the school uninvited but dazzles one of its matrons, a choreographer, Madame Blanc (also Swinton), and is invited into the institution’s weird, sisterly ranks. Soon, Susie is giggling in the school’s corridors, peeking into its dark corners and dancing, flailing, twisting under Madame Blanc’s strict watch. Before you know it, one employee has slit her own throat, a student has danced until her bones have broken, and some matrons are guffawing while waving a sharp, shiny scythe in front of a man’s tender vitals.ImageTilda Swinton as Madame Blanc, a choreographer at the dance institute.CreditAlessio Bolzoni/Amazon StudiosSo, you know, the usual, but with ostentatious chapter breaks and narrative padding, including some dead-end references both to 1970s German politics (cue the tear gas, riots and Baader-Meinhof mentions) and, more egregiously, to the Holocaust. These allusions don’t amount to anything and come off like futile, nonsensical bids to explain the German setting. The school faces the Berlin Wall, as Guadagnino repeatedly reminds us, to no particular end. Like the references to Germany’s violent politics in the 1970s and the nods at Susie’s Mennonite background (which emerges in puzzle-like flashbacks), the wall is strictly ornamental, an emblem of meaning by (hoped for) association.As expected, almost everything and everyone looks casually perfect, which is what you would expect from Guadagnino. It’s certainly pleasurable to watch the wild-eyed Patricia scuttle through the art-directed clutter of Dr. Klemperer’s office and then pause to pick up a carefully placed Jung volume. It’s even more amusing to see Susie navigating the school’s fun-house interior, with its secretive mirrors and boxes-within-boxes design. The cast offers its own pleasures, especially Swinton (in her Madame Blanc role) and Johnson, a performer whose lightly breathy voice and low-key, almost affectless charisma can quickly turn unsettling, menacing. (She’d make a haunting Manson girl.)As the first hour of “Suspiria” grinds into the second and beyond (the movie runs 152 minutes), it grows ever more distended and yet more hollow. Unlike Argento, who seemed content to deliver a nastily updated fairy tale in 90 or so minutes, Guadagnino continues casting about for meaning, which perhaps explains why he keeps adding more stuff, more mayhem, more dances. (The choreography is by Damien Jalet.) By the time the dancers gather for their culminating frolic in a show dubiously called Volk — “the people,” a loaded idea in German history — the movie has slid so far off the rails that even its final big bloody show, with its deli cuts and Busby Berkeley moves, can’t save it."

The film touches on a lot of hot-button matters, including the 2016 election; racial profiling; and the difficulties of being a single parent and of earning a living wage. But it keeps the issues largely in the background. The goal, as the title suggests, is simply to present lives as they’re lived from moment to moment.Long stretches of the movie, from the Spanish-born writer-director Antonio Méndez Esparza, making his second feature, could easily be mistaken for a documentary, an impression that Méndez Esparza deepens though his visual style. Whether the setting is a classroom, a parking lot or a restaurant, he often keeps his camera at a slight distance from his (mostly nonprofessional) actors, maintaining a vantage point that we’ve come to associate with fly-on-the-wall filmmaking.But this is a drama — specifically, a mother-son story. The film opens with the teenage Andrew (Andrew Bleechington) and his mother, Regina (Regina Williams), on their way to court. Andrew, who is on probation after breaking into cars, has been skipping mandated counseling appointments, and it’s not the first time he’s upset Regina.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 22, 2018She’s raising him, along with his much younger sister, on her own in Northern Florida, where she works as a waitress. (The film’s sense of place is especially strong.) Andrew’s father is in prison and plays a minimal role in his life. (“Sure,” Andrew says disinterestedly when a counselor asks if he would like to talk to his father more often; it’s tough for anyone to get Andrew to break his defensive silence.) Regina cautiously begins a romance with Robert (Robert Williams), who might fill that absence, though he’s hardly perfect, and Andrew rebels at the prospect.Describing the trajectory of “Life and Nothing More” makes it sound like a civics lesson, and in some scenes — we see Andrew learning about the Constitution and lawmaking in school — Méndez Esparza even cultivates that impression, overplaying his hand.But the bulk of the movie is more like the reverse: a slow accumulation of closely observed moments — Regina and Robert’s flirting during a pool game; Regina working while election returns play on a TV behind her; Andrew attending an anger management session — that add up to something much more nuanced, a portrait of lives that can’t be reduced to statistics."

After all, the sky above that smoke is so blue, and the town below seems so tidy. The impression doesn’t last long.ImageCarey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal in “Wildlife.”CreditScott Garfield/IFC FilmsFires are indeed consuming the mountain forests; kids in the local school attend a special class session in which they’re warned of the dangers of its spreading closer. One student, a lifetime local, tells her classmate, who is new in town, that he needn’t pay attention. If the destructive force of the fire gets close enough, it will be too late for them to do anything about it.Set in the 1960s, this superb film, directed by Paul Dano from a script he and Zoe Kazan adapted from the 1990 Richard Ford novel, puts its main adult characters in the way of destructive forces of their own conjuring soon enough. Jerry Brinson (Jake Gyllenhaal), an American dreamer whose air of optimism seems forced, has moved his wife, Jeanette (Carey Mulligan), and teenage son, Joe (the new classmate, played by Ed Oxenbould), a little too frequently for either of their liking. After Jerry is fired as a golf pro at a country club, Jeanette grits her teeth and tries to offer solutions. He is offered his job back — golf pros are presumably difficult to come by in these parts — but insists, “I won’t work for people like that.” Instead, he takes a low-paying job as a firefighter in the nearby mountains, leaving Jeanette and Joe to fend for themselves.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 9, 2018Joe, quiet and industrious, gets a part-time job at a photo shop, while Jeanette, who has been working as a swimming instructor, notices the friendly attention of one of her students, Warren Miller (Bill Camp). He is an older, stocky, prosperous owner of a car dealership, and she decides to return his attention. Rather than hide her escalating liaison from her son, she drags him into the affair, as if she needed Joe to understand just how unhinged her married life has finally made her.“Wildlife” is a domestic drama both sad and terrifying. The entire cast does exceptional work (Oxenbould is an exciting find), but the movie is anchored by Mulligan, who gives the best performance of any I’ve seen in film this year. The stiff simulation of determined cheer with which Jeanette often speaks has a vehemence to it, particularly in the sibilants she pronounces. Her physical bearing is also striking: In this role, Mulligan can say more by just tensing her neck than most actors can with a lengthy, impassioned soliloquy. It is mesmerizing to watch the character struggle with the question of whether or not she is entitled to her rage before she lets go and gives into it — and finds that doing so gives her no satisfaction whatsoever.Dano’s direction is meticulous in every respect, which enables him to keep the characters at a remove that is both cleareyed and compassionate. The sharp cinematography by Diego Garcia is ideal for Dano’s purpose. The whole of the film is a potent collaboration in every respect, and a remarkable directorial debut."

Locking the viewer in two cramped, drab rooms, he builds suspense with little more than a single character and a few voices on a telephone. But the ingenious screenplay (by Moller and Emil Nygaard Albertsen) reaches beyond the solving of a mystery to paint a psychological portrait of the man at its center.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018CreditCreditNikolaj Moeller/Magnolia PicturesThat would be Asger Holm (an astonishing Jakob Cedergren), a resentful police officer demoted to emergency-response telephone duty while waiting for an unspecified disciplinary proceeding.

Discarding the rules that require him to simply relay the information to field officers, Asger resolves to stay on the case, frantically using his detecting skills while concealing his efforts from the dispatchers around him.Unfolding in real time, this immediately involving story bends and turns in surprising, sometimes horrifying ways. Enriched by Oskar Skriver’s marvelous sound editing, which takes us from a speeding van to a bloodcurdling crime scene with equal authenticity, the movie smoothly blends police procedural with character study. What’s happening on the end of Asger’s phone line is gripping enough, but what’s happening inside his head — illuminated by Jasper Spanning’s almost abusive close-ups — is every bit as fascinating."

That’s the question lying at the heart of the Austrian documentarian Ruth Beckermann’s informative and unnerving “The Waldheim Waltz.” Using mostly contemporaneous material — TV reports and news conferences, as well as documentary video footage she shot herself — the filmmaker follows the controversial 1986 presidential campaign of the Austrian politician Kurt Waldheim, whose candidacy was plunged into chaos by new revelations regarding his Nazi past.Waldheim had portrayed himself as an honest soldier who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht during World War II and returned home in 1941 after getting wounded on the Eastern front. While rumors of further Nazi association had bubbled during his term as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1981, it wasn’t until Waldheim sought higher domestic office that more damning evidence emerged — particularly of his involvement in the 1942 massacre of Yugoslav partisans in Kozara and the 1943 deportation of Jews from Salonika, the historical name for Thessaloniki, Greece.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 9, 2018The candidate claimed he was the victim of an international conspiracy — by American politicians, the World Jewish Congress and others. As unsettling footage Beckermann herself shot at the time proves, many voters not only sided with him, but went even further, openly spouting anti-Semitic vitriol.The director views Waldheim’s candidacy as a moment when Austria could no longer see itself as an innocent casualty of Nazi rule. The country had often presented itself, we’re told, as “Hitler’s first victim,” and people like Waldheim as honest soldiers caught on the wrong side. The truth, it seems, was a lot more complicated, and disturbing.Beckermann, who narrates, makes no claims to objectivity. She tells us at the outset that she participated in protests against Waldheim. Some of the most fascinating parts of her film show the growth and coalescing of her fellow activists, who became invested in stopping his candidacy. As such, “The Waldheim Waltz” sometimes dances between a brisk, present-tense recounting of political history and a more wandering, personal reflection on the filmmaker’s history.But it leans more toward the political. Beckermann wants not so much to contextualize as to invoke — with the hope, perhaps, that placing us in the middle of this debate will create its own context. Indeed, watching Waldheim’s campaign, it’s hard not to think about the present day — from the emergence of old hatreds, to the closure of elite ranks around their own, to the weaponizing of nationalism against the truth. The film may end in 1986, but the darkness it reveals still looms."

McFarland) is immediately suspicious.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018The grimy ambience and a few winning moments with the actors buy the movie some time before an inevitably violent climax, although much of that good will is squandered in a showy suspense sequence that appears to unfold in a single take. (The “shot” has probably been stitched together, but either way, it serves the crew members’ C.V.s more than the story.) The epilogue reaches for a gravitas the material simply doesn’t earn."

Even so, it requires all their considerable skills to stop this soapy family drama from sliding into complete banality.Based on Chomko’s own family history, the story circles the slow drift into dementia of Ruth (Blythe Danner), the beloved wife of Bert (a perfect Robert Forster). Caught at the outset wandering into a snowstorm in her coat and nightie, Ruth is retrieved to face her adult children and a teenage granddaughter, who have reluctantly gathered in the couple’s Chicago home to fight about what is to be done.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 9, 2018There’s so much bickering, though, that the dementia itself — unlike in Sarah Polley’s heartbreaking 2007 drama, “Away From Her” — soon fades into the background. Bridget (Hilary Swank), a dithering California chef, is unwilling to support her brother, Nicky (Michael Shannon), in his plan to install Ruth in something called a “memory care” facility. While Nicky stews over Bridget’s favored-child status and Bert’s refusal to respect his bar-owning career choice, Bridget chafes over her atrophied marriage and a whiny daughter (Taissa Farmiga) who’s having second thoughts about college. Bert, for his part, clings to denial and his belief that commitment is the only marital vow that matters.Classily shot by Roberto Schaefer, “What They Had” is the sort of movie that can earn a pass purely on the sensitivity of its subject matter. And though occasional bursts of spikiness suggest that Chomko has a more unexpected story to tell, the narrative beats of this one — even without its eye-rolling final shot — are audible well in advance of the end credits."

After being found insane at his trial and released from charges, he returned to his native Japan. At home, he found celebrity via books and manga about his crime; he also appeared in pornographic movies (explicit clips are shown in the film). Now largely paralytic, he is cared for by his brother Jun, who is also a looming presence. We see Jun later on wrapping his own arm in barbed wire and stabbing at his skin with butcher knives.“Cannibalism is very much nourished by fetishistic desire,” the killer rationalizes at a point early in the movie. But the filmmakers, who are affiliated with Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab, almost aggressively avoid providing any back story or context here. Keeping their subjects in clammy close-up, they do not explain, among other things, why Sagawa, who is about 70 years old, is so debilitated — nor why one of his caretakers is dressed in a maid’s costume. Still, the film’s final images of him, totally dependent on his keepers, achieve a kind of morbid poignancy.The filmmakers, who made “Leviathan,” the striking 2012 immersion into commercial fishing, seem to be arguing that Sagawa needs to be understood beyond moralistic preconceptions. “Caniba” did not make the case for me. I consider Sagawa repellent, and the movie an exercise in intellectualized scab-picking."

But it wasn’t out of snobbery. Printing press workers were on strike, and nothing was being published (not even the news of a new pope). Vincent Canby, the chief film critic then, did circle back to the movie the next year, but we’ve never given this horror classic a proper review. So, with a new “Halloween” due Friday, we asked Jason Zinoman to rectify a 40-year oversight.The original “Halloween” always struck me as an experimental art film in a bloody exploitation mask.John Carpenter’s relentlessly terrifying masterpiece about babysitters and the murderous Michael Myers has been imitated, paid homage to and remade (an update of the original opens Friday) so many times since its premiere in 1978 that its radicalism is easy to overlook. Michael Myers is not like other movie monsters. He doesn’t lurch or creep or race. He walks, steadily. His physicality and clothes tell you nothing about him. He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life.[Read our movie review of the new Halloween remake starring Jamie Lee Curtis.]What little the movie tells us about this founding father of the slasher film comes from Dr. Loomis, his former psychiatrist, played with brio by Donald Pleasence. “I was told there was nothing left,” he says about Myers. “No reason, no conscience, no understanding.”Michael Myers’s mask isn’t hiding anything. It is all there is.Most great horror monsters are stand-ins for some cultural anxiety like fear in the atomic age or scientific overreach or racism. Part of the reason “Halloween” has aged so well — when it screened at a Times Square theater this month, the crowd still gasped and screamed — is that it plays no topical notes and wastes little time on character development, plot, theme or any other elements extraneous to the critical business of sending shudders down your spine.It’s tempting to be cynical or dismissive about this bare-bones moviemaking. In this paper, Vincent Canby wrote that the movie aimed so low, “analysis has no place.” In her New Yorker review, Pauline Kael called “Halloween” just “dumb scariness.”“Halloween” certainly is ruthlessly simple, pivoting between a group of teenage girls talking about and having sex and the perspective of a sociopathic killer who escaped from a hospital to terrorize them. Some have read conservative sexual politics into the story, and Carpenter has spent decades denying that he was trying to punish the promiscuous, a tough case to make when (spoiler alert!) the girls who have sex are killed while the virgin survives. A moralistic streak, not to mention a prurient one, is buried in the DNA of cheap horror that is part of this movie.But what’s onscreen is a marriage of commerce and art. The marketable standby of a killer stalking scantily clad women is elevated by elegantly orchestrated camerawork that keeps you disoriented, moment by moment, as the beating notes of the soundtrack remind you something bad and unstoppable is on the way. From the first shot to the last, this movie is confidently guided by a specific and committed vision.Carpenter was no novice. You can see the hallmarks of “Halloween” in his previous work, including two genre movies — “Dark Star” and “Assault on Precinct 13” — that also featured unmotivated killers, as well his screenplay for “Eyes of Laura Mars,” which is about a fashion photographer who via a psychic connection suddenly starts seeing through the eyes of a serial killer. But “Halloween” was a purer and more uncompromising example of his brand of suspense filmmaking.The precision and timing of the movie’s chilling chase scenes reveal an artist who understands that truly resonant scariness could not be dumb. It required deft craft and a coherent perspective on fear. Horror common wisdom states that the scariest evil is unknown, inexplicable and random; once the monster is revealed in a movie and the mind makes sense of it, much of the fear it inspires dissipates. So keeping Michael Myers a blank navigates around this problem. But he’s not the only void here.Carpenter pointedly ends the movie with a montage of empty spaces: Bare rooms, abandoned streets, a darkened house. His signature propulsive synthesizer music, which has become perhaps his most influential aesthetic contribution to the current vogue of horror, is playing as the breathing of Michael Myers gets louder. You hear the air go in his mouth and then escape. He’s everywhere and nowhere.Decades before “Scream” ushered in the trend of horror movies that knowingly commented on themselves, “Halloween” adopted a wry self-consciousness that constantly drew attention to itself. By casting Janet Leigh’s daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, as his heroine, Laurie Strode, Carpenter invites comparisons to “Psycho,” which starred Leigh. Curtis, making her film debut, turned out to be a natural, delivering a persuasive performance of operatic panic that suggested a ferocious core.The movie repeatedly places the viewer in the perspective of the killer, but it also often puts Michael Myers near the audience, lurking at the corner of the screen with his back to us like the characters in “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” Michael likes to watch, and he often seems more interested in a good scare than an efficient kill. In one memorable scene, he stages a grave for one of his victims, and when Laurie discovers it, two other corpses pop out at her, a jury-rigged spectacle. If Michael Myers betrays any personality at all, it’s as a showman of scares, albeit a much cruder one than John Carpenter.In horror, the jack-in-the-box scare (think of the head floating out of the boat in “Jaws”) is the quickest way to get a scream, but the still shocks (the twin girls in “The Shining”) are the ones that linger with you. “Halloween” has them both, but it specializes in the second.After the credit sequence, “Halloween” takes the point of view of a 6-year-old Michael Myers. It’s not as famous as the virtuoso tracking shot, but the most jarring moment occurs after the boy steps outside and his mask is pulled off. As the camera recedes, his parents stare at him, barely moving, while Michael gazes into the distance. This paralyzed threesome just stands there for nearly 30 seconds. It feels like a crazily long time, escalating tension and turning this scene into a stylized uncanny, a simulacrum of a freeze frame.It’s an odd choice — to hold the pause this long — but it’s the kind of unpredictable one that makes this movie such an unsettling and fascinating classic."

The film opens on a forested area with distant gunshots. This gloomy image is punctuated by a woman’s heart-wrenching cry that startles Abbas (Eriq Ebouaney) awake.Then, a statuesque woman with a beautiful Afro appears in the hallway, a smile on her face; she disappears as Abbas moves toward her. It’s possible she is a ghost, or a figment of his imagination. His young daughter, Asma (Aalayna Lys), is also roused from sleep, and tells of having dreamed of her deceased mother.“I miss her, too,” Abbas assures Asma. He comforts her with her mother’s lullaby, but a third disembodied voice — a woman’s — joins in. They look as though they can hear this woman, Abbas’s eyes searching for the source, to no avail. The instance is touching and chilling, like much of “A Season in France.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018Haroun lives in these quiet, understated moments throughout, be it a tense scene between lovers who have drifted apart or a cheerful birthday dinner celebration. And while the story plays a bit with the notion of the supernatural, the spirit foregrounded here is more tangible: an ominous sense of restlessness and curtailed dreams.Back home, Abbas was a high school French teacher; now in Paris, anxiously awaiting political asylum, he works at a food market. Asma and her brother, Yacine (Ibrahim Burama Darboe), have difficulty adjusting, as the family is forced to move frequently. Étienne (Bibi Tanga), Abbas’s brother, struggles with feelings of inadequacy, having gone from being a philosophy professor to a pharmacy security guard.Thankfully there are episodes of reprieve, like an impromptu pillow fight between Abbas and his children. And there is Abbas’s romantic partner, Carole (Sandrine Bonnaire), a warm Frenchwoman whom the children adore. Her love for Abbas is unfailing, yet his uncertain future and the lingering pain from the loss of his wife prevent him from being able to fully commit to Carole emotionally.As Abbas, Ebouaney anchors this delicate balancing act between optimism and dread, embodying vulnerability while trying to remain hopeful and authoritative in front of Asma and Yacine. The children, for their part, occasionally launch bitter admonishments at their father: “You said you knew people in France who would welcome us,” Yacine complains. “You lied to us,” adds Asma, in that blunt, uninhibited way children speak when hurting.The film builds toward an explicit condemnation of Europe’s handling of the refugee crisis, encouraging the viewer’s fury at the family’s forced circumstances. But it doesn’t need this. Haroun has already so carefully demonstrated, through wordless scenes and intimate world building, a heartbreaking sadness that haunts long after the movie ends."

The meals at Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, where he’s been cooling his heels all these years, must be unusually nutritious.On the other hand, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the feisty Illinois babysitter who once eluded Michael’s stalk-and-slash spree, has aged more credibly than her nutjob nemesis. Now a grandmother and self-described basket case, Laurie has weathered two failed marriages and estrangement from her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer), who’s scarred by a childhood steeped in doomsday preparation. Eyes burning beneath a fluff of gray hair, Laurie lives in a fortresslike home with a hidey hole in the kitchen and gun cases in place of art, convinced that Michael will one day return for her. (She may be paranoid, but she’s no fool: When two true-crime-seeking English podcasters show up at her steel gates, she says little to help them and sends them packing.)[Read The New York Times review of the original movie]ImageMichael Myers is back and out for blood in the new “Halloween.”CreditUniversal PicturesAnd return Michael does (played by James Jude Courtney, with a cameo by the originating actor, Nick Castle), escaping from a prison-transfer van on Halloween night and lumbering back to finish the job. At this point, Green (who wrote the script with Jeff Fradley and Danny McBride) makes a crucial decision. Brushing aside the mostly wan intervening attempts to resurrect Carpenter’s minimalist masterpiece, he has made a straight-up sequel, a rematch between heroine and villain. This isn’t a wisecracking, tongue-in-cheek picture: Green wants us to believe in his Bogeyman, and Curtis is his ace card. Leaving no room for winks or giggles, she makes Laurie’s long-festering terror the glue that holds the movie together.And we need her, because otherwise the filmmakers have little but a conventional slasher movie sprinkled with memory triggers and callbacks to its source. The familiar voice of Donald Pleasence (actually a sound-alike), as Michael’s former psychiatrist, is heard on an audio tape, and iconic images — a slatted closet door; a hulking, streetlamp-lit figure — press our pleasure buttons. As does the familiar musical theme, goosing the action as fresh babysitters and randy boyfriends are imperiled, including Laurie’s granddaughter (Andi Matichak). But the body count is respectable, if unremarkable, by today’s standards: The original “Halloween” was never about volume.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018Perhaps pandering to viewers who these days expect a higher yuck factor, this new iteration is more gruesome yet much less scary, its sleekness and efficiency poor substitutes for foreboding. Sorely missing are Carpenter’s moderation and patience, the restraint that turned simple shots of a darkened stairway and a hushed, leaf-lined street into dread-filled spaces. His Michael was both man and myth, particular and universal, psychopath and supernatural entity. There’s a reason he also appears in the credits as the Shape.By sending Michael forth to perform his greatest hits — like back-seat lurking and unexpectedly sitting up — Green reduces a character who was the ultimate mystery to an audience-prompting device that feels as worn as his perfectly aged mask. Though I suppose when you’re a mere knife-blade away from collecting Social Security, no one can blame you for looking a wee bit tired."

Written and directed by Jonah Hill, this film wants to be less a period piece than a time capsule, an immersion in the sights and sound of a pop-cultural moment.And even, almost, the smells. After Stevie (Sunny Suljic) smokes his first mentholated cigarette, he darts into a gas station men’s room on his way home, chugs some liquid soap straight from the bottle and fumigates his clothes with a cloud of air freshener. Stevie, whose coming-of-age story this is, lives with his brooding, violent-tempered older brother, Ian (Lucas Hedges), and their beleaguered single mom, Dabney (Katherine Waterston), in a modest house in Los Angeles. He’s a small guy, on the cusp of puberty, with wide blue eyes and a smile that undercuts his determined efforts to seem tough.At first, Stevie worships Ian, whose interests are hip-hop, street fashion and orange juice. Ian returns his younger brother’s admiration with sullen silence or brutality — the first shot of the film is of a beating that leaves a nasty bruise on Stevie’s chest. Soon enough, he finds new idols among a group of bigger kids who hang out at a skateboard shop, and he makes it his project to fit in with them.“Mid90s” winds its loose, episodic way through their rituals and routines as they skate, smoke, chase girls and talk nonsense. Stevie acquires a nickname — Sunburn, in honor of a half-clever joke he manages to blurt out during his informal initiation — and racks up rites of passage. First cigarette, first kiss, first “time in a car without someone’s parents.” It’s sweet, but also raw. There’s an undercurrent of danger and desperation in his new crowd, and you might find yourself worrying about Stevie even as you revel, vicariously, in his newfound pleasures.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 9, 2018Like its hero, “Mid90s” struggles to figure out what it wants to be, and the struggle makes it interesting as well as occasionally frustrating. Hill, working with the cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt, the production designer Jahmin Assa and the composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, aims for maximum authenticity of look, sound and language. The frame is boxy, the visual texture filmy and rough (it was shot on super 16 millimeter), the musical cues impeccably curated and the dialogue full of casual racism, misogyny and homophobia.Viewers who were around back then might remember Larry Clark’s “Kids” and other prurient, ostensibly cautionary tales of adolescent misbehavior. Hill’s sensibility is not so harsh, though — he’s a late 2010s guy at heart — and he filters some potentially ugly stuff through Stevie’s trusting, innocent eyes.The movie’s truest insights have to do with the hierarchies and rivalries within his new friendship group. Stevie is brought in by Ruben (Gio Galicia), who seems eager to have someone under him in the pecking order. He dispenses dubious wisdom along with smokes, and sells Stevie his old skateboard. But as the newbie starts to come out from under his mentor’s wing, Ruben gets jealous.There is also friction at the top. Ray (Na-kel Smith), the most talented skater and the leader of the pack, has ambitions beyond hanging out and getting high. This puts him in conflict with his sidekick (Olan Prenatt), a laid-back dude from a relatively privileged background whose nickname can’t be repeated here. Best friends since early childhood, the two are increasingly at odds in ways that threaten the harmonious vibes that hold the crew together. (The fifth member, known as Fourth Grade and played by Ryder McLaughlin, is the designated verbal punching bag and videographer.)For his part, Stevie might turn into a jerk or hold on to his openhearted, decent qualities. Beneath its posturing and profanity, “Mid90s” has some after-school special in its DNA, which I don’t mean as a knock. It’s a movie about making choices in tough circumstances, and for the most part Hill makes pretty good ones."

She would most likely feel the same way about you, minus the “interesting” part, unless you happen to be a cat or Dorothy Parker. It has been a while since a world-class, life-size misanthrope like Lee has commanded the screen — not another brooding narcissist or a showily difficult cable TV antihero, but a smart, cranky human recognizably made of flesh and blood. Also whiskey, bile and typewriter ink.There was a real Lee Israel, a writer turned literary forger who died in 2014. In “Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” based on Israel’s memoir of the same name, she’s played by Melissa McCarthy, in a performance that more than atones for “Life of the Party” and “The Happytime Murders.” Though McCarthy has played abrasive and obnoxious comic characters in the past — it’s one of her specialties — Lee is a 3-D grouch of a whole different order.[Read our profile of Melissa McCarthy (it might cheer you up).]Early in the film, she treks across Manhattan from her place on West 82nd Street to a literary party at her agent’s apartment, which is much nicer than her own. Lee makes the rounds, sneering and muttering into her double Scotch; spars with the agent, whose name is Marjorie; and leaves with a few partial rolls of pilfered toilet paper, a napkin full of boiled shrimp (to be shared with her cat, Jersey) and someone else’s overcoat.It’s 1991, and Lee, the author of several popular biographies of bygone celebrities, finds herself in career limbo — or possibly professional free fall. It’s too early to blame her woes on the internet, as future writers will. For reasons that Marjorie (Jane Curtin) is a little too eager to explain, Lee’s proposed life of the great vaudevillian Fanny Brice is a non-starter. An earlier book about Estée Lauder is for sale at a humiliating discount in a used bookstore. The rent is overdue. There’s no money to pay Jersey’s veterinary bills. A life of crime beckons.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018What Lee falls into is no ordinary criminal enterprise, and her eventual accomplice is not a typical underworld minion. For a time, the only nonfeline companion Lee can tolerate is Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant), a bon vivant of infinite charm, no fixed address and ambiguous professional bona fides. If Lee is a rent-stabilized Dorothy Parker, Jack is a couch-crashing Oscar Wilde — utterly ignorant of literature but naturally witty and great fun to be around. He’s game for anything, including serial fraud.The scam arises by accident. Lee stumbles across — O.K., steals — a Fanny Brice letter and discovers that there’s a modestly remunerative market for that kind of memorabilia in the city’s used bookstores. The problem is that the letters for sale are often boring, perfunctory notes valued mainly for the famous signature. Lee sets out to improve the epistolary record (and increase the asking price) by fabricating dazzling missives from the likes of Parker, Lillian Hellman and Noël Coward. (The film’s title is a priceless bit of faux Parker.) It’s an elaborate grift, but also, she begins to feel, a literary art form in its own right.“Can You Ever Forgive Me?,” directed by Marielle Heller (“The Diary of a Teenage Girl”), is catnip for the bookish. It will also appeal to anyone with nostalgia for a generally underappreciated era in New York history, when the high glamour felt a little scuffed, the urban apocalypse had been postponed, and Manhattan abounded in bookstores and scruffy gay bars. Enough of these are still around — including Argosy Book Store on East 59th and Julius’ on West 10th — to provide the film with locations and an atmosphere of lived-in cosmopolitan bohemianism. There were no Starbucks or co-working spaces back then. A person could breathe, and read.Partly because the movie is so splendidly and completely absorbed in its characters and their milieu, it communicates much more than a quirky appreciation for old books and odd readers. Ms. Heller and the screenwriters, Jeff Whitty and the great Nicole Holofcener, resist the impulse to moralize about Lee’s misdeeds or to sand down her rough edges. Like “The Diary of a Teenage Girl,” which handled disturbing material with grace and good humor, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” is neither judgy nor ethically neutral. Lee and Jack can be gleefully amoral, and will go to great lengths to justify their actions, but they don’t entirely lack conscience or decency.In what is perhaps a violation of the con artist’s code, Lee befriends one of her marks, a bookseller named Anna (Dolly Wells). Anna is both a fan and a gentle kindred spirit, at least as far as literary taste is concerned, and the possibility of romance flickers between them. (The fact that Jack and Lee are gay is both crucially important and no big deal.) It’s painful to watch Lee’s instinctive recoil from the possibility of intimacy, but her stubborn aloneness is also a kind of integrity. The last thing we could ever do is feel sorry for her.Which brings me back to where I started. Lee is interesting because she is so entirely herself, even as she makes her living pretending to be other people. The writers she impersonates survive because of their outsize individuality, a quality of brazen inventiveness that she is able to counterfeit because she shares it. Of course there’s only one Dorothy Parker. It might also be said — Lee Israel herself might have said, in her own voice or Parker’s — that it takes one to know one."

One involves the city’s residents, like Clayton Guyton, or Mr. C., a former correctional officer who runs an East Baltimore community center and works to reduce violence on his block.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018The other track involves the city apparatus, including Monique Brown, a longtime police officer who says that when she joined the force, friends said they wouldn’t talk to her, and a young councilman, Brandon M. Scott. He makes the case that Baltimore has focused too narrowly on policing instead of addressing education, employment and health.It’s become de rigueur to compare Baltimore movies to “The Wire,” but it’s an unavoidable reference point here, not least for the scene in which an officer ventures inside a vacant house that’s become a drug den or because we see a bit of Dante Barksdale, an anti-violence outreach coordinator whose uncle was said to be an inspiration for characters in the HBO series.The film captures up close the way violence transforms neighborhoods and families with an immediacy that transcends headlines or sensationalism."

We don’t talk about blues artists that much today. Like jazz and folk, it is, in its ostensibly pure form, appreciated in small corners by enthusiasts.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018I have to remind myself of these things whenever I hear an artist like Paul Butterfield, the blues singer and harmonica player who was prominent in the ’60s and ’70s. He died in 1987 at 44 of an accidental overdose. As one of the interview subjects in “Horn From the Heart: The Paul Butterfield Story” puts it, just three notes from Butterfield’s harp were enough to establish a groove, or vastly improve an existing one.John Anderson, who directs this documentary, does a brisk job of explaining the milieu in which Butterfield learned his craft. As a youngster in Chicago he took classical flute lessons but was drawn to the city’s blues clubs. Butterfield answered the question, “Can a white man play the blues?” not just with his own excellence but with his dedication to racial equality as a bandleader. “I’m not bragging but I didn’t see nobody else who was better,” says Sam Lay, one of the earliest African-American drummers for the first Butterfield Blues Band. “And we happened to be black and white.”In terms of production values, this is not a snazzy film. But the interview footage with family and colleagues, including Bonnie Raitt and Elvin Bishop, an early Butterfield guitarist, is smart and thorough. While the last third of Butterfield’s life is tragic, spending the better part of 90 minutes with the man and his music is exhilarating. The picture may get at least a few people talking about him again."

The words, unattributed in the film and the source of its title, come from “Lady Windermere’s Fan” by Oscar Wilde, where they supply the definition of a cynic. But while this colorful and inquisitive cinematic essay on the state of the art world is occasionally skeptical and consistently thoughtful, cynicism isn’t really on its agenda.Rather than lament the pervasive influence of money on contemporary art, “The Price of Everything” examines the relationship between commerce and aesthetics from different angles. “You can’t have a golden age without gold,” someone says, and by that standard we are currently in an epoch of platinum. The sale and resale of work by living and recently dead artists is a multibillion-dollar market, which bothers some people more than others.An affable presence just outside of camera range (and the director of “My Architect,” about his father, Louis Kahn), the filmmaker chats with curators and critics, painters and auction-house executives — an impressive cross-section of players with differing stakes in the game. Since all of them do have a stake, none are interested in outright derision or dismissal. There may be arguments over the quality of the bathwater, but everyone agrees that the baby needs protection.Buying and selling occupy a large part of “The Price of Everything” — the phrase “the art of the deal” is uttered at one point without evident irony — but creation also receives a share of attention. We watch George Condo and Marilyn Minter at work, approaching the human figure in radically different ways. We also visit with the voluble Jeff Koons, who is supervising a workshop where technicians produce stroke-by-stroke replicas of well-known masterpieces.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018Koons is by some calculations — not all of them strictly monetary — the most successful artist of our time, a consummate self-marketer who brazenly celebrates the commodification of art. It would be easy enough for Kahn to treat him as a villain, but instead he suggest a witty comparison between Koons and an artist whose last name happens to rhyme with his.Larry Poons lives in a peeling clapboard farmhouse far from Sotheby’s. A star in the ’60s and ’70s, he has fallen out of fashion but has continued to paint, indifferent to trends and less bitter than you might expect. As Koons unveils a partnership with Louis Vuitton, Poons plans a comeback exhibition at Yares Art, an old-fashioned gallery show of colorful, large-scale abstract canvases.At roughly the same time, Sotheby’s is preparing to auction a collection of paintings that includes work by Condo, Gerhard Richter, Willem de Kooning and other blue-chip names. It also includes a painting by Njideka Akunyili Crosby, a Los Angeles-based, Nigerian-born artist whose reputation is growing. Her presence, like Poons’s, presents an implicit argument against the cynical view that money and celebrity have corrupted hard work and aesthetic value. Even so, the sums commanded by the de Koonings and the Richters are staggering, and their disappearance into private collections feels like a blow to the idea of a democratic culture.Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic for New York magazine, regrets that he is unlikely to see the auctioned-off work again in his lifetime. “I’m sad to be saying goodbye,” he says. Equal parts gadfly and cheerleader, Saltz is the playful conscience of “The Price of Everything,” a role he can play partly because he has no money on the table. But if the artists are the heroes, the auctioneers, collectors and dealers aren’t exactly the villains. Their acquisitiveness might be an expression of love.And they are critics and philosophers of a kind, puzzling over old and stubborn questions. What makes a work of art great? Where does its value come from? Why do we care — as a species and a civilization — about this stuff? According to a figure cited in “The Price of Everything,” those are $56 billion questions. Even at a fraction of that price, they would be just as difficult to answer."

The documentary “Impulso,” directed by Emilio Belmonte, follows Molina, who has been credited as one of flamenco’s rising stars for combining traditions with improvisations and other experiments, as she prepares for a show in Paris.The movie’s challenge is to bottle her spontaneity, which is clearly thrilling to behold in person but less dynamic in a medium that requires every move to be selected in advance, without the suspenseful bond that an artist shares with a live audience. Belmonte gets caught between two modes of nonfiction filmmaking.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 8, 2018Part of “Impulso” is a demystification of the artistic process, in which Molina and her collaborators resort to generalities to explain their essentially intuitive choices. The other part is a performance film. At the beginning, Molina describes a flamenco dancer as an instrument, and the sound is the movie’s best aspect. But while the percussive rhythms guarantee that moviegoers will tap their toes, only a few moments, such as when Molina crawls over rocks at the Centre Pompidou Málaga, yield eye-catching images.The Paris performance, Caída del Cielo, presented in excerpts without much preparation on what to look for, feels like an anticlimax. The most vital moment in “Impulso” comes earlier, when Molina makes a joint appearance with the flamenco luminary Antonia Santiago Amador, known as La Chana, whose whole body seems to convulse with a passion “Impulso” otherwise rarely conveys."

SCOTT","Review: ‘Watergate’ Shocks Anew With Its True Tale of Political Scandal","Charles Ferguson delivers a comprehensive documentary about the not-so-distant past, with its eye very much on the present.","2018-10-11","2018-10-12","2018-10-19 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/movies/watergate-review-documentary.html,Read the New York Times Review of Watergate,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/12/arts/12watergate/12watergate-mediumThreeByTwo210-v3.jpg,210,140,"The word “bombshell” pops up a lot in “Watergate,” Charles Ferguson’s comprehensive documentary about … well, you know. From the summer of 1972, when five men were arrested breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, until President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation two years later, the public was confronted with a barrage of shocking revelations. The morning papers and the evening news brought fresh reports of wrongdoing at the highest levels of government, unearthed by congressional committees, a federal grand jury and the diggings of journalists. Before the nation’s eyes, a “third-rate burglary” blossomed into a constitutional crisis.Ferguson has given his film the subtitle “How We Learned to Stop an Out-of-Control President.” In case the implications of the lesson weren’t clear, he ends with George Santayana’s well-worn aphorism about those who don’t study the past being doomed to repeat it. Whether we are living through a sequel to Watergate — or whether out-of-control presidents after Nixon might have learned to get away with their own crimes — is in some ways an idle question. History rarely repeats itself exactly. The lessons of “Watergate” have to do with the fragility and resilience of democratic institutions, and with the stark ethical challenges that sometimes arise in political life.Serious stuff. But the movie — more than four hours long, split into two parts with a cliffhanger in the middle — also works, perhaps unexpectedly, as escapist entertainment. Like many of my fellow citizens, I spend a lot of time thinking about the current president, whether I want to or not. He’s ubiquitous on television, in social media, and as a topic of dinner-party discourse and water-cooler hobnobbing. For the entirety of “Watergate,” however, I didn’t think about Donald J. Trump at all. I thought about Richard Nixon instead, which while not exactly pleasant was at least different.Ferguson’s narrative is so dense and complicated, and at the same time so dramatic, suspenseful and clear, that it absorbs all of your attention. You probably know the outcome, and if you’re a history-nerd child of the ’70s like me, you’re probably familiar with many of the names and details. Haldeman. Ehrlichman. Kalmbach. Segretti. Sam Ervin. The Saturday Night Massacre. “I am not a crook.” It’s like a classic rock station on satellite radio. (The movie also has some fine musical cues of its own.)Or maybe a deluxe remastered edition of an album you’ve left sitting in the back of a milk crate. Almost literally: Ferguson makes ingenious use of the tapes that play such a large role in Watergate lore. He films re-enactments that are more like staged readings, in which actors playing Nixon (Douglas Hodge) and members of his staff reproduce conversations captured by a hidden audio recorder. The point is not to embellish the record but to clarify it.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 10, 2018All the dialogue is verbatim, and its meaning registers with startling force. The president of the United States rants about Jews, plots against his perceived enemies in the press, and conspires to obstruct justice and undermine law and order in more ways than you can count. From a relatively safe historical distance, it’s possible to appreciate him as an almost literary character, a volatile and fascinating mixture of resentment, intelligence, paranoia and guile, with a disarming sentimental streak. No wonder so many fine actors (including Sir Anthony Hopkins, Philip Baker Hall and Dan Hedaya) have relished the opportunity to play him.But though Nixon is of course at the center of “Watergate,” it’s very much an ensemble piece, a real-life pageant of the high theater of the state. Much of the drama took place before the television cameras — news conferences and live coverage of hearings, as well as bulletins from the likes of Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor and Frank Reynolds on the networks — and Ferguson makes brilliant use of the archival record.He supplements galvanic television footage with lively interviews with survivors, including the former representatives Pete McCloskey and Elizabeth Holtzman, lawyers from the special prosecutor’s office and members of the Nixon administration. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein too, of course, and also Dan Rather and Lesley Stahl, then both at CBS News.Collectively, they tell a story that is part political thriller and part courtroom drama, with moments of Shakespearean grandeur and swerves into stumblebum comedy. You can watch “Watergate” relishing the craziness of a bygone era and marveling at the styles of elocution, barbering and haberdashery that prevailed in that mad time, but the gravity of the tale is inescapable.Ferguson is a forensic specialist in recent historical disaster — his earlier films are about the Iraq War (“No End in Sight”) and the 2008 financial crisis (“Inside Job”) — and he sticks close to the factual record. “Slow Burn,” the recent Slate podcast on Watergate, examines the same material from a wider, more interpretive perspective. “Watergate” scrutinizes individual motives and actions, suggesting that history can turn on the choices people make: to lie or tell the truth; to face reality or hide behind the veil of ideology; to swear loyalty to principle or to power.The lesson shouldn’t be that difficult."

It’s directed by and co-stars Mathieu Amalric; the actress in the title role, sort of, is Jeanne Balibar; Mr. Amalric and Ms. Balibar were once married. The “sort of” is because Ms. Balibar doesn’t play the title role as such. She plays an actress named Brigitte, who’s playing the real-life French singer Monique Serf, who went by the stage name Barbara, in a film directed by Yves, the character played by Mr. Amalric.Barbara, a contemporary of Jacques Brel, was a chanteuse who specialized, as is the French custom, in songs of lost love. She was hugely popular in her country — one of her records is reputed to have sold a million copies in the 12 hours after its release — and all but unknown in the United States. She died in 1997 at 67.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018I’m making this film sound like a potentially difficult sit. It’s not, at all. Mr. Amalric’s film has a fragmented style, depicting the shooting of various sequences in the fictional Barbara biopic, and some personal excursions of Brigitte’s, including an amorous road trip with a hunky prop man.It’s a film of scenes rather than of one unified narrative, but each scene is a showcase for the magnificent talents of Ms. Balibar, a multifaceted performer of spectacular magnetism and intelligence. Stalking a hotel room wearing only fishnet stockings and a blouse, she’s a cat on the prowl for something she can’t quite put her paw on; sitting at a piano and belting out one of Barbara’s songs, she’s the queen of French soul.Mr. Amalric plays Yves as a still-besotted fan of Barbara, and as a director he’s a still-besotted fan of Ms. Balibar’s. He is wise in his enthusiasms."

Her contortions are mesmerizing, and for a moment we relax in expectation that “Over the Limit” will be a rather soothing sports documentary. Minutes later, however, we realize that what we are watching is a real-life horror movie.“Why do we need her? She’s not a fighter!” The harsh voice, swollen with disgust, belongs to the head of the Russian team, Irina Viner-Usmanova, a perfect villain in thick makeup and scary hats. Mamun, anxiously training for the 2016 Olympics while coping with a foot injury and her father’s cancer diagnosis, is pale and silent. Yet the verbal abuse continues, relentless and sometimes vicious, a harrowing psychological barrage that fills the movie and batters the ears.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018Reports of excessively punitive training of female gymnasts surface with some regularity, so in that sense “Over the Limit” is not unexpected. But the Polish director Marta Prus, brilliantly constructing a very particular look at a sport in which the arch of an eyebrow is as important as that of a spine, remains coolly impassive. Rather than shape an angry exposé, Prus, herself a former gymnast, recognizes and embraces the Cinderella-like appeal of Mamun’s punishing journey. By the end of the movie’s brief 74 minutes, this resilient young woman seems shockingly untraumatized; the audience might not be so lucky."

In “The Kindergarten Teacher,” a riveting remake of Nadav Lapid’s 2015 Israeli drama of the same name, she plays Lisa, a Staten Island kindergarten teacher in her 40s whose serene existence hides a gnawing hunger for a life filled with art and literature.An evening poetry-writing class only reveals her own mediocre talent, no matter how encouraging her charming instructor (Gael García Bernal). Her husband (Michael Chernus) is supportive but floored by her frustration, her teenage children buried in their own screens and schedules. Then, one day, a little boy in her class delivers, trance-like, a few lines of startlingly evocative verse. Believing him a prodigy — an awareness of the difference between poets and pretenders is both her gift and her curse — Lisa scribbles down his words as if delivered by a seer.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018CreditCreditNetflixFluidly capturing the trajectory of a ruinous obsession, the writer and director, Sara Colangelo, skillfully fudges the line between mentoring and manipulation, and between nurturing talent and appropriating it. Suffusing each scene with an insinuating, prickly tension, she remains ruthlessly committed to her screw-tightening tone, offering the viewer no comforting moral escape hatch.And oh, do we need one, as Gyllenhaal — who is never out of our sight — somehow makes us all her accomplices, imprisoning our sympathies even when Lisa’s inappropriate behavior escalates to inexcusable. As she did so potently in Hugo Blick’s marvelous 2014 mini-series, “The Honorable Woman,” Gyllenhaal forces us to search her face for clues to motives left purposely unarticulated. “How far will she go?” we wonder, even as we fear that we already know the answer."

Characters toss off lines like “I’ve never read the Borges book this quote is from” and “It’s actually the most comprehensive book about the freeway revolt in Philadelphia that I’ve read.” Such insights and humblebrags are the bulk of the dialogue. The title evokes the musical era that preceded Romanticism, and this highly original movie has been denatured of romance or even obvious dramatic incident.The film is organized around a group that meets to discuss “The Divine Comedy.” The most enthusiastic participant is Cal (Calvin Engime), who speaks authoritatively on the original Italian and just about everything else. (In the wittiest set piece, a lengthy single take, he delivers a comically off-the-cuff history of the English Reformation martyr Edmund Campion.)“Classical Period” is often very funny, but it’s also poignant, imagining a milieu — part heaven, part purgatory — in which daily lives can be devoted to pondering the aggregated wisdom of the past. There are also hints of a plot, as the seasons progress and Evelyn (Evelyn Emile), another member of the group, expresses irritation at Cal’s smugness.Fendt finds beauty in delicately shaded shots of reading and translating. (The movie was shot on 16-millmeter, and the texture — itself the stuff of libraries and archives — seems essential to the experience.) In looking to the past, “Classical Period” finds something new."

This is hardly news. As the title suggests, El Royale — a motor lodge with pretensions of grandeur, which seems like an apt metaphor for this movie — isn’t a place for a good night’s sleep. It’s a spot for intrigue, desperation, swinging tunes and bloodletting. Mostly, it is a wellspring for a lot of talk, both seemingly idle chatter and carefully obfuscating oratories. Words are never casually exchanged at the Royale here but are instead deployed like weapons in what soon resembles a war of all against all.These many words have flowed from Drew Goddard, a screenwriter whose high-profile credits include “The Martian” and who made his directing debut with the self-knowing horror movie “The Cabin in the Woods.” He also directed “Bad Times” and imbued it with a similar self-consciousness, an attitude that has become almost a default in genre movies. Like many contemporary filmmakers who take on established cinematic forms, Goddard wants to play inside the frame and also to put his individuality on the picture. Optimistically set at the intersection of Agatha Christie and Quentin Tarantino, “Bad Times” is a hard-boiled thriller with flashes of a horror but largely a statement of authorial intent.The movie starts off on an ominous note that soon turns faintly comic after a solitary man (Nick Offerman) enters a motel room that, partly because of the frontal presentation, resembles a stage. A study in midcentury drab, the room is clean, borderline austere, meticulously arranged and one flickering light bulb away from David Lynch-style uneasiness. The man’s fedora and the silhouette of his clothing suggest that it’s the 1950s. He soon doffs his hat and begins moving the room’s furnishings to expose the wooden floor, which he then methodically tears up. One of the few silent characters in the movie, he doesn’t say a word; and then, in a flash, he’s dead.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018The story proper begins a decade later, circa 1969, now swathed in the mystery of the first man’s death. (The clothing and some television footage of Richard M. Nixon roughly indicate the period change.) The Royale no longer attracts the high rollers and big names it once did; all that remains of its once-glittering past are the framed celebrity photos hanging on a wall. The joint appears deserted, like an abandoned film set. Even after some guests start dribbling in, there’s a sense that something has been lost, a feeling that — as the blood spills — suggests that Goddard is teasing an idea, perhaps something about the shift from the 1950s to the ’60s.And maybe he is, though his attention is primarily invested in keeping things creepy, scary and off-kilter. In this, he gets a lot of support from his very fine actors, who each get a big moment (sometimes more) and reams of dialogue. They enter — stage left, stage right — a smiling, yammering, disparate group that seems like the windup to an elaborate joke: a salesman (Jon Hamm) walks into a motel with a priest (a soulful Jeff Bridges) and a singer (Cynthia Erivo). Over time, these three are joined by the motel’s manager (Lewis Pullman), a hippie (Dakota Johnson), a kidnapping victim (Cailee Spaeny) and a menace (Chris Hemsworth, having demonstrable fun).Goddard spends quite a bit of time putting these characters, all vague archetypes, into position. They smile and exchange small talk, initially moving in the cavernous entryway like plotted geometric points. One side of the Royale is in California, the other in Nevada, and a bold red line runs through the motel, dividing it into near-mirrored halves. The characters too are carefully divided between their public and private selves. They all have secrets, some benign and others dangerous, even lethal. Like veteran gamblers, they at first hold their cards close to the chest, keeping them from both the other guests and the audience until the bad times arrive, just as promised.For a while, the performances and the visual style keep you easily engaged, as does the pileup of secrets. Every character has his or her reasons, naturally, and each pulls you into another mystery. One has a hidden stash of cash, while another carries a badge. The secrets often tumble out after the characters check into their rooms amid the jump cuts, flashbacks and cinephile allusions (Kubrick’s “The Killing,” etc.). Goddard keeps everything smoothly, ebbing and flowing as the characters separate and join together, but at some point during this logy 2-hour-and-21-minute exercise you want something more substantial than even Hemsworth’s admittedly mesmerizing snaky hips."

More than anything, David wants him back.ImageTimothée Chalamet, left, and Steve Carell star in “Beautiful Boy,” a film adaptation of father-and-son addiction memoirs.CreditFrancois Duhamel/Amazon Studios“Beautiful Boy,” directed by Felix Van Groeningen (“The Broken Circle Breakdown”) is based on paired memoirs by the real David and Nic Sheff, who are played onscreen by Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet. The film tilts a bit more toward the parental perspective, emphasizing David’s pain and bafflement. But it also incorporates some of his son’s literary sensibility, and conveys the bliss of being high along with the desperation of dependency. We don’t really learn why Nic became addicted, but we do get a sense of what it was like for him and his family to struggle with his disease.Stories like this tend to vary in setting and details, but also to conform to a certain pattern. Van Groeningen, who wrote the script with Luke Davies, arranges the narrative in chronological curlicues, looping back and forth in time and relying heavily on extended, music-driven montages. The digressions and flashbacks rest on a familiar sequence: a crisis is followed by an attempt at sobriety and, usually, a relapse.The governing moods are grief, guilt, anxiety and what David calls “psychological terror.” Nic is skilled at lying and emotional manipulation. He cannibalizes love and undermines trust, and allows glimmers of his smart, charming self to peak through at strategic moments. David swerves from denial to guarded optimism to exasperation, veering into rage and despair. His wife, Karen (Maura Tierney), Nic’s stepmother, tries to be supportive. Nic’s mother, Vicki (Amy Ryan), who lives in Los Angeles, does what she can to help, though she and David often find themselves quarreling about what to do and who is at fault.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018It is hard not to be touched by the testing of paternal love, or by Nic’s fragility. But “Beautiful Boy,” rather than plumbing the hard emotional depths of its subject, skates on a surface of sentiment and gauzy visual beauty. There is a lot of good music — John Lennon, Sigur Ros, Perry Como — and California vistas so gorgeous that you might wonder if the state’s tourist board had a role in the production. (The cinematographer is Ruben Impens.) But the picturesqueness and the flowing, music-video rhythms of the editing give the film a slick, evasive feel, as if it were too cautious or too cool to confront the worst of what it’s about.The main performances are similarly coy, as if the actors were protecting the characters from our scrutiny rather than opening them up. Neither Carell nor Chalamet risks losing the audience’s sympathy, which means that neither one fully earns it. The movie almost defensively insists on propositions we had no reason to doubt. Nic is a good kid. David is a good dad. Meth is a terrible, seductive drug.“Beautiful Boy” is not a bad movie. It was made with earnest care and honorable intentions, and concludes with a recitation of one of Charles Bukowski’s best poems. But as much as it may want to illuminate the realities of addiction, it mystifies David and Nic’s experiences, leaving too many questions — how and what as well as why — swirling in the air."

In an America of the not too distant future, an unnamed president, in the ostensible name of national security, proposes that citizens sign a “voluntary” oath that begins, “I pledge my loyalty to my president.” Those who opt in will get a nice tax credit, while those who don’t … well, they’re assured that nothing untoward will occur.Mr. Barinholtz’s Chris is married to Tiffany Haddish’s Kai, and they have an adorable daughter around whom they try, and fail, to avoid swearing. They are, in some respects, typical liberals in a typical suburban enclave, or bubble, or what have you. Chris, while outraged over the oath, at first doesn’t see it really catching on in the Land of the Free.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018Then Thanksgiving weekend rolls around — and with it, the deadline for signing. The pot of opposing opinions is stirred by Chris and reactionary members of his extended family. The script drops right-wing maxims (“facts don’t care about your feelings”) and does a lot of digital-age box-checking (Twitter followers and Instagram feeds are mentioned). Things turn dark and irrevocably ham-handed when a couple of men from an oath-supporting citizens group — a kind of paramilitary organization in disguise — show up.A fixture in the worlds of stage and television comedy, Mr. Barinholtz has enough cachet to assemble an excellent cast, although he’s not as canny about using it. Ms. Haddish, for instance, is largely obliged to place her comedic light under wraps to play a peacemaker while the characters around her freak out.It was said by many after the 2016 election that the Trump administration would yield great satirical art. This is not an example of that."

Often, the exceptional cast saves the project from exhaustion.Rashad is a loose cannon, intense enough to blast you apart yet tender enough to help patch you back together. It’s a powerhouse performance. Goldberg is exasperating in just the right ways as a bleeding heart whose capacity for forgiveness seems maddeningly endless.“Bikini Moon” is better in separate scenes than as a whole, where Manchevski’s overreaches and plot lapses become more glaring.

But despite the characters’ screams, their scares are rarely filmed in a way that might give the audience pleasure. In spite of its spooky source material, the movie is more of a family fantasy than a thriller. If children once stole the original “Goosebumps” books from libraries to hide the source of their nightmares from their parents, “Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween” feels slightly supervisory — a movie to leave playing in the background of a child’s birthday party.The movie is not all medicine with no sugar. Most of the set-piece sequences use extensive computer-generated imagery, but the director, Ari Sandel, also makes room for practical effects and real-life set dressing in his depiction of possessed Wardenclyffe. Giant spiders made from balloons dwarf whole homes, headless horsemen haunt lawns. The production design displays a genuine enthusiasm for the decorative kitsch of the Halloween season, and the flashes of giddy craftiness beneath the slick style almost compensate for the toothlessness of the horror."

Police arrived and found a stockpile of cocaine inside. Cindy was released by the authorities and soon began a different kind of life: She married another man, Adam, and had three daughters.Some six years later, Cindy was arrested, tried and convicted on conspiracy charges from that 2002 drug find.

The emotions run still deeper at the end, when some surprises unfold.As a family member, Valdez had rare access to those he filmed. But that closeness often leads him to omit or skim over vital details — particulars of the crime are frustratingly scarce, as are specifics on the sentencing laws that are denounced here.Those oversights are significant.

One other mouth, actually: that of his father, played by Harris Yulin, a dyspeptic fellow who, years back, groomed his son for a career in the majors, then messed it up for him in a tragic, catastrophic fashion.This back story is a bit familiar; less so is John’s innovation to take bets on youth baseball games, which turns into a temporary payday. At the same time, he gives pitching and life lessons to the son of a former high school fling, played by Pamela Adlon.Hyams directs Timothy Brady’s script appropriately if not brilliantly (Hyams is also credited as a co-editor), but the movie’s main attraction, finally, is its cast.

Their matching tattoos, in fact, mark the spot where Elliot receives shots to treat Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare type of cancer that typically strikes young people.For their debut feature-length film, the writers and directors, Hannah Marks and Joey Power, repeatedly use montages to depict Elliot and Mia’s relationship, presenting snapshots of an affair as it rushes through stages and milestones, adopting a rhythm that outpaces even Elliot’s cancer. Elliot and Mia fall in love in a fever, and just as quickly they fall apart.As a cancer drama, “After Everything” is refreshingly mundane, focusing less on the high stakes of illness than on how two young people talk to each other in sickness and in health. Its matter-of-fact tone is carried through to all of its lived-in performances, including welcome cameos by Marisa Tomei and Gina Gershon. But the film’s successes rest largely on its lead actors. White and Monroe demonstrate natural chemistry, and they discretely suggest the private experiences of their characters, the youthful doubts that can’t be extinguished by passion.

Kennedy earlier in the decade. In effect writing the check that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins would cash a half-dozen years after his death, Kennedy vowed to send astronauts to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard.A clip of that speech appears near the end of “First Man,” Damien Chazelle’s sweeping and intimate new film, which takes the conquest of difficulty as both theme and inspiration. Retelling the story of the American space program from the early ’60s to the Apollo 11 mission through the lens of Armstrong’s professional and personal life, Chazelle (drawing on James R. Hansen’s biography) unfurls a chronicle of setbacks, obstacles and tragedies on the way to eventual triumph.ImageRyan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, with Lukas Haas as Mike Collins, left, and Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin in “First Man.”CreditDaniel McFadden/Universal PicturesIt can be hard, almost 50 years later, to appreciate how many times, and in how many ways, the moon landing almost didn’t happen. Not only that: We might think we’ve seen it all before. “First Man,” its ending spoiled in advance, tries to restore a sense of uncertainty, of contingency, of the vast unknown that Armstrong and his colleagues faced. It also tries to find a fresh set of images (in IMAX, no less) to convey the strangeness and sublimity of those moments at Tranquility Base just after the “giant leap,” so we might intuit at least a glimmer of the awe that Armstrong must have felt.All of this is a daunting challenge — nowhere near as perilous or costly as Apollo itself, of course, but in its way a mirror of that undertaking. Chazelle is an ambitious filmmaker who makes films about ambition. His recent features constitute a kind of trilogy on the subject, each one larger in scale and grander in scope than the one before.[Readers tell us what they remember about the moon landing]“Whiplash,” “La La Land” and now “First Man” all concern a young or youngish man’s hunger for greatness, and suggest a developmental sequence, for both the archetypal character and for the director. The fledgling drummer played by Miles Teller in “Whiplash” (2014), defined by his aggressive competitiveness and his struggle with a demanding mentor, gives way, two years later, to the pianist (Ryan Gosling) in “La La Land” who navigates his own career in the context of a romantic partnership and professional rivalry with an equally driven artist (Emma Stone). Armstrong, a husband and father embedded in an organization that rewards both individual initiative and regimental discipline, completes the sequence.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018“First Man,” with Gosling as Armstrong (and a script by Josh Singer, who wrote “Spotlight” and “The Post”), is also the portrait of a career, as well as — a bravura act of careerism. I don’t mean that dismissively. Chazelle, already the youngest winner of an Oscar for directing, has always set his sights on the Hollywood mainstream. Like “La La Land,” which set out to re-energize the apparently antiquated genre of the musical, “First Man” is at once knowingly old-fashioned and shrewdly up-to-date.Its nostalgia — for a suburban, middle-class social order of crew-cut dads, stay-at-home moms, station wagons and cigarettes, and also for idealistic, robustly funded federal-government programs — is palpable. And yet Chazelle’s interest in Armstrong is as much personal as historical: bureaucratic snags, political-turf battles and engineering puzzles provide the narrative machinery, but feelings are the film’s fuel. Armstrong’s progress from pilot to celestial pioneer traces an epic arc, and like some of the ancient epics “First Man” is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center.His Penelope — loyal, anxious, angry, exhausted — is Janet (Claire Foy, trading in her plummy royal diction for flattened Midwestern vowels). She moves to Houston with her husband and their two young sons after Neil is accepted into the Gemini program. (The NASA people in the movie pronounce it Gemin-ee, not Gemin-eye.) Earlier, when he was at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the couple’s young daughter, Karen, died of a brain tumor, and “First Man” posits Neil and Janet’s grief as a kind of Rosebud, a half-buried center of emotional and psychological gravity, a source of motive and meaning.Karen’s is not the only death to be mourned. Janet sometimes seems to move through her days in anticipation of widowhood, and the progress of the Gemini and Apollo programs is measured partly in lives lost. Even for viewers versed in NASA history, who will know the fates of certain characters as soon as they are introduced, the deaths come as a shock. They are dramatized with cinematic tact, so that what you register is not horror but a sudden, disorienting absence, as if the men had vanished into space rather than crashing to earth or burning up on the launchpad.Neil, for all his competitive drive, is very much a team player, and the moon shot is a collective effort. “First Man” is more sports movie than science fiction, and not only because one of the mission commanders (Deke Slayton) is played by Kyle Chandler, forever Coach Taylor to “Friday Night Lights” fans. Slayton and Robert Gilruth (Ciaran Hinds) oversee a squad of rivals and comrades, showboats and role players, all of them contending with an invisible, formidable opposing team.The Russians! The Soviet Union had beaten the United States to every space-travel milestone, and NASA’s lunar program is like a fourth-quarter drive to score the winning touchdown. The natural quarterback seems to be Ed White (Jason Clarke), Neil’s closest friend. The wild card is Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), who shoots off his mouth and is more tolerated than beloved by his teammates. There are a scattering of wide-eyed rookies and wise veterans to round out the squad. (Shea Whigham, Christopher Abbott and Patrick Fugit stand out in a fine supporting cast.) The guys all work hard, drink beer together after hours and dwell in a Valhalla of tough-and-tender male camaraderie.ImageGosling’s Armstrong with his family, from left: Connor Blodgett, Claire Foy, as his wife, and Luke Winters.CreditDaniel McFadden/Universal PicturesNeil is a bit of an odd man out. The greatest challenge “First Man” confronts isn’t recreating spaceflight and the attendant technology — though the rattling din of ascent and the eerie quiet of zero-gravity are impressively rendered — but illuminating the inner life of a man who often behaved as if he were in possession of no such thing. It can be hard to tell if Neil possesses an extra-dry wit or if he’s just literal-minded. (When the astronauts are asked at a news conference what they’d like to bring to the moon with them, his answer is “more fuel.”) No one can guess how deep his still waters run — not his colleagues, not Janet, not their boys.His buttoned-up temperament, though, makes him a perfect representative of the paradox of space travel, a wildly poetic venture undertaken by men whose survival depended on the prose of memos and the music of calculus. Other movies about the American space program have featured cowboys, matinee idols and Boy Scouts — Sam Shepard’s Chuck Yeager and Ed Harris’s John Glenn in “The Right Stuff,” Tom Hanks’s Jim Lovell in “Apollo 13” — but this Neil Armstrong is a different archetype. He’s an egghead, and maybe also a bit of a cold fish.Gosling, underplaying with every fiber of his being, commits fully to the heroism of this conception of the character, but Chazelle doesn’t entirely trust it. Or rather, he lacks confidence that the audience will warm to such a man, and so he pipes in a layer of sentimentality that is effective without being fully convincing.From time to time, grumbling is heard about the point of it all — the actual Apollo program, that is, which gobbled up public money at a time of social unrest and military conflict. Chazelle inserts a performance of Gil Scott-Heron’s “Whitey on the Moon,” a bitterly satirical protest song that could have provided an alternative title for the movie. Such dissent is washed away by the sheer sublimity of the astronaut’s achievement as it is shared, via television, by tens of millions of people around the world. For a time, at least, people stopped asking about the point of it all. It was self-evident.“First Man” falls short of that kind of grandeur, though not for lack of trying. It gets almost everything right, but it’s also strangely underwhelming. It reminds you of an extraordinary feat and acquaints you with an interesting, enigmatic man. But there is a further leap beyond technical accomplishment — into meaning, history, metaphysics or the wilder zones of the imagination — that the film is too careful, too earthbound, to attempt."

Earlier that day, Breivik had parked a van crammed with about 2,000 pounds of explosives in front of a 17-story government building in central Oslo housing both the prime minister’s office and the Ministry of Justice. The bomb exploded, killing eight, while he was driving the 19 miles to a summer camp on Utoya Island run by the Labor Party. There, he slaughtered 69 additional people, most of them teenagers.Paul Greengrass’s latest, “22 July,” recreates the massacre and its aftermath. Fiction that hews close to fact, the movie is serious and meticulous, yet hollow. Best known for his contributions to the Bourne franchise, Greengrass also has a longstanding interest in terrorism, which he’s explored in movies as distinct as “United 93” and “Captain Phillips.” He brings his estimable skills to this new story, taking you through it, grim beat by beat. He introduces the characters, some soon to be dead, and restages the assault, the trial and the grief. Guns are discharged, tears shed, experts consulted, Breivik’s noxious views aired. All that is missing is a clear, motivating idea (political or otherwise).The movie opens on the day of the attack, and after some pro forma place setting — aerial shots of the lush countryside — quickly gets to the carnage. As is his wont, Greengrass employs a fast, kinetic approach and uses crosscutting to knit together assorted locations and characters, especially Breivik (Anders Danielsen Lie), who’s seen preparing for his mission, putting on a police uniform and hitting the road, all while crowds of smiling young people arrive on Utoya. Breivik’s lethal actions tie these and a few other places and faces together, including his watchful, distant mother (Hilde Olausson), and the prime minister (Ola G. Furuseth) and other government types.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 3, 2018Beginning with the assault carries some risks simply because it could turn you off right from the start. It also means that Breivik — his plan, inscrutable face and horrifying actions — immediately takes over the movie, making him its focus and most obvious reason for being. At the same time, because Greengrass frontloads the story in this manner, he doesn’t build to the massacre, an approach that might (as is too often the case) turn horror into the narrative climax. Instead, he gets the bloodshed out of the way, showing that his interest lies elsewhere, including on Viljar (Jonas Strand Gravli), an idealistic camper who’s repeatedly shot by Breivik.Written by Greengrass, the movie is based on the journalist Asne Seierstad’s 2013 book, “One of Us: The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway,” a movie-ready nonfiction account that reads like a page-turning thriller. Like “22 July,” the book is certainly unsettling, although, as its subtitle suggests, it also has ideas about Norway, not just documentation. Her portrait of Breivik is bleakly common: He had an unhappy childhood and spent a lot of time alone in his bedroom. There, he went from obsessively playing video games like World of Warcraft to scrolling through extremist sites that fulminated against women, Marxism and Islam, a correlation that Greengrass wisely avoids.In the movie, Breivik announces his beliefs (they’re too muddled to rise to the level of ideology, at least here) while he’s unloading his guns on Utoya, promising the campers — he calls them Marxists — that they’re going to die. After he is captured, he continues his vocal offensive, self-importantly calling himself a soldier in a larger political war involving the West and Islam. Best known for his sensitive performances in movies by Joachim Trier, including “Oslo, August 31,” Lie does what he can with a role that doesn’t call for much introspection. Even so, his is the most nuanced and convincing performance by far in the movie, which means that Breivik becomes the character we most want to see.Greengrass clearly wants to understand Breivik, to get at — much as Seierstad tries to do in her book — or even explain why someone like this exists, presumably as a political warning. And so, much like the trial lawyers, Greengrass gathers the evidence, sifts through the facts and pokes in shadowy, right-wing extremist corners. Still, the larger political and national picture remains blurry as the story jumps from the trial to scenes of governmental reckoning and Viljar’s long, hard recovery. And while the decision to consistently cut between Breivik and Viljar creates tension, it also means that victim and victimizer too often carry similar narrative weight, which is unfortunate."

Opening in 1897 as Wilde is sprung from a British prison after serving two years for gross indecency, the movie watches him wander, exiled and frequently penniless, through Dieppe and Naples before expiring in Paris of meningitis three years later. Brief flashbacks to the humiliations of his trial and the balm of opening-night adulation — represented by a sea of ecstatically applauding Victorian toffs — interrupt these peregrinations and underline the tragedy of his fall.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018As played (and written, and directed) by Rupert Everett, Wilde is less a sparkling wit than a sad, overweight sot, dependent on the kindness of strangers and the pity of old friends — and as much absinthe and cocaine as he can get his hands on. The locations change, but the desire for drugs and handsome young companions is constant, his knack for finding enablers well-honed. Surviving mainly on a small allowance from his estranged and sickly wife (a briefly seen Emily Watson), and the kindness of old friends like Robbie Ross (a fine Edwin Thomas), Wilde is partying more to numb the senses than excite them.Suffused with a sentimentality that Wilde himself would have deplored, “The Happy Prince” is narratively mushy and meandering. Yet, beneath the prosthetics, there’s genuine pathos in Mr. Everett’s portrayal of a man bitterly aware that his talents are unreliable armor against the perceived sin of his homosexuality. And when he sings a music-hall song to defuse a cafe riot, we see someone who has long used words to deflect violence and charm protectors.Scenes like this have a stand-alone power, infusing Wilde’s witticisms and clowning with tragic import and repositioning them as a bulwark against the hypocrisies of the age and the indignities of decline. An ill-advised reunion with Bosie Douglas (Colin Morgan), the selfish lover who caused his downfall, prompts Wilde to describe himself as “an old sheep with his butcher.” Like the sacrificial fairy-tale hero of the title, he’s a martyr to his self-destructive impulses, but Mr. Everett gives him a grandeur that prohibits pity. It’s a performance that far outshines his writing and direction, leaving the cinematographer John Conroy to pick up the slack with coppery, burnished images edged frequently in ominous shadow. In “The Happy Prince,” death is never far away, no matter how numerous Wilde’s “purple moments” in the sheets or drunken ditties in the cafe."

The movie, directed by Aaron and Amanda Kopp, follows a group of orphans at a home in Swaziland as they take part in a storytelling workshop.With the workshop leader, the writer and performer Gcina Mhlophe, focusing their instincts, the children devise a folk tale about a girl named Liyana who sets off, with a friendly bull, to rescue her brothers from thieves who have abducted and plan to sell them.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 2, 2018In addition to crocodiles, hyenas and a monster, many of the real-life hardships the children have witnessed or experienced — hunger, the prospect of trafficking, parental abuse and deaths from AIDS — work their way into the tale, presented in strikingly rendered animation from Shofela Coker, a Nigerian artist based in San Diego. “Liyana” crosscuts between the children telling the story and the otherwise-wordless animated sequences, which are more like illustrations in motion — brightly hued and textured, with the camera sometimes the only source of movement.“Liyana” includes warm scenes of Mhlophe’s class brainstorming, drawing and painting. The movie also shows the children going about their lives apart from the workshop. (We sit with one boy as he awaits the results of an H.I.V. test.) There are ways in which “Liyana” might seem to put too rosy a spin on its subject matter, but it shows the optimism and self-awareness that can come from creativity."

Michael is a disappointment to himself, to his cohort (Joanne Froggatt) and to his parents (Ed Harris and Amy Madigan).

Mr. White has cited the Coen brothers as inspirations, and it shows. Several quirky choices and offbeat moments dot the film, as does some bitter humor.While it’s tempting to wonder what a more noirish style might have produced, Mr. White’s approach pays off well enough here. He’s aided by Mr. Sommer’s boyish expressions, which barely disguise an oily ambition, and by Mr. Collins’s skill in boosting the tension.Mr. White smartly puts the plot first. Yet a few messages are thrown into the mix. “It’s better to be an honest nobody than a crooked somebody,” declares Michael’s father. Well, that depends. If you’re looking for a friend, the first should do. But in this film, the second kind of person makes for a livelier story."

Depends on whom you ask. I went in to “Studio 54,” a new documentary directed by Matt Tyrnauer, thinking definitely not.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018But the movie won me over. In part because Ian Schrager, who partnered with Steve Rubell to open the legendary and notorious nightclub in 1977 — and who with Rubell was sentenced to prison for tax evasion in 1980 — appears as the film’s primary interviewee. Mr. Schrager has tended to aggressively avoid the kind of spotlight Rubell, who died in 1989, seemed to crave. Now a successful hotelier, Mr. Schrager, speaking in plain Brooklynese, frankly and fondly discusses, for the first time on camera, the creation of the decadent disco and its lightning-quick downfall.The time he describes was an intoxicating and intoxicated one. It was also a callous one, which the movie’s first half overlooks a little, as various surviving habitués of the club bathe in a warm nostalgic glow in interviews. But that quality peeps out in archival film when Roy Cohn, the cold-eyed, admittedly ruthless lawyer who first achieved fame as an aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy, shows up to represent Rubell and Mr. Schrager with their legal travails intensifying. And especially when Rubell, on being asked by a TV reporter to comment on his partner’s arrest, shrugs and says, “I’m very fond of Ian.”The movie is a fast account that is sometimes a tad facile in its analysis of a cultural moment. But as Mr. Schrager’s personal too-much-too-soon story, it’s compelling."

The title is Arabic for “duty,” and here the obligation is shared by father and son. Abu Shadi, an aging divorcee living in a Christian Palestinian community in Nazareth, is driving around his neighborhood and its outskirts all day at the beginning of the Christmas season — he’s got “Jingle Bells” as his phone’s ringtone — hand-delivering invitations to his daughter’s wedding. With him is his son, Shadi, an architect who now makes his home in Rome.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 28, 2018Their duty dictates that they go door to door as a team, but their united front is strained. Abu Shadi is unhappy that Shadi has left Nazareth, and that he’s involved with a woman whose father is a Palestinian activist — “a P.L.O. leader,” Abu Shadi says indignantly. Shadi bristles at the prospect of visiting one neighbor who he says conducted surveillance on Shadi and his friends when they were at school.Despite their mutual irritation, there’s a real bond here; it helps that the characters are played by a real life father and son, Mohammad Bakri and Saleh Bakri. Their sessions with neighbors who have varied survival strategies are suffused with intrigue and philosophical pertinence, and their exchanges with each other pivot from exasperation to affection more often than the other way around.Ms. Jacir is a thrifty filmmaker; there’s nothing frilly in this movie. But she is also a sensitive and imaginative and resourceful one. The film’s final scene, a lyrical sunset that ends with a nearly four-minute unbroken shot in which the father and son converse with amity and resolution, is a fine testimony to the director’s powers."

In “Wobble Palace,” a comedy that centers on the trials of try-hard millennials, Eugene (Eugene Kotlyarenko) and Jane (Dasha Nekrasova) are a couple in the death throes of their relationship. They see other people, but they haven’t broken up because neither wants to move out of the apartment they share in downtown Los Angeles — an art-freak crash pad with AstroTurf carpets and curtains printed to look like a crowded Windows desktop, complete with the ubiquitous grassy knoll.To satisfy their desire for time to themselves, they decide to split the apartment over a weekend. Eugene’s day comes first, and he begins it by swiping through Tinder on the toilet. It would be impossible to miss that Eugene is balding. Around the shiny dome of his forehead, his remaining hair passes his shoulders. By the time Eugene’s date appears for brunch, he has fashioned a hair piece that is as fantastic as it is foolhardy: He wraps his stringy fringe into a bun and fastens it above his bald spot. It’s a style he calls the “floating toupee.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018The date does not go well. But the coif is magnificent, an exposed ego of an updo that communicates all the shoestring pretensions of the world Eugene and Jane occupy together. In fitting concordance with his self-conscious character, Mr. Kotlyarenko directed the film, and the story was conceived by both its stars. Every moment is as cringe-worthy and creative as Eugene’s floating toupee. Movies about the millennial moment are multitudinous, but “Wobble Palace” is special: a sendup of broke-artist types that shimmers with abashed affection."

Those would be Nick (Sam Gittins), returning home for Christmas after a long absence, and his Indian girlfriend, Annji (Neerja Naik), whose presence is catnip to Nick’s foulmouthed, racist Granddad (a snarling David Bradley).Trying to leave, the couple discovers the entire house has been sealed by a shiny-black, impenetrable membrane. Has there been a terrorist attack, or a nuclear accident?VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 28, 2018“Stay indoors and await further instructions,” read the sickly green letters on the television screen. As Nick’s anxious mother, pregnant sister and doltish brother-in-law bicker and fuss, his father (Grant Masters) takes charge, insisting that the television’s increasingly sinister and divisive dictates be followed exactly. But when suspiciously unsterile “vaccination kits” drop down the chimney like ominous Christmas gifts, Nick and Annji rebel.Harnessing the rhythms of the sitcom and the tropes of the season — there’s even a pitch-black evocation of the Nativity — Mr. Kevorkian casts a wide social-satire net, massaging the link between generational abuse and blind obedience to authority. Horror derives as much from the narrowness of his characters’ minds as the Cronenbergian mortifications of their flesh, creating an all-too-plausible nightmare of media’s ability to turn brother against brother. And while most movies of this type simply peter out, “Instructions” maintains such an unswerving commitment to its dark purpose that its final, gorgeously tenebrous images will leave you wobbly for days."

Her husband, Richard, used to run an experimental theater and now, without undue sourness, runs an artisanal pickle company. The couple live in a cluttered, cozy apartment on an East Village block not yet overrun by money. They are literate, witty people (played by Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti) who might rather be smart than nice but are generally pretty nice anyway, even to each other. Their mutual prickliness is a sign of long intimacy, as if they were two cut-to-match pieces of sandpaper. Over the years of their relationship — he’s 47, she’s about a half-decade younger — neither one has been too badly scraped up or smoothed out by the other.It’s a happy marriage, in other words, though one that is touched with midlife melancholy. Contentment and disappointment sit so close together on the spectrum of shared experience that it can be hard to tell one from the other. The one thing that’s missing from Rachel and Richard’s lives — the pursuit of which gives “Private Life,” Tamara Jenkins’s piquant and perfect new comedy, its shape and momentum — is a baby.A heartbreaking adoption near miss lies in the recent past, and they are in the midst of a long, fertility-treatment roller-coaster ride when we first meet them. Literally in the midst: The opening scene is of Richard administering an injection to Rachel’s backside. But while “Private Life” has funny and heartfelt insights (as well as some potentially useful information) on modern technologically assisted reproduction and its discontents, the movie is not only or even primarily about fruitless efforts to multiply. Someone once said that life is what happens while you’re making other plans. This movie is about the plans that happen while you’re trying to make another life.Rachel and Richard are not the only household in the picture. Richard has a brother named Charlie (John Carroll Lynch), a prosperous periodontist who lives in the suburbs with his wife, Cynthia (Molly Shannon), and their teenage daughter, Charlotte (Emily Robinson). Charlotte has a half sister, Sadie (Kayli Carter) — biologically unrelated to Richard or Rachel — who is adrift and unhappy at 25, trying to finish college and figure out how to live for her art.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 1, 2018Ms. Jenkins, whose previous features include “The Savages” and “Slums of Beverly Hills,” patiently assembles a structure suited either to melodrama or farce. Sadie moves in with Rachel and Richard, promoting them from cool aunt and uncle to idealized surrogate parents. It’s not spoiling much to say that they eventually see in her the potential for a different kind of surrogacy, but the story plays out in wonderfully (and sometimes appallingly) surprising ways. Though it is poignant and funny in nearly equal measure, the most remarkable aspect of “Private Life” may be its lack of noticeable exaggeration. Ms. Jenkins is working at the scale of life, with the confidence that the ordinary, if viewed from the right angle, will provide enough drama and humor to sustain our interest.In this regard, “Private Life” feels almost like a French movie, though its kinship with other recent New York tales — Noah Baumbach’s “While We’re Young,” Ira Sachs’s “Love Is Strange,” some episodes of “Girls” and “High Maintenance” — is obvious enough. Ms. Jenkins revels in the specificity of the characters, in their tastes and habits and imperfections, without bloating any of them into representative or stereotypical figures. It would have been easy to overdo Richard’s grouchiness, Rachel’s volatility or Sadie’s blithe, oversharing sense of entitlement, or to turn Charlie and Cynthia into cartoons of blundering dadness and high-flying helicopter maternalism.But if everyone is a little bit ridiculous, nobody is set up to be mocked. The comedy, like the pathos, comes from recognition, and not in a narrowly sociological sense. These are just people, after all.These are some amazing actors, in other words. You may think you have seen all of Mr. Giamatti’s variations on frustrated masculinity — or that this role lands too close to his bitter sweet spot — but Richard’s slumped posture, his nervous energy, his swerves from thin-skinned exasperation to stoical decency made me think I had either discovered a new planet or accidentally walked past a mirror. Ms. Hahn, one of popular culture’s not-so-secret weapons (from “Our Idiot Brother” to “Transparent” to “I Love Dick”), is a vivid performer and also an exquisitely subtle one. Rachel rattles off a lot of the script’s best jokes, but her eyes, especially when she’s looking at Sadie, tell an almost unspeakably complex story of affection, envy, reluctance and regret.Ms. Carter, a less familiar presence, in some ways tackles the biggest challenge. Sadie is, at least potentially, a foil, a rival, the object of generational resentment and a symbol of hope (or despair) for the future. That’s a lot of baggage for a young person to handle, and Sadie does so partly by ignoring it altogether. She doesn’t regard herself as a supporting character in her aunt and uncle’s narrative. She’s the protagonist of her own movie, as Cynthia and Charlie are of theirs. An equally interesting movie — about empty nesting rather than incubation — could have focused on their marriage.Not that I would want anything different about “Private Life,” even as I often found myself wishing that everyone in it would take it easier on themselves and one another. Though if they did, it wouldn’t really be life, and it wouldn’t be art either. The joy of this film is how completely it’s both."

By missing the first scene you will be bereft of some ostensibly essential plot material concerning a rocket crash, alien organisms fetched from the East Malaysia scene of said crash, one such alien organism taking over a variety of human bodies, and so on.But if you do in fact enter the theater as the film’s action moves to San Francisco, you will be better able to enjoy “Venom” as a loose remake of the 1981 comedy “Stripes,” with the stalwart actor Tom Hardy in the Bill Murray role. No, seriously, it checks out. Mr. Hardy’s character is a relaxed, near-slovenly but very charming fellow named Eddie Brock who manages to lose his job, his fiancée and his apartment all in the space of a single day, more or less. Are you following me?VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018Here, though, the solution to Eddie’s life challenges lies not in joining the military, but in being joined by an aforementioned alien “symbiote,” one named Venom, who finds Eddie a comfortable fit. When Venom dominates Eddie, he takes on a form that can only be called ridiculously terrifying. Black skin as shiny as patent leather, rheumy eyes the color of spilled milk, tongue an obscenely wriggling raw jumbo hot dog, and the teeth — oh, what teeth he has. Ugly as sin and hungry for human heads, Venom gives Eddie invulnerability against the baddies who pursue him. And Eddie, eventually, gives Venom (who has confided to his host that he’s part of a mission to destroy Earth) a semblance of humanity.In the scenes in which Eddie and Venom get to know each other, so to speak, Mr. Hardy’s outlandishly physical performance bolsters the movie’s not-infrequent flashes of wit. Sometimes “Venom,” directed by Ruben Fleischer, feels like a David Cronenberg body-horror movie (like “Rabid” or “The Fly”) played for slapstick, as when Venom compels Eddie to climb into a lobster tank at a chic restaurant.ImageTom Hardy in “Venom.”CreditFrank Masi/Columbia Pictures - Sony PicturesMichelle Williams plays Anne, Eddie’s estranged fiancée, and for much of the movie she’s just called upon to advance the plot. And to call that plot a conventional Marvel-style contrivance is an understatement. The movie zips to a commonplace climactic set piece, with two admittedly nifty computer-generated monsters battling it out to decide the fate of humankind. You know: for kids! In any event, by this point the movie’s wit has definitively dried up. (The resemblance to “Stripes” is long gone by this time, too.)It takes a while for Ms. Williams’s very-buttoned-up character to actually join the fun, but when she finally and momentarily does — I am reluctant to reveal just how — it’s almost enough to make you want a sequel in which her character has more to do. Emphasis, alas, on “almost.” Because ultimately, the ingratiating eccentricities of “Venom” aren’t enough to really distinguish the movie from its superhero-movie brethren as it devolves into the usual expensive orgy of sound, fury and wisecracking."

Despite seamy, well-chosen locations, Mr. Gooding is way too heavy-handed in his scoring and visual choices. But the movie deserves credit for its untempered nastiness. With one exception, Mr. Gooding refuses to redeem any of his characters, and certainly not the one he plays: Rodney, a former boxing star reduced to working as a bouncer, a job that eventually brings him into contact with Mr. Dreyfuss’s character.Rodney’s task is to provide compromising evidence on the son-in-law of the gangster’s business associate, a blackmail scheme that, executed properly, could redound to the benefit of several people, including a celebrity-hungry teenager (Lia Marie Johnson) and a photographer (Famke Janssen).Thanks to some clever plotting — Mr. Gooding is credited alongside Eitan Gorlin with the script — the lucrative possibilities grow.

While the agency was founded during the Eisenhower administration, it was President John F. Kennedy, Ms. Kennedy’s uncle (the filmmaker is the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy), who defined NASA’s mission for the better part of a generation by instructing it to set its sights on a manned mission to Earth’s moon.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 1, 2018NASA put man on the moon for the first time in 1969, via Apollo 11, and that landing brought the world together in a way those who witnessed it swear had never happened before or since. This is just one of the achievements chronicled in “Above and Beyond,” which Ms. Kennedy also narrates. Featuring contributions from assorted NASA scientists and historians, the movie considers space missions less as vehicles for human adventure — though its treatments of several NASA missions that resulted in loss of human life is sensitive — than as explorations of what’s out there. And specifically, the question of whether there’s another planet that can sustain something like human life.Illustrations from covers of 1950s pulp magazines shown here remind the viewer of human hopes to someday colonize Venus or Mars, planets that NASA’s crafts and instruments found to be “too hot, too cratered, with bad atmosphere,” as one scientist puts it. The film also shows how the space agency looks out for life here on Earth, monitoring from the sky the health of our coral reef ecosystems. This is not a spectacular picture, but it’s an informative and heartening one that might make a good double feature with “First Man,” the forthcoming fictionalized blockbuster about Apollo 11."

He had left following the death of his loving father (David Zayas) and found success in the corporate world. The company he works for is now ordering him to help gentrify the very neighborhood he abandoned.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018Ralphi’s assignment runs counter to what he’d been taught as a youth — dedication to the Puerto Rican community, loyalty to his family — and, as expected, he’s branded a traitor by his former flame, Josie (Kimberli Flores), and his brother, Junior (Gilbert Saldivar). Before long he’s forced to choose between his conscience and his career.Salsa music and dance seep into nearly every moment and are often the better parts of the scenes. Early sequences show Ralphi and Junior in action; later ones, set in clubs and studios, place yet more movement in the background. A let’s-put-on-a-show finale wraps it all together.Both Mr. Burgos and Mr. Saldivar are professional dancers and they deliver the steps, though the dialogue can be cumbersome. Still, the salsa scenes are the main draw here, and while the camerawork is unremarkable — zoom in, then pull back, then repeat — the energy stays high. No matter where these characters wind up, it seems, a dance will soon break out."

This last is delivered by his sister, Maggie (Anjelica Huston), though she’s not the only relative who wishes him ill: another tries to smother him with a pillow. Family, it seems, is not Ben’s forte.Purportedly a comedy, this sophomore feature from the playwright Theresa Rebeck is so dismally unfunny that the descriptor should come with quotation marks. As Maggie, a widow living smugly on inherited land in rural Vermont, Ms. Huston doesn’t walk and talk so much as stride and yell. A tough-as-old-boots, indoor hat-wearer, Maggie is incredulous when the long-estranged Ben — a wastrel with a grotty trailer and not much else — shows up with a backhoe and a scheme to weasel a share of the land he claims is rightfully his. Feuding ensues.Bogged down by a plot resting on unpaid taxes, illegally obtained permits and other real-estate paraphernalia, “Trouble” makes a whole lot of noise without saying very much. The direction is wooden and the cinematography dull, leaving the solid cast (including Julia Stiles as a daffy clerk and Jim Parrack as her knuckle-dragging boyfriend) to shoulder the weight. David Morse is gratifyingly restrained as a friend with an inexplicable crush on Maggie, but it’s Mr. Pullman who’s worth watching. Most recently, in a fascinatingly off-kilter performance as a damaged detective in “The Sinner” on USA Network, he reminded us there’s always been something itchy and unreliable about his work, an unsteadiness that humanizes his dented characters. Ben might be reprehensible, but somehow he persuades us it’s Maggie who deserves to go down."

Unconvincing battle scenes, though, aren’t the half of it: this second feature from David L.G.

Whatever the era, the director or the headliners, it relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man who’s furiously racing to the bottom (Bradley Cooper in this movie) and a woman (Lady Gaga) who’s soaring to the top. This latest and fourth version is a gorgeous heartbreaker (bring tissues). Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.Like the last iteration, the epically (empirically!) terrible 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, the new one takes place in a contemporary music world that is by turns exciting, suffocating and crowded with dangers — ravenous fans, crushing performance demands, celebrity itself. This is the world that has helped create and come close to ruining Jackson Maine (Mr. Cooper), a country-rock musician who, when the movie opens, is performing obviously wasted, leaning and nearly falling into a boot-stomping song. He’s a beautiful ruin adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills.ImageLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in “A Star Is Born.” Mr. Cooper, who also directed, has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears.CreditWarner Bros.A singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) becomes Jack’s safe harbor, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal. That’s a heavy burden, but Ally is one of life’s chin-up survivors, with an errant mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo (a terrific Andrew Dice Clay), whose dreams cloud her own. Dad runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues (Barry Shabaka Henley, among others) and their boisterous camaraderie fill the rooms, both warming and crowding them. Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.She and Jack first meet late one night in a Hollywood drag club where she sings after her waitress shift ends. Jack has just finished playing a concert and, after polishing off a bottle of booze, has stumbled into the club for more. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard “La Vie en Rose,” in a sheath and upsweep, her arched artificial brows adding quizzical punctuation to her face. In a swoon, he invites her out that night, and, as flirtation gives way to deeper feelings, they fall in love. He brings Ally onstage and then on tour, but she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline.[Read about “A Star Is Born” and male sacrifice.]Mr. Cooper, who also directed, does a lot right in this take on “A Star Is Born,” beginning with the casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movie’s force. A post-Madonna pop artist known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes, she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. This unmasking of Lady Gaga also makes Ally seem genuine, authentic, a quality that the movie champions and that serves as a kind of thematic first principle.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows — he’s flirting, but he’s also saying that he sees the real her and wants the world to as well. Playful yet unapologetically earnest, this scene inaugurates a seduction — of Ally, of us — that lasts the exhilarating first hour. Mr. Cooper understands the power of big-screen myths, including thunderstruck love and near-magical lucky breaks. He also understands his own star appeal (he gives himself plenty of heat-stoking close-ups), which dovetails with his role as director. When Ally and Jack look at each other, you’re watching two people fall in love, and it’s a contact high. You’re also watching a director guiding — creating — his star as life seeps into fiction.Mr. Cooper’s smartest decision, other than casting Lady Gaga, is the absolute sincerity with which he’s taken on this material, in all its gorgeous, gaudy excess. He has refurbished the story some and added a bit too much psychological filler, but he has stayed true to its fundamental seriousness. Winking at this story would have been easy, but would have destroyed it. Instead, working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, Mr. Cooper has gone all in with big emotions and cascades of tears. (The movie owes a debt to, and nods at, the original 1937 film as well as the 1954 remake with a peerless Judy Garland.)Part of what’s exciting about this “A Star Is Born” is that Mr. Cooper knows he’s telling one of the defining Hollywood stories and has given the movie the polish and scale it merits. He plays with intimacy and cinematic sweep, going in close when Ally and Jack are together so that the world falls away — a scene of them in a parking lot shows how conversation turns to courtship — only to then pull back so we can see the enormity of the world the lovers inhabit once Jack takes Ally on tour. And while the crowd seems little more than a surging blur the first time Jack plays, when Ally looks at the throng, she sees it and so do we.ImageMr. Cooper and Lady Gaga in “A Star Is Born” — he’s damaged, she’s insecure.CreditWarner Bros. Pictures[Seen “A Star Is Born”? Read Kyle Buchanan’s take, with spoilers]The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing are revved up but personal. (The production borrowed crowds from actual music festivals like Coachella, and their sheer size conveys the scope of Jack’s stardom.) Mr. Cooper sings pleasantly enough and throttles an electric guitar with persuasive fervor. He’s backed by the group Lukas Nelson & the Promise of the Real (Lukas’s dad is Willie Nelson). The music mixes standards with new songs, some written by Mr. Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga, whose supple, often electric singing can, at full throttle, express intensities of feeling far better than the dialogue.Like many filmmakers, Mr. Cooper sometimes explains too much. It isn’t enough that Jack drinks; Mr. Cooper wants us to know why. So, he fleshes out Jack’s past, turning melodrama into therapy and robbing the character of mystery. One of the weakest scenes, a violent confrontation between Jack and his much-older brother, Bobby (Sam Elliott, whose deep drawl Mr. Cooper has borrowed), is an information dump. In one of the finest, Bobby just wordlessly drives away from Jack, and Mr. Elliott lets you see the ferocity of the brothers’ love — and their pain — in eyes that have begun to water and in a stone face that will shatter.Mr. Cooper spends more time on the story’s male lead than previous iterations have, perhaps because he’s taken the role himself. The focus on Jack — he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery — somewhat weighs down the remainder of the movie, partly because too much of it is overly familiar. At times, Mr. Cooper seems to share Jack’s unease with Ally’s stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager (Rafi Gavron, oozing sleaze) and transforms from a soulful crooner into a writhing automaton with soulless beats and backup singers. Ally puts on the mask that Mr. Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that — unlike Jack’s — her art is less than pure.Male self-aggrandizement is baked into the story’s foundation but not ruinously. Jack doesn’t just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break she needs. His trauma — she’s insecure, but he’s damaged — becomes a deep well that she draws from, allowing her to become a greater artist. In part, the story is as creaky as that of Pygmalion, the male sculptor who turns a beloved carving into a woman. Yet one of the pleasures of “A Star Is Born” in all its renditions is that it is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty."

L.I.F.E.”: “The hate you gave little infants [expletive] everybody,” he said of systematic injustices. “What you feed us as seeds, grows and blows up in your face.” More than two decades after his death, his message was worked into “The Hate U Give,” Angie Thomas’s best-selling 2017 novel about a black teenager who experiences those inequalities firsthand.“Pac’s gonna always be relevant,” Khalil (Algee Smith) insists to his childhood friend Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) in this uneven film adaptation directed by George Tillman Jr. Moments later, Khalil will be dead, shot by a jittery white police officer who pulls them over and mistakes his hairbrush for a gun.The messy thing about relevancy is that sometimes it means not enough has changed for the better. One way to reckon with this fact is through art — which is why, as more black artists have gotten behind the camera and entered the writers’ room, the police brutality narrative has almost become a genre unto itself. Some recent works, like “Queen Sugar,” the TV series created by Ava DuVernay, and Solange Knowles’s 2016 album, “A Seat at the Table,” have been better than others at exploring the psychological toll of that brutality with care and nuance. Mr. Tillman’s “The Hate U Give” (with a screenplay by Audrey Wells) lies somewhere in the middle.ImageAmandla Stenberg in the film adaptation of Angie Thomas’s best-selling book, “The Hate U Give.”CreditErika Doss/Twentieth Century FoxThe film opens with a powerful affirmation of blackness, both in the beauty of it and the burden. In voice-over, Starr recalls her father, Maverick (Russell Hornsby, excellent), giving “The Talk,” a familiar rite of passage for many black Americans about navigating (and surviving) a predominantly white world, to her younger self and two brothers. He wants to instill in them a sense of pride and the tenets of the Black Panther Party’s Ten-Point Program.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnOct. 1, 2018As a teenager, Starr is a sneakerhead who uncomfortably straddles opposing worlds — Garden Heights, a predominantly black and lower-income neighborhood, is the place she’s always called home; Williamson Prep, a fancy predominantly white private school, is where she and her siblings, Seven (Lamar Johnson) and Sekani (TJ Wright), attend school. She works hard every day to keep them separate, hiding her white boyfriend, Chris (K.J. Apa), from her father, while policing her own appearance and actions at school. Black vernacular makes her white classmates cool, she observes. “Slang makes me ‘hood.’”Her code switching is the most intriguing story line here, partly because young black female protagonists in popular culture are still few and far between. (A majority of recent films and TV shows starring black characters, like “Insecure” and the “She’s Gotta Have It” TV remake, have focused on 20- and 30-somethings.) Ms. Stenberg strikingly embodies Starr’s dichotomies — self-doubt and bouts of confidence; introversion and outspokenness — but the film’s driving plot is Khalil’s death and how it pushes Starr to come into her own as an activist.Yet the script struggles to effectively weave this all together with the kind of thoughtful complexity that Ms. Thomas brought to her young-adult novel. Mr. Apa’s Chris, for instance, makes for a bland if earnestly supportive boyfriend, and the film glosses over his troublesome recitation of the tired axiom “I don’t see color” when expressing his disappointment with how Starr has kept her connection to the shooting a secret.ImageRussell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Ms. Stenberg and Common in “The Hate u Give,” directed by George Tillman Jr.CreditErika Doss/Twentieth Century FoxElsewhere, the rapper Common has a small role as Starr’s uncle Carlos, a police officer. There’s only a vague understanding of the tension that comes with being in such a position, condensed to a conversation late in the film in which he defends police shootings to Starr by explaining what an officer might be thinking when interacting with a civilian. Thankfully the moment doesn’t end on a #BlueLivesMatter note, though it comes close. But it’s a missed opportunity; after a succinct rebuttal from Starr, the plot pushes on.That’s the other thing about cultural relevancy — if you rely on it too much at the expense of deep characterization, you’ll barely scratch the surface. Ms. Stenberg, Mr. Hornsby and others in the ensemble (including Regina Hall as Starr’s mother, Lisa) are more than capable of exploring their characters’ depths, but a wonky script gets them only so far."

The film presents a compact, tactful biography and also a valuable explication of the Keatonesque in its most sublime varieties. Coming ahead of a digital restoration of Keaton’s major films, it serves as both a primer and refresher, as well as a promise that he will not be forgotten.Mr. Bogdanovich is an able and amiable guide to Keaton’s life and work. He knows a lot about filmmaking — having made a few himself — and about the history and lore of Old Hollywood. His voice itself can sound like the echo of a bygone era, as he refers to movies as “pictures” and chuckles suavely to himself at the glamour and absurdity of it all. An astute analyst of directing technique, Mr. Bogdanovich sometimes falls back on hollow critic-speak, enthusing over the perfection and brilliance of gags that speak just fine for themselves. But his selections from well- and lesser-known Keaton films are illuminating and astute.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 25, 2018A fair amount of the talking is given over to experts and celebrities, who are, as often in documentaries like this, a mixed bag. Since very few people who knew Keaton well are still alive, the job of bringing him back to life falls mainly to historians and critics, while the task of selling him to devotees of 21st-century pop culture is handled by comedians, actors and directors. These include Quentin Tarantino, Bill Hader, Cybill Shepherd, Richard Lewis, Johnny Knoxville and Werner Herzog. A few of them offer real insight into Keaton’s influence, but mostly they use him as an occasion to revel in their own amazingness.Fair enough. Keaton nonetheless emerges in all his enigmatic, melancholy glory. “The Great Buster” benefits from an unconventional structure. A chronological biography comes first, following Keaton’s evolution from a vaudeville child star (in an act with his parents) to a star and director of two-reel short comedies in the late 1910s and early ’20s.The 10 feature films he made in the middle years of that decade — on which his reputation as a great filmmaker rests — are mentioned and then set aside for later discussion. That’s because the story that follows is, for the most part, a sad one. With the advent of sound, the end of Keaton’s first marriage and his ill-considered decision to give up independent production and sign on with MGM, he lost his way in Hollywood and never quite recovered it. A trouper to his bones, he continued to work, appearing in television commercials, teenage beach-party movies and Samuel Beckett’s “Film,” among other projects.As charming and touching as some of that work is, it adds up to a long, dispiriting epilogue to a period of greatness. Mr. Bogdanovich’s concise concluding survey of that period — full of sidesplitting, eye-popping clips from “The General,” “Steamboat Bill, Jr.,” “Our Hospitality” and other marvels — is wonderful, and fulfills the main purpose of this documentary. It’s a celebration and also an invitation to some of the purest, strangest laughter the screen has to offer."

That’s one takeaway from “Moynihan,” a conventional but entertaining rundown of the greatest hits of the life of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.This documentary from Joseph Dorman and Toby Perl Freilich won’t have much new to offer anyone who followed the work of Moynihan (1927-2003), the former Harvard professor, ambassador and four-term Democratic senator from New York. But it makes the case for him as a towering figure whose passion, wit and wonkiness now seem like precious qualities in governance.The movie finds consistency in a career that variously saw Moynihan lay groundwork for major antipoverty legislation and, after he had sowed skepticism among allies by working for Richard M. Nixon, become branded by critics as a neoconservative. (That was a term that his wife, Elizabeth, says he hated.)The case here is that he was one of the last of the true New Deal Democrats, an individual who had seen the Great Depression firsthand and believed that government was capable of helping people. That philosophy reverberated in his 1965 Labor Department paper “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,” which became known as the Moynihan Report, and in which he argued that the government needed to enhance the stability of African-American families. The movie takes what today is a common position that the report was often misunderstood or oversimplified in original news reports and was, at the time, groundbreaking in its analysis of history and of structural racism.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 28, 2018“The Moynihan Report was the last point where you had a federal official making an argument — an implicit argument — for massive investment in African-American communities, massive benevolent investment, and tying that case for investment to history,” the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates says in the film.The film gives less voice to critics of the report (or of Moynihan generally), although Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia’s delegate to the House of Representatives, explains why it was seen as blaming the victim or at least a misdiagnosis — a white man seeming to criticize African-American families at a time when families were a bedrock and black activists were pushing for voting rights and legislation outlawing employment discrimination.Moynihan’s focus on broken homes is portrayed as personal: It’s explained that his father walked out on his family and that he fell from the middle to the working class. His biographer Godfrey Hodgson speculates that he was motivated by fear of an economic abyss.Did Moynihan accomplish anything? His quarter-century as a senator gets a somewhat backloaded treatment in a movie organized more around his ideas and personality than the jobs he held. But among other things, the sociologist Kathryn Edin cites good results from the 1990s expansion of the earned-income tax credit, presented as a spiritual successor to the failed Family Assistance Plan that Moynihan pushed for under Nixon.If anything, “Moynihan” leaves you wanting to watch more of the man. Perhaps too immersed in numbers for politics and too much of a dabbler for academia, he was also a showman — and therefore a natural movie subject."

More sedentary viewers, though — perhaps less focused on the technical niceties of defying gravity — might discover something arguably even more fascinating in this layered documentary: A cautionary study of what can happen when you don’t hug your children.Mr. Honnold, now 33, would eventually teach himself to hug, at least as it applies to human interaction. He has always seemed to know how to embrace a rock face, to jam fingers and toes into the tiniest of cracks and scamper upward with near-mystical ease. Rejecting company, ropes or pitons (except the occasional strays left behind by more conventional climbers), he has completed more than 1,000 solitary ascents and is reputed to be the greatest surviving free-soloist. In a sport where a rogue wind or a single, startled bird can send you hurtling to your death, not too many practitioners live long enough to earn a tribute like this one.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 24, 2018As anyone familiar with the directors’ 2015 mountaineering movie, “Meru,” will know, heart-stopping camera angles and crisp, vertigo-inducing vistas are a given. Yet this husband-and-wife team also have a knack for exposing, without exploiting, a little of the man beneath the apparent madness. And as Mr. Honnold, all eyes and ears and boyish eagerness, brightly speaks of an emotionally isolated childhood and the once “bottomless pit of self-loathing” that has driven him upward, his meticulous preparations to scale El Capitan in Yosemite National Park take on a ritualistic cast. To the uninitiated, the intricate markings in his obsessively maintained climbing journal appear as mysterious as runes cast to keep him safe.It seems fitting that the veteran climber Tommy Caldwell, dozens of whose friends have died (which an in memoriam montage corroborates), describes climbing with Mr. Honnold as “a vice.” Karate-kicking across a gap on something appropriately called “The Boulder Problem,” or dangling by a fingernail over a void, he gives us plenty of opportunities to follow the lead of one of the cameramen and turn our heads away. This calm acceptance of death is one that thrives on having no attachment to the ground; so when he acquires a serious girlfriend, the sunny Sanni McCandless, his newly tethered emotions are as much of a challenge as the minimally-appointed van he has lived in for almost a decade. It’s bad enough living with a human fly; only a woman in love would tolerate a home with no bathroom.A Record-Setting Climb Up El Capitan, Without RopesOn Saturday, the professional climber Alex Honnold became the first to climb the nearly 3,000-foot El Capitan, Yosemite’s iconic granite wall, without ropes, called free soloing.June 5, 2017Despite a somewhat soft middle section, “Free Solo” is an engaging study of a perfect match between passion and personality. Though resisting psychoanalysis, the directors watch as an M.R.I. of Mr. Honnold’s brain, perhaps unsurprisingly, suggests one that requires supernormal levels of stimulation. His concerned mother, Dierdre Wolownick (one of whose favorite sayings, Mr. Honnold recalls, was “Almost doesn’t count”), wonders if he has Asperger’s syndrome, but the man himself is unfazed by speculation.“Nobody achieves anything great by being happy and cozy,” he says, reveling in his perilous talents. Maybe Ms. McCandless can convince him otherwise, but I somehow doubt it."

And that she is a feminist heroine as well.Shot and assembled in the conventional style of talking heads alternating with archival footage, it begins with Ms. Jett’s early teen-years acquisition, in 1974, of a Sears Silvertone guitar — a cheap but potent ax with an amplifier and speaker built right into its case.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018Her first band, the all-girl Runaways, stirred controversy in the 1970s while bridging the aesthetic gap between glam and punk. A dissolute post-breakup mourning period ended when Ms. Jett met Kenny Laguna, a songwriter and producer whose bubble-gum roots found an affinity with Ms. Jett’s sexy, riff-driven brand of hard rock and helped form her lasting band, the Blackhearts.The movie chronicles music industry tales of glory and failure. These are dishy, but more interesting is Ms. Jett’s rock ‘n’ roll heart. The stories of how she mentored younger bands are moving.The film skates over a few things. Allegations that the Runaways’ self-aggrandizing manager Kim Fowley raped the group’s bassist, which have been published in interviews with other band members, do not get an airing. (Mr. Fowley died in 2015.) Ms. Jett, who in profiles reveals little about her private life, stays the course here. (There’s a strong sense, though, that her work, anchored by the long collaboration with Mr. Laguna, is her life.)One unanswered question particularly frustrated me: How did a woman raised in Philadelphia, Maryland and Los Angeles wind up with what sounds like a completely unaffected Brooklyn accent? Some things apparently defy explanation."

All three are men of color with loving families and a great deal to lose — an athletic scholarship, a new job, a hard-won promotion — their actions complicated by divided loyalties and, in at least one case, a newly awakened social conscience. Moral and behavioral lapses are slipped quietly into the narrative without remark, giving depth to characters whose stories are so sparse and rushed they risk becoming merely symbolic. Like a distracted news anchor, the movie’s attention shifts from one section to the next with minimal overlap, leaving the men’s fates as unresolved as the issues they dramatize.Turning black-white conflict into a laudably complex wash of gray, Mr. Green (inspired in part by a conversation he had with a police officer about the 2014 death of Eric Garner) favors reason over outrage. The political heat rises but the movie stays cool, its smooth, smart climax in keeping with its levelheaded tone. Whether in the middle of a protest or a dinner party, Patrick Scola’s camera moves fluidly and evocatively, peering over shoulders like an eavesdropper or shadowing characters from behind. The effect is moody and a little threatening, suggesting a feeling of being tailed that some might find all too familiar.At times, the narrative’s topicality is almost obtrusive. Aside from the initial killing (whose victim, like Mr. Garner, was selling loose cigarettes outside a convenience store), further recognizable plot points — including the fatal shooting of two police officers and the merging of athletics and peaceful protest — mimic real life so closely that we’re lifted out of the movie and into the news cycle.It’s left to the actors, then, to keep us close, and not one of them shirks the task, injecting intellectual and emotional nuance that frequently transcends the script. This powerful ensemble makes “Monsters and Men,” while far from a fully-formed conversation, a very fine place to start."

Leading with a sly smile, she easily talks dirty but also lets you see the fissures in Nina’s demonstrative belligerence, making you wonder where real life ends and the act begins. Ms. Winstead is so good that she even shows you the movie that could have been, one without the clichés and therapy talk.Written and directed by Eva Vives, making her ragged feature debut, the movie follows Nina as she tries to kick-start her floundering life. Her career seems to have stalled out, and her guy du jour (Chace Crawford) is an abusive jerk. She should call the cops on him, but doesn’t, perhaps because he’s on the force himself. There’s nothing much keeping her in New York, so she heads to Los Angeles, where she finds a world of la-la land clichés that are never as funny as they should be. (“I need trees around me, I’m water based,” a gaga Angeleno, played by Kate del Castillo, announces with a vibe that could be friendly or merely nuts.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018“All About Nina” is a story of self-discovery (and self-care) that rests uneasily at the very jammed crossroads of comedy, drama, romance and self-actualization. An early scene with the abusive guy she can’t fully quit makes it apparent that Nina has some serious things she needs to work out, which she does with brittle jokes, some begrudgingly observed life lessons and a new, rapidly deployed romance. The new guy, Rafe (Common), isn’t a fast closer, but when the story throws him together with Nina it’s instantly evident from the flirty talk (and from Common’s star status) where they are headed. After the usual wining, dining and sharing, Nina reconsiders her allegiance to hookups, having found a seemingly perfect dude.The two actors are an attractive but unpersuasive fit, though their shared awkwardness dissipates after Nina and Rafe get stoned in his picture-perfect pad. Once they’re high, they calm down (and so do the actors). They talk, naturally, lazily, discovering each other with words and laughs. Ms. Vives’s visual choices are largely generic (they’re made worse by the dingy digital), but here she places the camera above the characters so that it points directly down at them. Nina and Rafe are supine on the floor with their heads next to each other, but they’re also lying in opposite directions, which suits the exploratory stage of their liaison.It’s hard not to root for Nina, even if this prickly, intriguingly difficult character becomes considerably less interesting as the story progresses and the dialogue veers toward the therapeutic. (Nina gradually takes to the city’s healing ways.) There’s a lot of material to be found in the world of the female comic, as Ms. Vives and Ms. Winstead make clear. Watching Nina work hard at being a professionally funny woman is satisfying, whether she’s trying out new material in her empty apartment or staring into a mirror trying out her impressions (Celine Dion, Cher). Like too many American filmmakers, however, Ms. Vives weighs down her protagonist with a traumatic past that is just too heavy for a movie that otherwise often settles for glib."

The death of her grandmother, Dotty (June Squibb), puts weekend keggers and girlish gossip on pause, but unexpectedly for Jamie, Dotty authorizes a teenage rebellion. Her final words of wisdom ring coarse and clear: Abandon your mother’s Judaism, and learn the secrets of oral sex.Jamie takes Dotty’s advice literally in “Summer ’03,” a blunt family comedy. She also conveniently finds both godly and earthly delights in one package when she meets Luke (Jack Kilmer), a seminary student whose vows of celibacy are easily outweighed by the temptations of the flesh.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 24, 2018Luke soon proves that religious boys can act in bad faith, but his callousness is far from unique in “Summer ‘03.” Despite the fond nostalgia shown for Jamie’s elastic chokers and new Harry Potter books, the writer and director Becca Gleason depicts Ohio of the sun-kissed early aughts as an enclave of unrepentant — and frequent anti-Semitic — acrimony. Ms. Gleason hews to the cheerful lighting and snappy editing of high-school sitcoms, but her caustic coming-of-age curiously spares no sympathy for family, friends or faith.Noxious characters need not produce noxious films, but the meanspirited humor of “Summer ‘03” is out of place with the perky conventionality of the film’s style. A family may gripe to the cadence of jokes, but that doesn’t make the insults funny. Vacant in emotion and in cinematic perspective, the movie looks back 15 years but struggles to make an impression longer than 15 minutes."

One of the few adults who can command his respect, at least in moments, is a teacher, Rami (Ami Smolartchik). Another is his father, Milo (Yaacov Cohen), who dismisses his son’s need to study literature, because literature is dead, after all, and besides, he’s being groomed to take over the family scaffolding business.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018But as Asher prepares for a final exam, one of those father figures unexpectedly falls silent, leaving him without a guide. The event is not enough to quell Asher’s chronic anger, but it might be the jolt he needs to usher him into adulthood.Although the movie is a drama, Mr. Lax is playing a character that partly draws on his life. (He’s a former student of the writer-director, Matan Yair, who is making his first feature.) Rife with heavy-handed metaphors — and discussions of metaphors, as befits a movie about a young man studying literature — “Scaffolding” seems somewhat torn when it comes to telegraphing its own intentions. Its ambiguities of character take a back seat to a trite upshot.On an exam, Asher is to pick a work of literature and explain how its ending contributes to its meaning. The overly pat resolution of “Scaffolding” doesn’t fully pass that test."

The rest of the cast, including the great Stephen Rea, is exemplary, and the movie wastes not a second of its running time.

Forrest Tucker, whose serial bank jobs punctuate “The Old Man & the Gun,” declines to give a reason, but his motive seems to be something more mysterious — or maybe more matter-of-fact — than simple greed.Forrest likes the money just fine, but stealing it feels like an artistic pursuit, a religious practice or a geezer’s eccentric hobby. He’s like the woman in the Townes Van Zandt lyric who sings “for the sake of the song” rather than because of any external considerations.There are some good songs in David Lowery’s new film, which may also be Robert Redford’s last, and which has a certain musical quality of its own. Mr. Redford plays Forrest, a real person profiled by David Grann in a 2003 New Yorker article, like a figure out of an old ballad. Forrest doesn’t talk much, or display much emotion — his range of feeling runs from mild concern to wry amusement — but he has a touch of poetry to him, and an old-fashioned courtliness. Witnesses and victims, interviewed on the local news after he has emptied their cash drawers, recall Forrest’s good manners. “He was a gentleman,” one says, as if his theft were a compliment he had paid the bank and its employees.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018The proper compliment to give “The Old Man & The Gun” is that it treats Mr. Redford with the respect he deserves. A charismatic minimalist from the start, he has lately — in the haunting “All is Lost” and the mild-mannered “Our Souls at Night” — offered a series of master classes in understatement. At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it’s nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet. Forrest seems like a gent who would be pleasant to hang out with, easy to forgive and impossible not to admire, for how cool he is if nothing else.Mr. Lowery doesn’t burden the character — or the audience — with too much story or psychology. We learn that Forrest got an early start in his life of crime, that he has broken out of prison many times, that he has a grown daughter who lives in California. (The robberies take place mainly in Texas and nearby states. The time is the 1980s). He has two equally creaky confederates, played by Tom Waits and Danny Glover, and strikes up a romance with Jewel (Sissy Spacek), who proves susceptible to his charms even as she expresses some gentle skepticism about who he pretends to be.Meanwhile, Forrest is pursued by a detective with the absurdly allegorical (but absolutely true to life) name of John Hunt. Played by Casey Affleck, Hunt is at once Forrest’s opposite and his secret sharer: a hard worker and a family man (his wife is played by Tika Sumpter) as effortlessly honest as his nemesis is crooked. They are not exactly Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert. Mr. Lowery turns the moral and dramatic heat down to the faintest simmer, as if conducting a perverse genre experiment. How much intensity and suspense can you drain from a movie about cops and robbers without having the thing collapse into anecdote and whimsy?“The Old Man & the Gun” kind of does just that, but it’s hard to mind too much. If you work a bit, you can persuade yourself of hidden depths and metaphysical sorrows. Mr. Affleck is so melancholy. Mr. Redford is so blithe. Surely the contrast in their temperaments means something. And so do the scuffed American landscapes, where the faintest ghosts of old-time outlaws and cowboys can be discerned amid the drab commercial architecture.To return to the musical theme, the movie is like a brand-new song carefully engineered to seem timeless. Mr. Lowery is a connoisseur and a counterfeiter of Americana, whose recent features — including “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” “A Ghost Story” and the sweet 2016 remake of “Pete’s Dragon” — self-consciously pursue a dream of authenticity. They are often, at least to my eye, a little too fussed-over to be entirely convincing, and always more wishful than observant about the realities of human life. But they are also, like Forrest Tucker, gracious and skillful enough to make it feel like they’re doing you a kindness when they take your money."

Despite their alleged dietary habits, the wolves are the area’s most appealing inhabitants and not just because they don’t come across as dangerous or damaged as the human residents. Unlike all the scowling men and women, these howling beauties — who look as well-groomed as they appear well fed and trained — are also fun to watch.The director Jeremy Saulnier has a gift for seizing your attention with arresting, harmoniously balanced images that somehow seem to either briefly slow down or even freeze a movie. These visual grabbers have real pop and work somewhat like narrative punctuation by accenting a moment, a milieu or a character. (Here, he draws you in quickly with an assembly of wolves and a solitary child.) The movie keeps moving, the story keeps flowing, but these images — which feel suspended between cinema and still photography — create a pause in the action that your anxious imagination can’t help but fret over. That’s especially true because Mr. Saulnier’s images are often in service of spooky, blood-drenched tales.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018Mr. Saulnier earned — and sustained — your nervous attention in his grisly thriller “Blue Ruin” and the even better stomach-churner “Green Room,” a Grand Guignol about a punk band snared in a neo-Nazi lair. His visual flair remains the only consistently appealing part of “Hold the Dark,” a thriller that aspires to something deeper but never figures out what. (Based on a novel of the same title by William Giraldi, it was written by Macon Blair, the gore-slicked star of “Blue Ruin.”) Mr. Saulnier has pushed into somewhat different narrative terrain in this movie, which tracks a writer, Core (Jeffrey Wright), on a strange, sometimes baffling and vaguely misterioso journey into both the wilderness and the heavily trodden landscape of evil.The story is a mess, but the setting, animals and actors make for solid bait. A retired naturalist who has written about wolves, Core travels to Keelut after receiving a letter (a genuine paper missive) from Medora (an egregiously misused Riley Keough), who says that her son has been snatched by wolves and that the authorities are useless. For reasons that remain inexplicable at best (he’s got family troubles and appears depressed), he buys Medora’s tale and is soon impassively hunkered down in her home as she spins a story that seems a whole lot like a web. By the time she’s meandering around naked in the middle of the night wearing a wolf mask you’re wondering why Core hasn’t booked a seat on the next plane out.Mr. Wright projects persuasive thoughtfulness no matter how silly the material, but he can’t turn Core into a credible character. He at least gets to keep his clothes on, unlike Ms. Keough (or her body double). For the most part, he knits his brows and tries to look serious and engaged as Core descends deep, then deeper into the wild and the clotted story. A few other folks further complicate things, notably Donald (James Badge Dale), a good, principled cop who oversees the most sadly (and disastrously) inept police force since the Keystone Kops, and Vernon (a determined-looking Alexander Skarsgard), Medora’s very bad husband. He’s an American soldier who has some serious skills, an awfully big knife and what might politely be called issues.Vernon first shows up in a long, needless interlude in Falluja, Iraq, which largely demonstrates that Mr. Saulnier had the budget to shoot in Morocco. Stuff happens; blood spurts (there are multiple neck wounds). Additional characters come and go — including Yu’pik residents played by Julian Black Antelope and Tantoo Cardinal — but they’re grievously under realized, mostly just placeholders for ideas that never emerge. The physically imposing Mr. Black Antelope prominently figures in the extended gun battle that swallows the movie and clearly consumed Mr. Saulnier’s interest. The shootout is well staged, grindingly grim and mostly seems to exist so that a great deal of artificial blood can be spattered across all that pretty white snow."

Just by writing that sentence, I’m afraid I may have raised expectations too high. But now maybe I’ve lowered them too far. Not that this ragged comedy, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, is bad, exactly. It proposes a concept — summed up in the title — and follows it to a logical conclusion. But it isn’t exactly good either.In addition to Mr. Hart and Ms. Haddish, the cast includes a bunch of reasonably (and in some cases unexpectedly) funny performers, among them Romany Malco, Fat Joe, Rob Riggle and Mary Lynn Rajskub. They are allowed to be sillier than either of the two stars, who are saddled with the thankless task of providing sentimental ballast that nobody really needs. Good teachers are a blessing, and believing in yourself is important, but there are plenty of other movies that dispense those lessons more effectively than this one.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 18, 2018Even though he lacks a high school diploma — the result of a youthful anti-standardized-testing tantrum — Teddy Walker (Mr. Hart) has found success in life. A sales job he’s good at, a shiny Porsche, a beautiful fiancée (Megalyn Echikunwoke). A mishap (propane, candlelight) costs him the job, and to land another one — in finance, working with his best pal (Ben Schwartz) — Teddy needs a G.E.D. He enrolls in a class taught by Carrie (Ms. Haddish) and attended by a motley crew of strivers. Classes are held in Teddy’s former high school (the film is set in Atlanta), where the principal just happens to be his teenage nemesis (Taran Killam).The plot zigs and zags and sometimes accelerates in the direction of genuine hilarity — when Teddy takes a job at a fast-food restaurant called Christian Chicken, whenever Mr. Malco opens his mouth or Ms. Rajskub blinks her eyes — only to downshift into sloppy, easy jokes and gags. When it comes to the comic talents of Mr. Hart and Ms. Haddish, “Night School” (made under the auspices of Mr. Hart’s production company) is less a showcase than a series of teasers. Teddy and Carrie first meet in traffic, as he overhears a preposterous and profane conversation she is having on her cellphone. Later they spar verbally and even physically (in a kickboxing ring with appropriate gear).You can’t help but think that someone should put these two in a movie together. A real movie, which “Night School,” like more than a few big studio features these days, isn’t quite. It’s not as woefully dull as “Life of the Party,” which also sent its star (Melissa McCarthy, in case you’d forgotten) back to school. But it doesn’t have the snap and surprise of “Girls Trip” (Ms. Haddish’s breakout, directed by Mr. Lee), or the snarly anarchy of the “Ride Along” movies, which paired Mr. Hart with Ice Cube. Like Teddy, the movie doesn’t aspire to more than a passing grade."

Born in 1873, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette — whose more than 80 volumes include “Gigi” — had one of those lives that make biographers giddy. A passage in Judith Thurman’s “Secrets of the Flesh” suggests how much Colette crowded into her 81 gilded years: During one short eventful period, she attended a boxing match, reported on the Tour de France, rode in a dirigible and watched the police capture a gang of anarchist bank robbers (then dynamite their lair) only to be attacked by the frenzied onlookers.The anarchists and blood-crazed mob are absent from the attractive biographical movie “Colette,” which takes a light, enjoyably fizzy approach to its subject. The world that Colette (a vibrant Keira Knightley) inhabits onscreen is brighter and smaller than in Ms. Thurman’s telling, with its luminaries (Proust! Bernhardt!), morphine addicts and sex cruising. The movie’s Colette is never as wild as you might hope for a literary titan and voluptuary who first writes herself into history with her “Claudine” novels while bedding men and women alike. But she’s consistently, gratifyingly, full-bodied company.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018CreditCreditRobert Viglasky/Bleecker StreetThe director Wash Westmoreland, sharing script credit with Richard Glatzer and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, opens the movie with some misdirection that plays with your expectations. The story begins in 1892, the year before Colette turned 20 and first wed. In a dark bedroom with an indolent cat, she wakes reluctantly in the house she shares with her parents (Fiona Shaw and Robert Pugh). Everyone is speaking in English which, with the tranquillity, stippled sunlight and exuberant flora, paints a picture so pretty and familiar that you brace for tea and a yawningly polite meander down biopic lane.Then the writer Willy (Dominic West) bounds in, filling the house and movie with air and energy. Leading with his smooth manners and a paunch that will swell into a potbelly stove, he goes through the proper courtship motions. Colette’s parents are understandably impressed, unaware that their daughter and Willy — who excels at false fronts — have already been secretly meeting. Later that day, she eagerly clambers on him, announcing that she’s in charge of her desires. (Ms. Knightley takes the character from dewy youth to adulthood with expressive physicality.) And, before long, the lovers are married and in Paris, where they float between high society and the demimonde.ImageMs. Knightley, right, with Dominic West, who plays her husband, Willy.CreditRobert Viglasky/Bleecker Street“Colette” is an origin story, a tale of metamorphosis rather than of already formed greatness. What interests Mr. Westmoreland is how a self-described country girl became a woman of the world, a transformation that in its deeper, more intimately mysterious registers remains out of reach of this movie and of the hard-working Ms. Knightley. Mostly, he suggests, an intoxicatingly free world was waiting for Colette; all she had to do was discover it. Her entry comes through Willy (a.k.a. Henry Gauthier-Villars), a witty libertine with a Van Dyke beard and a voracious appetite for society, women and fame.Willy could have been, maybe should have been monstrous, but he’s irresistible here, which perhaps speaks truthfully to his complicated relationship with Colette (and, by extension, to some old-fashioned heterosexual ties). A writer whose name was a brand, Willy published reams, using ghostwriters generously. In the movie, the flat in which he and Colette live is a bustling blur, a literary factory that Willy runs while barking orders — Mr. West’s amusing, emphatic delivery turns Willy’s every utterance into self-promotion — as employees come and go, delivering manuscripts and demanding (late) payment.ImageThe film shows how Colette, played by Ms. Knightley, became a woman of the world.CreditRobert Viglasky/Bleecker StreetIt’s against this backdrop that Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette becomes just Colette, a transition that Willy hastens, including by lying about his serial infidelities. The untruths put a wedge between the couple that devastates Colette yet also liberates her. Willy also runs out of ghostwriters — his expensive habits drain his resources — so turns to the only person left in sight: his wife. Colette resists, he pushes her, she resists some more and he locks her up in a room. Voilà! A new, natural writer is born, scratching beauty, truth and lies on the page. (Although she speaks in English, she, distractingly, writes in French.)The movie’s chronicle of Colette’s awakening largely focuses on, and gets its juice from, her relationship with Willy in all its stormy sweep: the love, labor, betrayals and eventually emancipation. One of the paradoxes of Colette’s life of letters is that it begins in captivity, with Willy literally locking her in a room. “Write!” he thunders at her, echoing every editor who’s ever lived. She effectively becomes Willy’s literary slave even as she begins loosening the bonds of their conjugal life one affair at a time, most importantly with Missy, a.k.a. Mathilde de Morny (the appealing Denise Gough), a freethinking noblewoman who dressed as a man.Mr. Westmoreland doesn’t make more of the master-slave dynamic that feeds Colette’s twinned sexual and literary development, perhaps because he wanted to make a liberation story. He has succeeded, at times movingly, even if Colette’s deliverance can seem shaped to 21st-century expectations and norms rather than to fin de siècle complexities and contradictions. The whole thing is too smooth, clean and aspirational. And of course he omits much — more books, more lovers, a neglected daughter and the teenage stepson whom Colette seduced — but with a life this exuberantly full, how could he not?"
"1020","The Sisters Brothers","R",1,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: Blood Is Never Simple in ‘The Sisters Brothers’","This period western features an excellent cast in a story about brotherhood, a violent past and the elusive future.","2018-09-20","2018-09-21","2018-10-20 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/movies/the-sisters-brothers-review-joaquin-phoenix.html,Read the New York Times Review of The Sisters Brothers,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/21/arts/212sistersbrothers/merlin_143993607_b3feeb71-b632-4066-8481-5fec2a2e3245-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"The first time you see Eli and Charlie Sisters, they are raining down death in the night. It’s 1851, somewhere in the Oregon Territory, and the sky is as black as a bottomless well. Voices and gunfire puncture the gloom as Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix) descend, entering a cabin and shooting dead one man after another. By the time the ground is littered with corpses, a nearby barn has caught fire and so has a stable of unfortunate horses. We sure messed that up, Eli ruefully observes as the uneasy antiheroes of “The Sisters Brothers” are swallowed up by darkness.The French director Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet”), making his English-language debut, grabs you quickly in a busily plotted movie that tracks the Sisters as they pursue others. They work for the Commodore (a foreboding Rutger Hauer), an enigmatic kingpin with an apparently limitless number of enemies for Eli and Charlie to hunt down. The sly, smiley Charlie is the Commodore’s favorite and perhaps the movie’s, too, just because killing comes naturally to him. The brothers have an appetite for destruction, but only Eli gets indigestion. Delicately played by Mr. Reilly, who opens up his character one emotion at a time, Eli is a seeming conundrum; he’s also the movie’s ace in the hole.Westerns were made for bloodshed, and “The Sisters Brothers” delivers as expected. After some fussing and narrative table setting — the Commodore makes Charlie the lead man on their next assignment, creating some jokey sibling jostling — the movie settles back down to its deadly business. The brothers are to meet John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a detective the Commodore has hired to track down Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed). It’s unclear what the Commodore wants with Hermann and whether he’s been aggrieved or robbed. Like the audience, Eli has been left in the dark about some details, a shared ignorance that hints where our sympathies should land.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018The mission, as Charlie likes to call the hunt, grows tricky. Adapted for the screen by Mr. Audiard and Thomas Bidegain from the novel by Patrick deWitt, the narrative soon forks. As Charlie and Eli gallop toward gold-rushing California (the movie was shot in Spain and Romania), the story begins to regularly switch over to John and Hermann, who meet in a frontier settlement. John, a gentleman graced with one of Mr. Gyllenhaal’s mysterious accents, has been tracking Hermann but not nearly stealthily enough. Hermann reaches his hand out to John, having assumed that he might have found a kindred spirit, someone with whom he can speak and commune.Hermann guesses right. He and John rapidly join forces, and Eli and Charlie are now pursuing two quarries, not one. Each set of men seems to represent starkly different worlds, as if they were emissaries from civilization and its discontents. John and Hermann speak in soft, measured voices made for drawing-room deliberations. They have stories that emerge vaguely, having gone West like so many others. Western natives, Eli and Charlie behave and speak roughly, their exchanges laced with profanity. The vulgarities never reach the poetically baroque excesses of the HBO show “Deadwood,” but they are vivid enough to put distance between them and genre exemplars like John Wayne.Despite Mr. Audiard’s embrace of contemporary norms that would have been out of place in a Wayne western — the amusingly deployed coarse language, the shots to the head and sprays of blood — he isn’t attempting to rewrite genre in “The Sisters Brothers,” which is one of this movie’s virtues, along with its terrific actors and his sensitive direction of them. Certainly, it doesn’t come across as a self-conscious revisionist western, an often meaningless category that implies that genres remain static or, worse, that latter-day westerns are more complex than earlier ones. Tell it to John Ford, whose career spanned much of the 20th century and whose westerns varied accordingly.For much of the movie, Mr. Audiard instead seems content to play with genre tropes. He lingers on its mud and its blood, making each glisten. He slips in an occasional iris shot and liquid slow motion, and folds in ideas about brotherhood, masculinity and the catastrophic, perhaps unpayable debt exacted by a violent past. Eli and Charlie’s pursuit gives the movie urgency and visual appeal as open vistas give way to snowy mountains, the dirty streets of San Francisco and a wilderness that prospectors are rapidly spoiling. The brothers also visit a saloon where Charlie gets drunk while Eli hires a prostitute (Allison Tolman), but this is no movie for women, who just embroider its edges.In time, Eli and Charlie catch up with John and Hermann, leading to the most sustained pleasurable interlude. A great deal of the movie’s enjoyment comes from its four principals, who work well when paired off but are particularly appealing in a group. After expediently bonding in a gunfight, the four characters settle into a little bit of paradise and an easy camaraderie that suggests what kind of world they could build together. For a while, Charlie, an often voluble, charismatic psychopath, even quiets down, allowing the men to drink, laugh and think about the Utopia that John and Hermann hope to build. They want to build it in Dallas, a dream of a future that is as absurd as it is tragically doomed."

Strong and steady, with long, elegantly tapered fingers. When those fingers hold a cigarette, they convey utter nonchalance; when they grip a pen over sheet music, they embody fierce purpose.I noticed this because Mr. Jones’s hands appear frequently in the frames of “Quincy,” an affectionate and surprisingly comprehensive documentary produced by Netflix and directed by the actor and filmmaker Rashida Jones, who is his daughter, and Alan Hicks.The comprehensiveness is not a surprise because I doubted the filmmakers, but because Mr. Jones’s life and career are far-ranging enough to justify a mini-series. A musician, orchestrator and record producer, Mr. Jones is arguably the connecting tissue among all significant modes of popular music in the 20th century and beyond. Here’s a very brief roster of artists whose work he’s touched: Dinah Washington, Count Basie, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Will Smith.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018You get the idea. Perhaps one reason you could argue that he doesn’t get enough credit is because it might be impossible to give him sufficient credit.As befits a movie directed by a relative, “Quincy” opens on some intimate notes. It is 2015, and Mr. Jones, in his 80s, is experiencing new health challenges. (In the 1970s, as a relatively young man, he survived two brain aneurysms.) He suffers a stroke and goes into a diabetic coma. (“Can you tell me who the president is?” a member of his care team asks Mr. Jones as he’s coming to; “Sarah Palin,” he answers impishly.) While he’s recovering, he’s told that he can no longer drink alcohol. He doesn’t like it, but he complies, and starts physical therapy as well. It’s not long before he’s back on a breakneck schedule, hosting the Montreux Jazz Festival and producing a stage show to commemorate the opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.The movie alternates between the present, with Mr. Jones on the go, and a retrospective of his life and career, narrated by the man himself. His hardscrabble early years on the South Side of Chicago are scary; his triumphs from the earliest points of his career onward are exhilarating; the racism he is obliged to endure throughout is infuriating.As busy and productive as Mr. Jones remains, the contemporary parts of the film often show him looking haunted — by, for instance, his ambivalent feelings toward his mentally ill mother, who abandoned the family early on and reappeared at inopportune moments, and, more often, by memories of friends now departed. So even if you’ve seen it before, the clip of Ray Charles, who died in 2004, singing “My Buddy” to Mr. Jones at the 2001 Kennedy Center Honors is likely to make you cry all over again."

Smith, the then-head of General Motors, to confront him about the company’s abandonment of Mr. Moore’s hometown, Flint, Mich.In his new documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” Mr. Moore, his sense of showmanship not only intact but enhanced by a bigger production budget, fills a water truck with the same supply that’s piped to Flint residents for drinking and bathing.This water is famously polluted with lead (among other toxins), in a yearslong scandal that’s still not come to a satisfactory conclusion. (“No terrorist organization has figured out how to poison an entire American city,” Mr. Moore notes in voice-over. “It took the Michigan Republican Party to pull that off.”) He drives the truck to the home of the most powerful Republican in Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, and waters his lawn with it.For Mr. Moore, the situation in Flint is a microcosm of the disaster he sees President Trump imposing on this country.The movie begins with a 2016 election “how did this happen?” montage, making clear that the cycle of instant news followed by the internet’s instant reaction has diluted the immediacy of Mr. Moore’s canny cinematic storytelling — it was a lot of stuff I’d heard and seen before.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018But Mr. Moore recognizes an affinity he shares with the president — also a showman. So he is in a nearly unique position to shame the viewer with a frank perspective on how Mr. Trump used his extrovert side to make citizens complacent about the less savory aspects of his character.Mr. Trump has “always committed his crimes in plain sight,” Mr. Moore says in the film. He alludes to accounts challenging his business practices and highlighting his expressions of bigotry. And yet while Mr. Trump starred in “The Apprentice,” Mr. Moore continues, “nobody wrote in to NBC to ask for the removal of an overt racist” from its airwaves.This moment jolted me. As a nearly lifelong New Yorker, I had long been someone who shrugged off Mr. Trump’s words and actions for decades, believing he was just a bad joke that the city was inflicting on the rest of the world.And so here we are.“Fahrenheit 11/9” has a structure of peaks and valleys. There is an abundance of “America is screwed” material. The sections on the Flint water scandal are infuriating. The “he was robbed” threnody for Bernie Sanders is considerably less compelling, but it raises valid points.Relief arrives with “but there’s hope!” scenes, which depict insurgent Democrats like the congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and young activists like the Parkland school shooting survivors Emma González and David Hogg. They’re Mr. Moore’s idea of The Solution. Democratic Party elites like Bill and Hillary Clinton and this newspaper, which Mr. Moore considers an epitome of gutless centrism, are, among others, part of The Problem.The version of the movie I saw had no end credits, and according to a publicist at the screening, Mr. Moore is tinkering with the movie still. The cut screened for me and other critics ended with a contrived but emotionally effective coup de théâtre that dares the viewer to call it cheap. But the more I flirted with the dare, the more plausible Mr. Moore’s dramatic speculation felt. He’s still got it in the showmanship department."

Instead of following through on his daughters’ plans and moving to a retirement home from his house of 50 years, he absconds on a sudden trip to Lodz, Poland, to keep a promise to a close boyhood friend.Because modern travel is fairly quick, the writer and director, Pablo Solarz, who was partly inspired by his grandfather, must find ways to sidetrack his protagonist. Abraham’s money is stolen from a hostel in Madrid, forcing him to make amends with a daughter (Natalia Verbeke) who lives in the city. (They’ve been on bad terms since an incident in which he sought her flattery, and she played Cordelia to his Lear.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018Later, Abraham wants to take a train from Paris to Warsaw without passing through a centimeter of Germany. When he learns that’s impossible, he insists on crossing the country without setting foot on the ground, despite the fact that he needs to change trains there.Abraham’s ostensibly endearing cantankerousness — he has a habit of haggling over prices, a would-be quirky character detail that feeds into a nasty stereotype — becomes increasingly trivializing as we learn more about the horrors he witnessed. And “The Last Suit” is not the sort of movie that would allow him to arrive in Lodz with only the dead awaiting him."

The cheeky opener is an apt mood-setter, even if it does not — cannot, perhaps — adequately prepare you for the gory twists and turns to come in the writer-director Sam Levinson’s black comedy.Lily (Odessa Young), Bex (Hari Nef), Sarah (Suki Waterhouse) and Em (Abra) form a circle of high school girlfriends in the small town of Salem. This foursome is hip and feminist with a capital, bold-typed F; we know this because they chat frankly about their frustrations with the patriarchy and boyfriends who are sexually disappointing. (Using colorful language in one early scene, Em refers to men who do not perform oral sex as “sociopaths.”) Younger, more disillusioned (and privileged) versions of Abbi and Ilana from “Broad City” may come to mind.ImageFrom left, Abra, Odessa Young, Hari Nef and Suki Waterhouse in ""Assassination Nation.""CreditMonica Lek/Neon/AGBOI’ll add some trigger warnings of my own: blunt exposition, familiar meditations on privacy and the corrosive nature of social media, the now shopworn employment of neon lighting. Lily’s voice-over narration frequently spells out the societal pressures of young womanhood in a cool, detached affect. An American flag hovers ominously during multiple ultra violent moments. Often it feels like reading a Twitter thread of ideas and hashtags, rather than watching a movie.Yet the final act, a “Purge”-like blood bath to the tune of vengeance, is aesthetically arresting, including a masterfully suspenseful home invasion sequence. As the town hunts for the offending hacker, Mr. Levinson mostly ditches the dissertation and renders the defamation and destruction of women’s bodies and characters through over-the-top action.It is difficult to watch, but feels true to the spirit of the cultural climate, in which women are routinely shamed and silenced for outspokenness, or simply existing. Even if Lily and her friends feel more like social justice avatars than fully realized characters, by the end of the film, it’s hard not to root for them."

Even at two-and-a-half hours there’s a lot of skimming over details and more than a little grandstanding, as well as numerous languid shots of the dashing 24-year-old general and his swooning devotees. “He leaves a heartbroken girl in every town,” one admirer helpfully informs another.Given the straightforward script, Mr. Avelino’s performance is as understated as perhaps possible, while Gwen Zamora, as del Pilar’s main love interest, Remedios, helps generate some romantic tension as the final fight approaches. That extended, well-staged recreation of the 1899 Battle of Tirad Pass wraps things up on an especially strong note as enemies attack, bullets whiz by and del Pilar finds his courage.Jerrold Tarog, the director, follows the same game plan as he did in “Heneral Luna,” with sweeping music and proud speeches (he wrote the script with Rody Vera). There are also some nice images of the lush Philippine countryside and of del Pilar’s troops. For sure, there’s quite a bit of prettiness here. In this war, apparently, it was just as important to look good as to fight well."

There he met Jennifer Laude, a Filipino transgender woman, and went to a hotel room with her. Ms. Laude was later found murdered, and Mr. Pemberton was arrested and charged with the crime.While the facts were relatively straightforward, the aftermath soon became maddeningly complicated, as seen in “Call Her Ganda,” which followed the resulting trial and the anger it raised in the Philippines.The documentary, directed by PJ Raval, delves into frictions between the two countries and raises questions over the Visiting Forces Agreement, which protects accused American service personnel and is said to have allowed past crimes to go unpunished. Military influence on the case and widespread transgender discrimination made some Filipinos wary that Ms. Laude’s murder would go unpunished.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 17, 2018Mr. Raval effectively captures the sense of outrage surrounding the events. Yet time spent on location shots and repetitive scenes could have been better used to explore Ms. Laude’s life, of which we learn little. A trip to Mr. Pemberton’s hometown is equally cursory, with meager effort seemingly spent looking for those who knew him or were with him on the night of the killing.Yet even with these shortcomings, “Call Her Ganda” (“ganda” means “beautiful” in Tagalog) remains commendable for its focus on the case, and for its insistence that the crime against Ms. Laude not be forgotten. “My life has value,” Ms. Laude once declared. She was right, and this film takes that truth to heart."

Set in 1992, this offbeat, continually intriguing family-recriminations drama, directed by Ari Gold, centers on Ollie (Rory Culkin), a record collector who, with a friend, Nikolai (Robert Sheehan), makes a furtive trip to his family’s lakefront summer home in upstate New York. Months earlier, Ollie’s father committed suicide in the icy lake.Ollie’s goal is to recover — well, steal — a family treasure, a unique 78 r.p.m. of a big-band standard said to be recorded by Cole Porter’s lover at Ollie’s grandparents’ wedding. (The song, “Sway Lake,” is original to the movie, the contribution of Mr. Gold’s twin brother, Ethan.) Soon enough, that grandmother, Charlie (Mary Beth Peil), arrives with her servant, Marlena (Elizabeth Peña, who died in 2014), with business to attend to. That includes secretly looking for the record.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018The record isn’t the only thing unburied. As the characters spill their longings and regrets, “The Song of Sway Lake” shows it has a fair amount on its mind about class and how cherished locations change over time.Ollie and Nikolai’s summer antics — particularly Ollie’s efforts to romance a purple-haired college student (Isabelle McNally) — come from a comparatively conventional coming-of-age movie but mesh reasonably well with the pretensions toward Eugene O’Neill. The film seems unclear on how to unpack all its baggage, but the sense of detail and place carry the day."

By the 1980s, she faded from public view and at the age of 42, died from cancer. “Love, Gilda” is a very affectionate reminder of her brief and brilliant career, a heartfelt love letter whose title might be more accurate without the comma.One could easily imagine a juicy, gossipy version of this movie that digs into the debauched world of “Saturday Night Live” in the 1970s. Or a headier approach that makes the argument for Ms. Radner as a comedic genius. Her life could also easily be shoehorned into a sad clown narrative that juxtaposes her joyous public self with her struggles with bulimia and cancer.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018The director Lisa D’Apolito takes an all-of-the-above approach, to mixed results, an entertaining portrait more comfortable skating the surface than digging deep. After a quick spin through Ms. Radner’s well-off 1950s childhood in Detroit, Ms. D’Apolito covers the performer’s major break starring in a Canadian production of “Godspell” with a wonderful audio clip of her improvising with a young Martin Short. Where the movie succeeds best is as an illumination of her charm and spirit. Ms. Radner played eccentric characters with raucous abandon and jangly big-kid physicality, but she also projected a vulnerability that made you care for them. The movie explores some of her insecurities, particularly with regard to her eating disorder, but its tone never strays too far from the light and breezy.“Love, Gilda” belongs to a booming genre of comedian documentaries, and unlike recent examples about Rose Marie and Gilbert Gottfried, it suffers from the absence of an interview with its subject. And it doesn’t have the ambition of Judd Apatow’s probing portrait of Garry Shandling.Much of its “Saturday Night Live” coverage seems familiar, and its treatment of her marriage with Gene Wilder is tentative.Comedy nerds might find the description of her work after “S.N.L.” most illuminating, including footage of her Broadway show as well as her appearance as herself on “The Garry Shandling Show” that made comedy out of her disease decades before Tig Notaro turned a raw discussion of her diagnosis into an acclaimed comedy special. When Mr. Shandling’s character asked her why she had been away from television for a few years, Ms. Radner said: “Oh, I had cancer,” adding, “what did you have?”"

This screen version of a celebrated 1973 book by John Bellairs doesn’t have the sophistication of an adaptation like “Hugo,” but no film in which Cate Blanchett head-butts a vivified jack-o’-lantern could be entirely without merit.The movie has the pleasingly demented texture of early Tim Burton. It bears the logo of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin company and is seen from a Spielbergian child’s-eye view. After the deaths of his parents, Lewis (Owen Vaccaro) goes to live with his uncle, Jonathan (Jack Black), secretly a benevolent warlock. Jonathan is obsessed with finding a clock hidden in the house by its previous magic-dabbling occupant (Kyle MacLachlan). Lewis asks to apprentice.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018CreditCreditQuantrell D. Colbert/Universal StudiosThe pleasures of the movie are mainly in the design of the Victorian house and its grounds, replete with a chair that behaves like a dog, and in the affection for re-creating the 1950s period, down to a surprise use for Ovaltine. Mr. Black is perhaps too sardonic a presence, but Ms. Blanchett — as a fellow spell-caster — takes evident pleasure in deadpanning lines like “I melted Salvador Dalí’s watch once, right off his wrist.” Playing material like this with conviction is its own form of magic."

In “Life Itself” the parental slaughter is downright wanton. Mothers and fathers are hit by buses, perish in car accidents, commit suicide and succumb to cancer. You wouldn’t exactly call it carelessness, since all the bereavement seems to have been arranged with meticulous care. Maybe “misfortune” is the right word after all, though more for the audience than the various orphaned children.The first of these is Abby (Olivia Wilde) whose parents have the discretion to perish offscreen, and whom we first encounter snuggling with her husband, Will (Oscar Isaac), arguing about the merits of a particular Bob Dylan album. (It’s “Time Out of Mind” if you really want to know). Actually, we meet Will first, ranting and raving and weeping and wailing in a coffee shop and in his therapist’s office, his actions explained by the voice-over narration of Samuel L. Jackson. Mr. Jackson’s presence — like Annette Bening’s as the therapist — is a red herring and kind of a cheat. For a few minutes the movie pretends to be a lot more fun than it really is.ImageÀlex Monner, left, and Antonio Banderas in another scene from the film.CreditJose Haro/Amazon StudiosTo be honest, a plot summary would make “Life Itself” sound like fun, because it might create an impression of antic preposterousness. The story flashes back to Will and Abby meeting in college, jumps sidewise to a visit to Will’s parents (Jean Smart and Mandy Patinkin) and then leaps across the Atlantic from Manhattan to Spain, where Antonio Banderas tells a sad story while gazing at a glass of sherry. Horrible things happen — bus accident, cancer, etc. — but the mood throughout is of woozy wonder. Isn’t it amazing how human destinies intertwine? This movie seems intent on persuading you that the answer is “no.”Abby’s college thesis is on the concept of the unreliable narrator. With charming undergraduate fervor, she breathlessly explains to Will that the ultimate unreliable narrator is “life.” To be fair to “Life Itself,” the thesis is a failure, but the movie retains quite a lot of Abby’s apparent confusion about what stories are and how they work. Unreliability is a fascinating and tricky conceit for novelists and filmmakers. It should not be confused with bad writing.There is a lot of that here, and also, to confuse matters further, a lot of good acting. It is poignant and sometimes weirdly thrilling to watch Mr. Isaac, Ms. Wilde and the other cast members — I should also mention Laia Costa and Sergio Peris-Mencheta, though they might prefer that I didn’t — commit with such fervor and seriousness to such utter balderdash. Their efforts and the soft-and-shiny, sun-drenched look of Brett Pawlak’s cinematography might fool the inattentive into mistaking “Life Itself” for a good movie."

Informative but not overwhelming, it blends biography and appreciative analysis in 90 brisk, packed minutes. Visual artists are especially good subjects for this kind of documentary, and still images like Winogrand’s — mostly black-and-white, full of latent drama and arrested kineticism — lend themselves to cinematic contemplation.Though the pictures were printed to fit on the pages of books and the film is destined for public television, it gains something on the big screen (for example at Film Forum, where it opens Wednesday): a sense of sweep and detail, a soupçon of epic, a hint of Hollywood swagger. It’s not quite right to say that Winogrand himself, who died in 1984, comes across as larger than life. It’s more that he belonged to a time when life itself might have seemed bigger, and art more replete with heroic possibilities than in our own anxious, cautious time.That might be a myth of course, and “Garry Winogrand,” directed by Sasha Waters Freyer, follows the American Masters template in burnishing the artist’s legend, even as it also brings a gently skeptical perspective to bear on his achievements. Winogrand, a New Yorker whose most famous photographs record the life of his native city, is sometimes likened to Norman Mailer, and he manifests — in a few audio and video recordings and in the fond memories of old friends — a similarly brash, reckless masculinity. (Though without the same degree of pugilistic aggression or creative waywardness that marred both Mailer’s reputation and his oeuvre.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 10, 2018Out in the world with his camera, Winogrand was in constant motion, fiddling with lenses and settings, shuffling and bending to find interesting angles, snapping the shutter and advancing the film with a trigger finger as fast as any Western gunslinger’s. Though the results recall an earlier age — a cityscape of men in hats and women in curlers, of rounded city buses and orderly retail window displays — he is proposed as a prophet of the digital age, when everyone with a smartphone is a potential street photographer.Asked if he used “available light,” Winogrand responded: “What other kind is there?” The same might be said of technology. In the middle and later decades of the 20th century, taking pictures got progressively easier, but processing the images still required long hours in the darkroom. Winogrand, as he moved from New York to Texas and then to California, always preferred to be outdoors, and as a result he left behind thousands of undeveloped rolls and contact sheets that hadn’t been winnowed for prints.The sheer volume of his later (or “posthumous”) output is one of the problems Ms. Freyer’s subjects contemplate. There is also the supposed slippage in quality between his New York and California photographs, a notion advanced by John Szarkowski, the Museum of Modern Art curator who helped put Winogrand on the map in the ‘60s. Older debates about the status of documentary photography among the fine arts also resurface — debates that Winogrand, along with Diane Arbus and Lee Friedlander, decisively settled — along with newer concerns about gender and representation.In 1975, Winogrand published “Women are Beautiful,” a book that remains controversial (or as we prefer to say nowadays, problematic). Ms. Freyer’s handling of it is exemplary and revealing. A handful of critics and curators offer analyses of the book’s sexual politics that are thoughtful and respectful, but also pointed in their attention to power, objectification and sexual inequality in public space. In response, there is some sputtering about political correctness and thought police, which tends to be the reaction to even the most judicious and sympathetic acts of feminist criticism.“Garry Winogrand” deserves great credit for staging that argument, and for balancing candor and discretion in its glimpses of Winogrand’s sometimes disorderly personal life. It doesn’t suppose that you could separate the art from the artist, not least because the artist was always insistently and physically present, looked at by many of his subjects even as he looked at them from beyond the frame. He was, to quote Philip Larkin’s summary of an imaginary biographer’s assessment of him, “one of those old-type natural fouled-up guys,” and one who could find endless and various beauty in a messed-up world."

It wasn’t just the combination of aesthetically apposite sounds and images, but a personal association — that music has moved me for many decades.The movie, directed by Panos Cosmatos from a script he wrote with Aaron Stewart-Ahn (I should disclose here that Mr. Stewart-Ahn is an acquaintance) is a fantasy feature awash in physical and emotional violence. In its various genre allusions, it draws from a deep, idiosyncratic well. But despite its frequent instances of absurdist humor, it is not a film that winks at the audience with its cleverness.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 17, 2018CreditCreditRLJE FilmsSet in the early 1980s in a world rather, but not entirely, like our own, “Mandy” tells the story of a couple, Red (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), living at a far remove from society. Mandy is abducted by a cult, led by Jeremiah Sands (Linus Roache), who can actually summon demons. She meets an awful fate, and Red, possessed by grief and rage, becomes her bloody avenger.These days, I find the narrative convention of the abducted and violated woman unappetizing. In defense of its use here, I believe that Mr. Cosmatos treats the horrific events with sincere gravity and without male-gaze sadism. Ms. Riseborough creates a character both ethereal and defiant; Mr. Roache channels the character actor Richard Lynch and the rock star Alice Cooper to create a villain both ludicrous and shudder-worthy. And Mr. Cage uses his outsize-performance chops with remarkable focus and commitment.The movie’s imagery is consistently unearthly; its pacing has a magisterial weight. Call it pulp Tarkovsky, maybe."

Neither city nor country, suburbia — at least in the imagination of too many novelists, filmmakers and songwriters to count — yokes affluence to alienation. Beyond the well-kept lawns and hedges are seething hives of adultery, anomie and addiction. These pathologies may not actually be more common along the commuter rail lines than anywhere else, but there is an imposing body of literature that insists otherwise.Nicole Holofcener’s “The Land of Steady Habits,” adapted from a Cheeveresque novel of the same name by Ted Thompson, revisits this well-trodden territory, focusing on a familiar type of character. Anders Hill, played with wobbly, tongue-tied charm by Ben Mendelsohn, is a middle-aged former “finance guy” in Westport, Conn., who has walked out on his job and his marriage for the usual vague, existentially urgent and ethically dubious reasons.ImageLost and looking in suburbia: Ben Mendelsohn playing a sad Connecticut dad in the Cheeveresque “The Land of Steady Habits.”CreditAlison Rosa/NetflixLeaving his gracious old colonial in the care of his ex-wife, Helene (Edie Falco), Anders says that he has decided to give “condo living” a try. To feather his bachelor nest, he wanders through retail stores soliciting decorating tips from women — customers and salespeople alike — and then sleeping with them. It doesn’t seem like much fun, for him or his partners, but it’s a way of passing the time.Anders may have quit the rat race, but he can’t seem to stay away from the track. He goes to parties where he runs into Helene, and pursues awkward conversations with old friends who are less than delighted to be in his company. Helene has moved on to a new man (Bill Camp), which bothers Anders more than he would like to admit. He tries to maintain a semblance of paternal authority with his drifting, post-collegiate son, Preston (Thomas Mann), and indulges in some desperate adolescent behavior with another young man, Charlie (Charlie Tahan), who takes a lot of drugs.Nobody seems to like Anders all that much, and he doesn’t really care. He acts less like a man in free fall than like a guy who’s got it all figured out, which has the effect of making him at once pitiable, infuriating and kind of mysterious. Maybe he is privy to some kind of esoteric knowledge. Or maybe he’s just a shallow jerk embracing his true identity.Since this is not “American Beauty,” Anders’s privileged turmoil doesn’t become a gaseous metaphor for a filmmaker’s half-baked sociological insights. “The Land of Steady Habits” is a Nicole Holofcener movie — her first feature since “Enough Said” in 2013 (and her first ever without Catherine Keener in the cast) — which is to say a funny, sweet-and-sour study in envy, cruelty, bad decision-making and forgiveness. Ms. Holofcener, for more than two decades one of the sharpest anatomists of upper-middle-class American life, is more interested in the idiosyncrasies of behavior and the texture of specific relationships than in easy generalities. So even though Anders and the people around him can be sorted into recognizable types (a fault, mostly of Mr. Thompson’s book), they are also amusing and awful in ways that can feel disconcertingly real.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 6, 2018“The Land of Steady Habits” (Connecticut’s longstanding unofficial nickname) is not only Anders’s story, though his self-centeredness can make it feel that way. As he stumbles toward either a bright new beginning or a total flameout — the first foreshadowed by a tentative romance with Barbara (Connie Britton), the second by his age-inappropriate semi-friendship with Charlie — other lives are illuminated, and also singed, by his wayward comet’s path. His blithe clumsiness contributes to, and directly causes, a lot of hurt, visited especially on the next generation. Middle-aged guys may muddle through, but young men like Preston and Charlie risk losing their way, and even their lives.The darkness and pain haunting Westport are more pronounced — and maybe for that reason less affecting — than the melancholy and quiet rage that figure in Ms. Holofcener’s other movies. The suburban setting is acutely rendered, but it also feels a little secondhand, with not as much room for invention and oddness than the New York and Los Angeles of “Lovely and Amazing,” “Friends with Money” and “Please Give.”But within these constraints, the performances have sufficient grit — and the writing has just enough polish — to make “The Land of Steady Habits” feel unpredictable and fresh. Mr. Mendelsohn, who looks and speaks as if he were perpetually sucking on a cough drop, makes no overt gestures either in the direction of likability or awfulness. Anders can be thoughtless and casually cruel (after sex with Barbara, for example), and he can also be affable and honest. That it’s hard to tell the difference is a credit to the actor, who all but dares us to give up on the character altogether.And the film’s strength is that it holds this out as a real possibility, taking seriously the proposition that redemption may be out of reach. In most versions of the suburban male midlife crisis story, the protagonist comes by our sympathy as if it were a birthright or a secular manifestation of grace. In Ms. Holofcener’s secular, implicitly feminist revision, Anders has no such entitlement. He’s stuck with himself, as everyone else — the audience included — is stuck with him. We make the best of it, and in this case “the best” is a very fine movie."

The particularity and power of the larger cinematic image he has created through a multiplicity of moments are impossible to adequately describe in critical prose.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018The movie is both a narrative of real lives and an inquiry. Text that appears onscreen early on states that the filmmaker (who also has cinematography, editing, writing and producing credits) wanted to “figure out how we came to be seen.” The “we” being African-Americans.Hale County, Ala., is where Walker Evans documented in photographs the lives of white sharecroppers in the Depression era; Evans, with the writer James Agee, created the still-moving book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” Mr. Ross shows a different disenfranchised community, homing in on three individuals: Daniel and Quincy, high school ballplayers, one of whom makes his way to college, and Boosie, the mother of Quincy’s children. Mr. Ross, who’s also a photographer, met his subjects while working as a teacher and basketball coach in the county of the movie’s title.The challenges these young people face here are not documented by means of dramatic situations or confrontations. Sometimes one of the subjects will address the camera, speaking of hopes and fears; other times they’ll just go about their business, quietly. At one point a title card drolly reads “Carrying twins now, Boosie careth not about the film.” The twins are delivered, in a scene as low-key as anything else in the movie. When tragedy strikes, Mr. Ross retains a patient and focused eye. His camera’s gaze has a quality of reserve, one that insistently imparts respect to his subjects.ImageDaniel Collins, a basketball player and one of the film's main subjects.CreditRaMell Ross/Cinema GuildImageQuincy Bryant, one of two basketball players featured in the film.CreditRaMell Ross/Cinema GuildThe reason this seems to be crucial to him is conveyed in a scene in which his camera tracks up a dirt road, approaching what looks like a plantation mansion. Mr. Ross intercuts the camera’s progress with black-and-white shots of the black vaudevillian Bert Williams, who  frequently performed in blackface. Looking at something off screen, Williams appears to be admiring the mansion. The effect is bitter, trenchant. Mr. Ross moves on from this observation as if shaking himself off from a bad mood or dream. In the yard, a laborer is burning old tires, and Mr. Ross is compelled to shoot the smoke as it travels past the treetops and is pierced by sunlight.The filmmaker’s poetic logic is inextricable from his consciousness of race and community, and of his function and potential as an artist grappling with his own circumstances and those of the people he’s depicting. “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” is not a long film, but it contains whole worlds."

The crunchy power chords, the pummeling rhythm section — it’s all conventionally head-banging.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018But the earliest post-Pistols musical efforts of Johnny Rotten (also known by his real name John Lydon) — the band’s lead vocalist and architect of punk iconography — did not then, and never will, sound like classic rock. “The Public Image Is Rotten,” a documentary directed by Tabbert Fiiller, has some valuable insights into how the spectacular 1979 album variously known as “Metal Box” and “Second Edition” was made by Mr. Lydon’s band Public Image Ltd. But it is mostly a portrait of Mr. Lydon, now 62 and still a witty, mercurial figure fascinated by commercial fame and constantly wrestling with the challenge of making viable art within that framework.This documentary doesn’t get too wonky about the process by which the masterpiece “Metal Box,” and subsequent mixed-bag records, was achieved, but it does chronicle juicy clashes between Mr. Lydon and his former colleagues Jah Wobble, Keith Levene and Martin Atkins, all of whom get a say in the proceedings. As do subsequent Public Image enablers, the protean producer and bassist Bill Laswell and the genuine classic rock drummer Ginger Baker — Mr. Lydon’s roster of collaborators over the decades has been eclectic. Even if you’ve scratched your head over Mr. Lydon’s TV ad work and other efforts to maintain a professional life in recent years, this affectionate and frank movie can elicit newfound admiration for a slightly mellowed iconoclast."

That robbery is reconstructed in “Museo,” Alonso Ruizpalacios’s new film, but not quite in the usual based-on-a-true-story heist-movie manner. Slow-moving and grand, with lush music and elegant wide-screen compositions, it feels less like a thriller than a poetic, intermittently comic meditation on beauty, history and middle-class disaffection.The crime is the work not of a gang of criminal geniuses, but of a pair of underachieving suburban 20-somethings — Wilson (Leonardo Ortizgris), the narrator and sidekick, and Juan (Gael García Bernal), the mastermind. They live in Satellite City, a modern development dominated by stark, brightly colored towers. Juan chafes under the disapproving authority of his father (Alfredo Castro), a doctor, and squabbles with his siblings. He’s obnoxious and thoughtless, the kind of guy who ruins Christmas by telling his little nieces and nephews where the presents are hidden.Wilson, a nervous, sensitive fellow whose mustache somehow has the effect of undermining the machismo it’s meant to enhance, is a classic follower. He would absolutely jump off a bridge if Juan told him to, but he’d have a lot of questions and hesitations before making the leap. What’s remarkable, at least at first, is how easy the caper turns out to be. In the absence of motion detectors or effective security cameras, all that’s required is a modicum of stealth and coordination, and a priceless bundle of cultural patrimony vanishes into the night.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018The problem is what to do with the loot. Once the robbery makes the news, it sparks public outrage and indignation, not least from Juan’s father. The boys head south, connecting with a tour guide at a Maya pyramid (Bernardo Velasco) who arranges a meeting with a British collector (Simon Russell Beale). This section of “Museo” is a bouncy, farcical road trip, but it also deepens the film’s slyly patriotic subtext. The story of a pair of clumsy criminals becomes a pretext for celebrating the beauty and complexity of Mexico’s landscape and history.Mr. Ruizpalacios’s first feature, “Güeros,” set during the student protests of the late 1990s and shot in austere black and white, was also about young people revolting against the banality of their lives and trying to take hold of something noble and grand. Such gestures of rebellion may be futile, even ridiculous, and both “Museo” and “Güeros” note the silliness and self-delusions of their characters.But as comically clueless as Wilson and Juan may be, they aren’t held up for easy, cynical ridicule. Juan’s attraction to the antiquities he covets isn’t motivated only by boredom or greed, but also by a sense of their mystical power. This is particularly true of the green jade mask, an object that the film regards as almost magical.And in spite of a meandering story and some fuzzy passages, there is a touch of magic in “Museo,” a sense of wonder and curiosity that imparts palpable excitement. Some of that is the intimation of a strong and original cinematic voice evolving toward the realization of its full potential — the feeling that you might be in the presence of someone who could become the next great Mexican filmmaker."
"1200","A Simple Favor","R",0,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: Smother Mother Meets Femme Fatale in ‘A Simple Favor’","In his latest, Paul Feig directs Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively in a light-and-dark comedy about two mothers, murderous secrets and complicating lies.","2018-09-13","2018-09-14","2018-10-13 16:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/movies/simple-favor-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of A Simple Favor,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/arts/14simplefavor-1/14simplefavor-1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Sly and sweet with an acid finish, “A Simple Favor” is a female-friendship comedy with neo-noir ambitions. Anna Kendrick stars as Stephanie, a widow raising her young son in a chilly Connecticut suburb. From her tidy, bright kitchen festooned with children’s drawings, she regularly hosts a self-produced internet program. Stephanie’s pitching recipes and positivity with a smile, but mostly she’s peddling aspirational motherhood, which, with longer hemlines, might easily veer into “Handmaid’s Tale” territory. She doesn’t have many followers (or much of anyone), but then she’s mostly addressing an audience of one: herself.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018Her viewership increases at an impressive, predictable, perhaps meaningful clip soon after she announces on her program that her new friend, Emily (Blake Lively), has gone missing. In gumshoe fashion, Stephanie recounts what happened, how and why, rewinding the story in an extended flashback. She and Emily meet through their sons, who attend the same school where a troika of gargoyles (Andrew Rannells, Aparna Nancherla and Kelly McCormack) mock Stephanie’s anxious parenting. It’s no surprise that she instantly takes to Emily, who emerged Venus-like one rainy day to shine her radiance on Stephanie.The women cozy up to each other, or anyway Stephanie falls hard. Prodded by their sons, they arrange a children’s play date at Emily’s sleek modernist lair. As fizzy French pop tunes fill the air and a comically outré painting of a naked Emily watches over them, the women laugh and share over drinks. Stephanie is floored by the other woman’s attention and lifestyle. Emily seems to have it all, or at least a glossy magazine-spread version that also includes a sports car, a fancy city job and an alluring husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a professor and writer whose work Stephanie has actually read.The director Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids”) has fun setting all this up. Working in fast, bold strokes, he creates a lightly cartoonish but recognizable world of bright surfaces, plastic smiles and gleeful backbiting. Despite her cookies and chirpy persona, Stephanie seems uneasy in her own skin, but she soon finds a new focus (other than her son and herself) when she sees Emily slink out of a Porsche in stilettos and a peekaboo pinstripe suit, hair cascading from beneath a rakish black fedora. Like Fred MacMurray’s weak-kneed patsy in “Double Indemnity,” Emily is thunderstruck by one of those noir blondes who could easily prove fatal.ImageMs. Kendrick, whose character has a self-produced internet program from her kitchen.CreditPeter Iovino/LionsgateEverything about Stephanie and Emily — clothing, homes, attitude — underscores the yawning divide between them, which begins inching shut as a friendship forms. In moments, as the Serge Gainsbourg songs play, the temperature teasingly rises, suggesting a closer connection. But then Emily goes missing, and Stephanie and the story turn a sharp corner. The twists and kinks multiply — a shady past surfaces — and the movie seemingly, encouragingly, heads into Gillian Flynn terrain (“Gone Girl,” “Sharp Objects”), where the world and women alike are messy, complex and sometimes brutal. Too bad that this promise also proves aspirational. (Jessica Sharzer wrote the script, from the Darcey Bell novel of the same title.)Mr. Feig handily manages the mood and scene shifts, using regular laughs to brighten the deepening dark. By far his smartest move was to give Ms. Kendrick and Ms. Lively room to create a prickly intimacy for their characters, a bond that’s persuasive enough to push the story through its more forced moments. Even so, despite Mr. Feig and his two well-synchronized stars, “A Simple Favor” starts stalling out as the narrative feints and dodges increase. There are surprises, including a brief turn from Jean Smart. For the most part, though, the drawn-out payoff doesn’t deliver on the story’s setup or its characters’ juicy potential.It would be nice to see Mr. Feig reunite with Ms. Lively and Ms. Kendrick, who pump oxygen into their caricatures. As the adult Mean Girl that everyone falls for at some point, Ms. Lively looks and plays her flashy part convincingly, deploying small seductive smiles that can quickly morph into soul-destroying sneers. She’s good, but the movie belongs to Ms. Kendrick, who takes Stephanie, an Instagram cliché, and turns her into a multitude of women — the sweet smother-mother, the sighingly lonely widow, the wipe-your-feet-on-me doormat — who never think they’re good enough, but who of course are exactly right."

The writer, Sun Yi, told of being imprisoned in a camp in Masanjia, China, where he and others were forced into slave labor. He asked the finder to help expose their plight. Ms. Keith, of Damascus, Ore., took it to The Oregonian newspaper, whose subsequent article was widely read around the world.The journey of that letter, and the tale of Mr. Sun’s detention and torture, is recounted in “Letter From Masanjia,” a potent documentary that pushes the story still further after his release.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018Leon Lee, the director, lives in Canada and couldn’t travel to China because of his previous films, which were critical of the country. He secretly collaborated with Mr. Sun and helped him buy camera equipment that Mr. Sun used to tell of his past and to record his continued harassment by authorities. (Mr. Sun was arrested several times because of his membership in Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that has been outlawed in China.)It’s an important story, made more intense by its tight focus. Mr. Lee uses few additional interviews outside of Ms. Keith and two former guards from the Masanjia labor camp, who corroborate Mr. Sun’s reports. There are no reams of statistics, nor appeals to boycott Chinese-made goods. Instead we’re given a well-told account of one peaceful man’s terrible treatment. That’s more than enough. Animated sequences depicting Mr. Sun’s imprisonment are especially effective.“Justice will prevail over evil,” Mr. Sun says in the film’s closing scene. It’s a hopeful moment, but not an uplifting one. He knows, and so do we, that some movements succeed at the expense of their heroes, whose endings often aren’t happy."

I agree with the filmmaker Amma Asante that their stories should be told. But Ms. Asante’s new film, “Where Hands Touch,” an attempt to tell one such story, is a gut-wrenching misfire.The movie begins in 1944 in idyllic-looking Rüdesheim, in the Rhine Valley. The area’s residents of color included some people who were disparagingly called “Rhineland bastards” — children fathered (supposedly) by French soldiers of African descent who occupied the Rhineland in the aftermath of World War I. Leyna (Amandla Stenberg), about to turn 17, is one of these children. Her single mom, played by Abbie Cornish, is, on one evening, panicked by a visit from the local Gestapo. (The actors playing these goons, who, like almost everyone else in the film speak in English with German accents, sound as if they’ve watched too many episodes of “Hogan’s Heroes.”) The family moves to Berlin, which turns out not to be a great idea. The younger brother is required to join the Hitler Youth, and Leyna, expelled from school, is put to work in a factory with her mother.No matter how much humiliation she’s subjected to, Leyna is determined to assert her German identity. This trait is meant, I suppose, to make the viewer reflect on the James Baldwin quote that appears at the movie’s opening: “There are days when you wonder what your role is in this country and what your future is in it.” But the devices this movie constructs to connect to Baldwin’s thought are insufficient, to say the least.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018As the movie plods on, Leyna meets Lutz (George MacKay), the fresh-faced son of a Nazi bureaucrat who is more gung-ho about Hitler’s crusade than his father is. Their secret romance is cut short when Lutz is sent on an army assignment and Leyna is thrown into a Bavarian labor camp.When I reviewed Ms. Asante’s previous film, “A United Kingdom,” last year, I noted that the writer/director “addresses contemporary concerns via period romance, and her commitment to the romance is not a feint.” She tries to do something similar here, but in this film the commitment to romance is not an illuminating factor, but a fatal miscalculation.A love scene between Leyna and Lutz leans rather far into a notion that while National Socialism might have been devastating for humanity in general, it could do wonders for one teenage girl’s sexual awakening.When Leyna and Lutz are reunited at the labor camp, which is directly across from a smoke-bellowing death camp that’s cremating Jews, the wobbly scenario becomes full-on grotesque. The stridently theatricalized violence is horrific only because it’s so abjectly manipulative. By the end of the movie, my jaw felt unhinged from dropping so often."

The efforts to imbue an extraterrestrial-boogeyman scenario with tidbits about genetics and climate change (and even a hint of “Star Wars,” to which the incidental scoring owes a lot) tend to squelch the menace.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018The 1987 “Predator” had Arnold Schwarzenegger. “The Predator” settles for Boyd Holbrook, playing an elite sniper with a genius son (Jacob Tremblay) on the autism spectrum. Olivia Munn is a scientist who “basically wrote the book on evolutionary biology.”Circumstances bring them together with a group of misfit soldiers (they include Trevante Rhodes and Keegan-Michael Key, who get the best lines). The ostensibly comic scene in which the men meet Ms. Munn’s character — she wakes up after accidentally shooting herself with a tranquilizer dart to find them creepily watching her — leaves a bad aftertaste. (Last week, The Los Angeles Times reported that Fox cut a scene between Ms. Munn and the actor Steven Wilder Striegel after Ms. Munn discovered that Mr. Striegel was a registered sex offender.)The frat house atmosphere eventually gives way to tedious bloodletting.

Or maybe it’s a story that proceeds with one foot firmly in the real world and the other — well, somewhere else entirely.Where that might be is anyone’s guess, but little Siobhan is the first to go there, disappearing from her bed one night in 1986 while her parents sleep. Also vanished is her likeness from a painting by Father Burke (Lalor Roddy), Siobhan’s artistically-inclined parish priest. This we learn from an enigmatic prologue before being whooshed to the present where Melanie (Anna Margaret Hollyman), an American artist, is mounting an exhibition of dioramas based on similarly unsettling Irish legends.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 30, 2018Out of the blue, a summons from a representative of the exiled Father Burke, who wants to commission a new work, brings Melanie to his secluded rural mansion and the tender mercies of his sinister housekeeper (Helena Bereen). Stomach cramps and strange dreams follow dinner; and as her unnerving visions intensify, Melanie suspects her hosts’ intentions might be less than benign.Suspending folklore and nightmare in a slurry of Catholic guilt, the writer and director, Michael Tully, cultivates a woebegone atmosphere and a woozy tone. Ever since his first feature in 2007, the quietly impressive “Cocaine Angel,” his attention to mood over story has been evident. Yet despite the gloomy allure of Wyatt Garfield’s cinematography, “Don’t Leave Home” feels only half-baked. Mr. Tully’s downbeat, dreamy approach to horror is a welcome one, but this time he leaves us with too many tight lips and loose ends."

And right field. And center field, the stands and the dugout, too.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018Set in a desolate small town in New York, the story finds Del (Peter Dinklage) as the survivor of a plague that has apparently killed all other humans. To pass his days he buries the dead, cleans their homes and returns their books to the library, quirky actions meant to create a sense of order in his life. One day, Grace (Elle Fanning) appears, asking lots of questions but offering few answers of her own. After a grudging start, the two become friends.Reed Morano, the director, creates an aching sense of melancholy through shadowy scenes and empty spaces. As the characters quietly go about their days, their solitude becomes palpable. Ms. Morano also helps foster a convincing chemistry between Mr. Dinklage and Ms. Fanning, as well as some dark humor.Yet Mike Makowsky’s script throws in a baffling third act that mixes with the rest of the film the way prune juice mixes with white wine. It’s possible that Mr. Makowsky was reaching for a Lynchian sense of the uncanny (or more likely, overreaching for an allegory). But as written, such a turn can’t be pulled off, even with these exceptional actors. Indeed, as in the world of “I Think We’re Alone Now,” everything was going quite well, right before it all went wrong."

Adam is a Jehovah’s Witness, and blood transfusion runs counter to the religion’s tenets and his parents’ beliefs — and therefore his own.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018Fiona visits him at the hospital before rendering a verdict. The encounter and the decision, and the asymmetries in the consequences for Adam (Fionn Whitehead, from “Dunkirk”) and Fiona, reverberate though the rest of the action.“The Children Act” makes for a more wieldy movie than this year’s earlier “On Chesil Beach,” which Mr. McEwan also adapted from his own book, in that case relying on retaining rhythms and chronological jumps better suited to the page. Here, a beautifully internalized performance from Ms. Thompson and the various efforts to highlight the cinematic potential in Fiona’s anguish — the climax plays out during a piano recital — can’t override the tidy ironies of Mr. McEwan’s design.Fiona is a custodian of children who has no children. She is a gifted listener, yet is too professional and emotionally guarded to truly hear what Adam has to say. And as Fiona’s husband (Stanley Tucci) puts it, in a blunt statement of themes, Fiona is an authority on family problems who neglects to address her own. Yet the movie finally punts on grappling with its ambiguities. The finale feels functional rather than haunting."

Their projects promise to revolutionize aeronautics, arsenic testing, vaccinations and neurological research. The authors of this research are all high school students.The documentary filmmakers, Cristina Costantini and Darren Foster, take a microscope to the same convention that inspired this year’s “Inventing Tomorrow,” and like that film, they introduce audiences to exceptional students from across the globe. Adorably, “Science Fair” finds its teenage subjects as interested in trap music as they are in innovation.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018As the rare class clown among this sweetly earnest bunch, one student, Robbie, is fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning. The problem he identifies is that algorithms can produce language, but the process of how or why computers make their decisions is unknown even to coders. With a wide grin, he explains that his project is a machine-learning algorithm that tracks how machines learn.If there is a criticism to be made of the unfailingly charming “Science Fair,” it is that, like Robbie’s opaque algorithms, the film displays its subjects’ spectacular achievements without showing the logic of how they reach their conclusions. There are brief explanations given to the mechanics of each project, but the film is wedded to layman’s terminology at the expense of clarity. Social science is also largely absent from the film, as the directors choose to focus on the triumphs of individuals rather than the circumstances that make it possible for these individuals to excel. Thanks to its lovable subjects, “Science Fair” nails the presentation, but its research is only surface deep."

That much is clear in “American Chaos,” a documentary whose maker caught a whiff of Donald J. Trump’s early momentum and set out to interview some of his supporters in the months before Nov. 8, 2016.That filmmaker, James D. Stern, was perplexed by a growing number of people backing Mr. Trump. Camera in hand, he spoke with Cuban immigrants in Florida, coal miners in West Virginia, a rancher in Arizona and others, at least one of whom said he twice voted for Barack Obama. Mr. Stern attended the Republican National Convention, and returned to Florida for election night.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018It was a prescient plan. Mr. Stern, a longtime Democrat, vowed to listen closely, and he seems to have kept his word. Though he doesn’t mask his expressions — usually astounded, though never mocking — he’s a genial interviewer, empathic, he says, even if he can’t be sympathetic.Most frequently, his interviewees voice disdain for a system they feel isn’t working for them. If, like Mr. Stern, you can’t fathom voting as they did, it’s possible to at least understand some of their emotions. (Though perhaps not those people whom we hear denying the facts of climate change, or those whose hatred of Hillary Clinton veers toward the pathological.)Ultimately, “American Chaos” does little more than recap what’s already been said over the past two years. Yet like “11/8/16,” another recent documentary about the election, it gives a voice to many who are routinely ignored. “Passion beats pragmatism,” Mr. Stern says, summing up what he sees on his travels. Indeed, the message here is the same for both sides, for elections to come: Those who harness that passion gain the power."

At least, that’s how it feels for much of its running time, as its multinational characters wander sedately around an ornate mansion (played by a house in Yonkers, N.Y.) belonging to the vice president of an unnamed South American country.The glamorous crowd has gathered for a private performance by the celebrated soprano Roxane Coss (Julianne Moore), an event intended as a lure for her superfan Hosokawa (the wonderful Ken Watanabe), a wealthy Japanese industrialist and hoped-for investor in the country’s development plans. But barely have the guests sampled the canapés and the opening notes of her aria than a guerrilla group arrives to take them hostage and demand the release of its imprisoned comrades.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018This brief flurry of action settles all too soon into a lengthy state of siege as guests and rebels mingle uneasily and negotiations are conducted almost entirely off camera. A Red Cross intermediary (Sebastian Koch) flits in and out to remind us there’s life beyond the compound, but otherwise there’s little sense of time passing or international outrage. If the Americans and Japanese are concerned about their trapped V.I.P.s, you’d never know it.And there’s the rub: “Bel Canto” is so dismissive of the outside world — and the background of its guerrilla leader (Tenoch Huerta, making much of the little he’s given) — that it’s politically and ideologically barren. Only one idea interests the director, Paul Weitz (adapting Ann Patchett’s 2001 novel with Anthony Weintraub): the power of music to transcend difference and locate our common humanity. This single, overarching theme welds us to Coss, whose voice (or, rather, Renée Fleming’s) seduces Hosokawa and persuades the authorities to restore water to the mansion. For this, the rebels reward her with a private room and luxury bedding — both of which will come in handy when she and Hosokawa inevitably become intimate.Graciously regal and warmly expressive, Ms. Moore makes a credible diva, but neither the foregrounded love affair nor its lower-class counterpart — a sweet connection between a young rebel (a fine María Mercedes Coroy) and Hosokawa’s translator (Ryo Kase) — has the heft to resonate. The result is a movie that, for all its operatic allusions and actorly expertise, feels dismayingly passionless.At times, in the shifting ground between the hostages and their captors, we can feel Mr. Weitz reaching for something akin to what Bruno Barreto achieved with his 1998 drama “Four Days in September,” a subtle probe of the dynamics of bargaining and coercion, privilege and powerlessness. But “Bel Canto,” handsomely photographed by Tobias Datum, is a movie wavering among identities. Neither romance nor hostage drama nor political thriller, it never builds a head of steam. Unlike a real opera singer, it doesn’t know how to exhale."

This sense of liberation derives from murders enacted with the methodical exhilaration of a jailbreak — a cathartic response to years of oppression by her miserly father, Andrew (Jamey Sheridan), and loathed stepmother, Abby (Fiona Shaw). And when Lizzie strips naked before hacking her two tormentors to slivers, her nudity isn’t simply practical: It’s the repudiation of a 19th-century wardrobe that controlled women’s movements as thoroughly as men did.As played with fierce conviction by Chloë Sevigny (whose longtime fascination with Borden led her to commission the script from her friend, Bryce Kass), Lizzie is headstrong, wily and, possibly, an epileptic. A 32-year-old society spinster in one of Massachusetts’ wealthiest families, she moves resolutely through the gloomy Borden household, every creak and groan contributing to its coffin-like atmosphere. The arrival of Bridget (Kristen Stewart, wary and watchful), a deceptively timid Irish maid, arouses Lizzie’s interest and her father’s, too: twin longings that will help explain Lizzie’s eventual violence and subvert a plot reeking with male power.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018“Lizzie” isn’t perfect — the pacing can flag, and the lovely Kim Dickens, as Lizzie’s older sister, barely registers — but Ms. Sevigny’s intelligence and formidable control keep the melodrama grounded. Her empathy for Borden, whose fragile constitution belies a searing will, is palpable, as is the sense of inescapable peril surrounding the two female leads. When Andrew slides into Bridget’s bed, her terrified face fills the frame; and when Lizzie’s slimy uncle John (a gleefully malevolent Denis O’Hare) reminds her who will control her inheritance, his quietly menacing threats, delivered through clenched teeth, are magnified in extreme close-up.Together, Craig William Macneill’s focused direction and Noah Greenberg’s superb cinematography weave a suffocating cocoon around the two women. Nothing is wasted, and everything has a point: the doomed, flapping pet pigeons whose blood will later be repurposed to mislead investigators; the sudden seizure that grips Lizzie at the opera, with the camera gazing down on her twitching body. Yet while the movie places us firmly in her corner, it refuses to make her an unhinged victim, laying out her coldblooded plans with gory relish.“No one will save you from what is to come,” reads an anonymous note on the Bordens’ doorstep before the murders. It’s intended for Andrew, but could be read as a warning to any one of the characters. “Lizzie” might feel like an escape story, but its killer and her accomplice, locked in a furtive attachment, are still a long way from being free."

It’s less interested in rendering a verdict on the morality of abortion than it is in tracing the increasing politicization of the issue.After all, as Linda Greenhouse, a longtime Supreme Court writer for The New York Times, notes in the film, the court that handed down the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 included four Nixon appointees. (“Abortion was not a partisan issue at that time,” she says. “It was a medical problem. It was a social problem.”)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 6, 2018In 1967, as the governor of California, Ronald Reagan signed a bill allowing abortion under certain circumstances. George H. W. Bush is seen in a clip from 1980 opposing the idea of a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Contrast that with Texas today, where, as the state representative Donna Howard notes in the movie, a candidate’s stance on abortion has become a critical aspect of campaigns for offices overseeing such far-flung areas as finance or agriculture.The movie also interviews physicians like Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician-gynecologist based in St. Louis who travels throughout the Midwest. (She is shown working at the Wichita, Kan., clinic where George Tiller, an abortion provider, practiced until his assassination in 2009.) Two lawyers, Sarah Weddington, of Roe v. Wade, who represented Jane Roe, a plaintiff who sought an abortion in Texas, and Kathryn Kolbert, who challenged obstacles to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, lay out the legal issues.On the other side, Troy Newman of Operation Rescue points to what he calls his “trophy wall” of photographs of abortion clinics he said his organization had shut down. And Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council suggests that Donald J. Trump’s words in the third presidential debate — in which the candidate made the quickly debunked claim that current abortion law allowed doctors to “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day”— helped quell doubts evangelical voters had about him.A film of this scope was obviously in the works well before Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, long seen as a critical swing vote on the issue, announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in June, a development mentioned near the end. The movie concludes, by necessity, without a clear read on what the future holds."

Rick Jr. earns his catchy nickname soon after he starts running with powerful black street gangsters who inexplicably welcome him into their fold, as if he were one of them. (The White Boy name might have been a media fantasy about the character’s putative exoticism, at least that’s what the real Mr. Wershe suggested to The Guardian in 2015. “They did it to glorify or glamorize,” he said, as if he were “an anomaly.”)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 5, 2018The story opens a few years before Rick Jr.’s arrest with the camera fluidly, portentously, racing after a child. The setting is a gun market where the 14-year-old Rick Jr. is getting into it with a dealer over some AK-47’s. Rick Jr. is just a kid, but he knows the difference between a real Kalashnikov and a knockoff, which his father, Rick Sr. (Matthew McConaughey), explains to the startled dealer. By the time father and son are driving home, motoring past miles of abject Detroit streets as Rick Sr. plots their future, a plaintive world — of dreams, broken promises and the two-bit con — has promisingly come into view.A grifter, Rick Sr. sells guns out of the trunk of his car and makes illegal silencers in the basement of the family’s rundown house. His wife is gone, his daughter (Bel Powley) is an addict, and his parents (Bruce Dern and Piper Laurie) are watching his every misstep, an amusingly hectoring Greek chorus. With his wilted mustache and mullet, Rick Sr. looks like he’s already surrendered, but life has not yet snuffed out his can-do American hustle. He’s pushing ever-forward one angle at a time — pinning his hopes on opening a video store — and Mr. McConaughey makes him jumpingly alive, as well as the movie’s most interesting character.In Rick Sr., you see the man he was simultaneously with his ruinous current self, a struggle that speaks to the larger battles outside his door. It’s too bad that “White Boy Rick” only gestures at such depths and instead embraces the familiar guns and criminal poses, limitations that the director, Yann Demange, never transcends. In “‘71,” Mr. Demange’s kinetic, very fine debut feature about a trapped British soldier racing through Northern Ireland, he rarely kept the camera still. Here, his attention seems as restless as his camera but it also feels less certain. He often seems to be trying to stir up interest or clarify the story’s murky point.ImageA scene from “White Boy Rick” with, from left, RJ Cyler, Richie Merritt, YG and Jonathan Majors.CreditScott Garfield/Columbia Pictures/Sony Picture EntertainmentThere is one in this movie, and it’s worthwhile. But it arrives in fragments, mainly in scenes of the law putting the hard squeeze on Rick Jr. and in closing explanatory text about his fate, material that would have served the movie better if it had been dramatized. Working from a script by Andy Weiss, Logan Miller and Noah Miller, Mr. Demange keeps moving as the complications pile up, the law agents circle the block again and Rick Jr. fumbles forward. Mr. Demange can convey mood and feeling with his filmmaking, but he can’t turn Rick Jr. into a viable character and neither can the inexpert Mr. Merritt.Squint and you can sometimes make out the bigger, more complex stories in “White Boy Rick,” including those of a great city violently brought low; of fragile communities left to fail and rot; and of a legal system that seems permanently broken. Too often, though, the movie traffics in genre clichés and the usual suspects, as emissaries of law (mostly white) and disorder (black) swagger and scheme at the opposite ends of the O.K. Corral. Occasionally violence erupts for the old bang bang as some good actors come and go, including Jennifer Jason Leigh as an F.B.I. agent whose scenes suggest the movie that might have been.If the movie were “Black Boy Rick” would it have been made? It’s a fair question given that American big-screen fictions about genuinely sympathetic, fully humanized black criminals are unusual and the only meaningful thing about the title character of this movie is that he was exploited by the law when he was barely old enough to shave. Mr. Wershe’s story is worth telling, and has been told well elsewhere. In this movie, by contrast, the story of his abuse by the criminal justice system — a desperate, commonplace state of affairs — has been turned into a screen fiction primarily, it seems, because of the paleness of his skin."

She returns home to Cannes to run the family stationery shop and keep an eye on her younger sister, Denise. Meanwhile, Max, a volatile mechanic whose pastimes are prizefighting and tomcatting, seduces a wealthy married woman who lives in a suite at the Carlton Hotel. When he crosses paths with the Voise sisters, the aftermath includes rape, robbery, a suicide attempt and homicide. The usual noir business, in shadowy black and white under the Mediterranean sun.“When You Read This Letter,” the 1953 film in which all of this takes place, was directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, which is a major reason it has been restored and rereleased. Another is that Thérèse — a woman whose moral intensity seems to evolve before our eyes into potentially self-destructive passion — is played by Juliette Gréco. Both she and Melville would go on to greater things, and there is undeniable fascination in this early, imperfect commingling of their talents.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnSept. 4, 2018Ms. Gréco, now 91, was on her way to becoming one of the most beloved French singers of the ’50s and ’60s, while Melville, who died in 1973, left behind a canon of tough, electrifying, philosophically tinged thrillers. He came to disdain “When You Read This Letter,” which preceded his breakthrough fourth feature, “Bob le Flambeur,” by a few years and which lacks the narrative density and ethical nuance of later masterpieces like “Le Samourai” and “Le Cercle Rouge.”Still, the earlier film, which never had an American commercial release, has some potent scenes and a gamy, cynical perspective on the zone where middle-class respectability intersects with underworld opportunism. Max is a thoroughly amoral character, predatory and dishonest, and one of the movie’s flaws is that Philippe Lemaire, the actor who plays him (and who was briefly married to Ms. Gréco), can’t quite summon the necessary charm. He is a thug and a rapist, but for the story to work he needs to have enough soul for Thérèse to think he might be worth saving, or even loving.In any case, the moral ambiguities that animate the film’s last act are less intriguing than the world it depicts on the way to an overwrought climax. Melville’s great gift was to emphasize both the radical isolation of individuals and the sticky webs of social obligation in which they nonetheless exist. Amid the hard-boiled banalities and mechanical improbabilities of Jacques Deval’s screenplay, there are moments of jagged comedy and haunting strangeness.And there is, above all, Ms. Gréco’s face, with its sharp angles and geometric enigmas. You might spot a resemblance to Alain Delon, and Thérèse, quietly tormented in spite of her outward stoicism, foreshadows some of the characters Mr. Delon would play in Melville’s major films. Her charisma is indelible and also, within the parameters of the story, a bit superfluous. She makes the movie feel bigger, grander and more alive than it really is — like a premonition of things to come."

The camera follows their glances as they look to see who will betray the stillness. For fans of Sergio Leone, this setup may seem familiar, but the standoff takes place in compellingly undiscovered country, where the rule of genre is as malleable as the rule of the law.These boys are the Five Fingers, a ragtag posse concerned with the protection of their hometown. Instead of Death Valley, their home is Railway, an abandoned shantytown on the outskirts of Marseilles, South Africa. The strongest among this band of youthful rebels is Tau, who kills two white police officers and runs for the hills, leaving the fate of Railway to the rest of the Five Fingers.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018Apartheid ends during the 20 years it takes Tau (a charismatic Vuyo Dabula) to return to Railway, but the promise of a world without subjugation is not realized in his absence. Tau finds that the post-apartheid rebels have become politicians, police and pawns under the thumb of a homegrown opportunist.Though the story serves as a critique of modern South African politics, the white South African director Michael Matthews uses his visual style to emphasize mythology over anthropology. Colors, costumes and cinematography err to the imaginative and allegorical, keeping the commentary crisp. Here, saloon doors are blazoned with crosses, villains wear white shawls instead of black hats and freedom fighters shoot peashooters rather than pistols. In stylish and entertaining fashion, “Five Fingers for Marseilles” looks over the South African countryside and finds fresh vistas for the western genre."
"1359","Blaze","R",1,"A.O. SCOTT","Review: Ethan Hawke’s ‘Blaze’ Revisits a Country-Music Legend","Mr. Hawke stepped behind the camera to tell the story of Blaze Foley, whose brief life was marked by love, whiskey, friendship, music and whiskey.","2018-09-06","2018-08-17","2018-10-06 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/movies/blaze-review-ethan-hawke.html,Read the New York Times Review of Blaze,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/arts/07blazepix/07blazepix-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"“Blaze,” Ethan Hawke’s new movie (he directed, co-wrote the screenplay and appears onscreen a handful of times), whetted an appetite I wasn’t aware I had, though my Apple Music streaming history might have provided a clue. Even if the film were no good at all — and I’m relieved to say that it’s pretty darn good — I would be 100 percent here for a biopic about Blaze Foley, a Texas-based singer-songwriter who died in 1989. (His real name was Michael Fuller.) Furthermore, I would not be sad if “Blaze” kicked off a trend, and I could look forward to sad, smoky, whiskey-saturated movies about the lives and times of Guy Clark, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Robert Earl Keen and of course the great Townes Van Zandt.Anyway, ol’ Townes — I feel entitled to call him that because I saw him play once at Folk City and own several of his albums on vinyl, though I’ve never been to Austin — is an important character in “Blaze.” Episodes from Foley’s life are framed by a radio interview in which Van Zandt and another pal reminisce about their departed buddy, and also (the chronology is a bit baroque) by a gig with Blaze that ol’ Townes never showed up for. Which may be for the best, since he, in the person of Charlie Sexton, just about steals the rest of the movie. Mr. Sexton, with hollow cheeks and graceful hands, is a sly jokester and a bewitching raconteur. He magnetizes attention, sometimes at the expense of Ben Dickey, who plays Foley as a sly, slow-moving bear of a man with a knack for fingerpicking and self-sabotage.Townes Van Zandt in the 1980s would never have won a contest in sobriety or orderly living, but as long as Blaze Foley was around he wouldn’t have to worry about coming in last. As the movie depicts him, Blaze, a witty sentimentalist with a bottomless baritone, was an enthusiast when it came to love, liquor and weed. About fame he was more ambivalent, and part of the delicate drama of “Blaze” involves his attempt to make his mark in the music business without being ground up in the machinery of celebrity.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018Another part — the charming, melancholy core of the film — examines his relationship with Sybil Rosen (Alia Shawkat), an actress and theater artist. (Ms. Rosen’s memoir, “Living in the Woods in a Tree,” is the basis of “Blaze.” She collaborated with Mr. Hawke on the script and plays her own mother in the film.) For a time, they hole up in a rented shack out in the woods, spending their days and nights shivering, smoking, making love and being creative far from the pressures of the marketplace or the scrutiny of the public.There is something exquisitely romantic in this idyll, a portrait of two artists working only for themselves and each other, and of course it doesn’t last. This is country music, which runs on heartbreak and bad decisions. And also, to an extent sometimes unappreciated by non-fans, on humor. There are a bunch of good songs in “Blaze” — the inevitable “Clay Pigeons” and plenty of less famous numbers — and maybe even more good jokes. You can’t always tell, during a jam session or a concert, if the banter is interrupting the music or vice versa. Ms. Shawkat (a producer of the film) is funny and sharp, channeling Sybil’s rebellion against being confined to the role of muse.Mr. Hawke is clearly motivated by nothing but affection for Blaze, Townes, Sybil and the state of Texas. He doesn’t so much scramble biopic conventions as allow himself and the audience to be distracted from them. It’s not hard to see the outlines of a familiar story, even if you’re not familiar with Blaze himself. A tough childhood is alluded to (and visited in the person of Kris Kristofferson, who plays Blaze’s ailing father). The usual sequence of ballad-of-a-tormented-artist verses plays out: early promise; success and betrayal; redemption and death. What pulls against the relentless momentum of biography is the sweet inertia of life, a lot of which is spent drunk, in bed, on the road, hanging out with friends or all of the above.Actors who turn to directing often pay homage to filmmakers in whose movies they’ve appeared. Even if Richard Linklater didn’t appear in a few scenes (alongside Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn), “Blaze” might make you think of him. Like “Boyhood” and the “Before” trilogy, this one takes the time to listen to the odd, random, surprising and incoherent things people say. This is more than idle chatter. Listening to Sibyl practicing monologues, Townes telling shaggy-dog anecdotes or Blaze punning and pontificating is like watching prospectors panning gold. You see splinters and nuggets of art and you leave the theater feeling like you’ve struck it rich."
"1360","Peppermint","R",0,"AISHA HARRIS","Review: ‘Peppermint’ Is Neither Sweet Nor Good","Jennifer Garner teams with the director of “Taken” for a hackneyed, dull vigilante thriller that plays into dangerous stereotypes about Latinos.","2018-09-06","2018-09-07","2018-10-05 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/movies/peppermint-review-jennifer-garner.html,Read the New York Times Review of Peppermint,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/arts/07peppermint1/merlin_143158539_934eba2e-888a-4cb9-bf8a-519a10103c95-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"You have seen “Peppermint” before. Directed by Pierre Morel (“Taken”) and starring Jennifer Garner as Riley North, a hard-working suburban mom turned avenging angel, the vigilante thriller hits all the major tropes of the genre. If Hollywood diversions like “Death Wish” and the bizarro “Face/Off” are your bag, choosing to spend 90-plus minutes watching Ms. Garner return to her early action-hero roots and peel off dozens of evil men with ease might seem like a no-brainer. Yet “Peppermint” is a belabored exercise in lazily constructed déjà vu, without the grit or stylized ham of predecessors it so baldly steals from.During a family outing, Riley’s husband and child are gunned down by members of a Latino cartel led by Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba), and the killers she identifies escape punishment because of a crooked legal system. She runs away before being committed to a mental institution and spends five years globe-trotting incognito, training to become an expert fighter and gunwoman in order to seek revenge.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018As Riley, Ms. Garner growls and scowls her way through her ruthless murder spree, limping like Bruce Willis’s John McClane when injured, but the script’s attempts to forge a resonant emotional connection with her character’s loss ring hollow: After interacting with a young boy on a bus who reminds her of her daughter, for instance, she follows his deadbeat father into a liquor store and threatens him at gunpoint, demanding he be a better father — or else. It is meant to evoke Riley’s transformation into some sort of mama bear-Batman hybrid, but the whole scene is just embarrassing.Riley rarely mumbles more than a couple of hackneyed lines when confronting her targets. TV news talking heads who comment on the action, as well as “Law & Order”-style rundowns by the detectives on her case — Moses Beltran (John Ortiz), Stan Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr.) and Lisa Inman (Annie Ilonzeh) — are employed by the screenwriter Chad St. John to fill in the character-building. But “John Wick” this is not: Even the action scenes lack heft, as Riley is such an expert shooter that hardly any of the adversaries she confronts put up a fight.The paper-thin characterization and clumsy aesthetic choices (frequent, distorted-looking flashbacks) should at least make “Peppermint” a solid contender for so-bad-it’s-goodness; collective audience cackles reverberated through the screening I attended. Unfortunately, the film plays dangerously into violent Latino stereotypes. One blood bath takes place in a piñata warehouse, where Riley mows down Diego’s unsuspecting gang one by one, to the tune of a heavy metal song with Spanish lyrics. All of the dead appear to be Latinos (save for a couple of Korean mob allies), but she leaves the sole white guy working there alive in order to interrogate him. The moment says a lot about the way Hollywood continuously villainizes people of color and values certain lives over others."
"1379","Hal","",0,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: Tracing the Rise and Fall of the Director Hal Ashby","The documentary “Hal” looks at one of the most admired American directors of the 1970s, whose films include “Shampoo” and “Being There.”","2018-09-06","2018-09-07","2018-09-21 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/movies/hal-review-documentary.html,Read the New York Times Review of Hal,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/arts/07hal-1/07hal-1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"When the director Hal Ashby is mentioned now, he’s often squeezed into a cohort called New Hollywood, or as I think of it AltmanBogdanovichCoppolaFriedkinScorsese. This lineup changes depending on who’s telling the story and to what revisionist or orthodox end. Members, almost always men, are added, deleted or downgraded in the footnotes. Warren Beatty plays a role, as does the upstart Steven Spielberg. Ashby — who died at 59 in 1988 and whose films include “Being There” — remains another constant, a mainstay in a group that stormed the old studios in the late 1960s, changing Hollywood forever. (That’s one take, anyway.)The documentary “Hal” fleshes out Ashby’s story, which presumably is not well known to those who believe movie history begins with those 1970s hits “Jaws” and “Star Wars” (or later), or perhaps haven’t dog-eared (and watched) many of the histories on New Hollywood. Yet even if you haven’t read Peter Biskind’s “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” (juicily subtitled “How the Sex-Drugs-and Rock ’n’ Roll Generation Saved Hollywood”), the subject may sound familiar. Whatever the book’s merits, its title serves as handy shorthand for an often-mythologized period, one that has become movieland’s own paradise lost.The director Amy Scott resurrects this Eden in “Hal,” filling it with new (now seasoned) wonders, holy innocents and an abundance of snakes. Using both archival and original material, she fills in Ashby’s past — born in Utah, he was a divorced father by 18 — explores his greatest hits, underscores his singularity and rather too quickly glides over his later-life disappointments. She begins at the inescapable end, revving up with a visibly moved Mr. Beatty emotionally eulogizing Ashby. From there, Ms. Scott jumps deeper into Ashby’s past, checks in with friends and lovers, and then marches forward in time toward his rise and fall.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018It’s a consistently engaging trip. Ms. Scott has assembled a nice, fairly well-rounded group to testify on her subject’s behalf, including people who were part of Ashby’s foundational years in Hollywood — most important, the director Norman Jewison. (The present-day Mr. Beatty is among the regrettably missing.) An engaging, at times emotionally raw presence, Mr. Jewison helps Ms. Scott sketch in Ashby’s early tenure as a studio editor, work that became his entry into directing. The two men met when Mr. Jewison stopped by an editing room in which Ashby was cutting a film. (They bonded, in part, over their love of William Wyler.)The men became good friends, and Mr. Jewison evolved into a mentor figure. They worked together on films that Mr. Jewison directed, including “In the Heat of the Night” (1967), for which Ashby won an Oscar for best editing. They also wrote each other a lot of letters, some very funny. In voice-over, the actor Ben Foster reads Ashby’s, which were often effusively signed with appeals to peace and love. These friends’ obvious affection (“Dearest dearheart Norman,” Ashby began one letter) greatly warms the documentary, along with Mr. Jewison’s sensitive remembrances, helping to turn an already attractive portrait into a vividly alive one.It was Mr. Jewison who encouraged Ashby to direct “The Landlord” (1970), his debut. As Ms. Scott does for much of “Hal,” she lingers on specific films, using clips from them and colleague interviews to fill in Ashby’s increasingly indistinguishable personal and professional lives: Beau Bridges and Louis Gossett Jr. for “The Landlord” and so on. Robert Towne, who wrote (or co-wrote) Ashby’s greatest films — “The Last Detail” and “Shampoo” — drops in, as do Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, who starred in Ashby’s “Coming Home.” Each new film brings new friends, allies and memories, some increasingly sad as Ashby’s drug use escalates.It is very pleasant to gather at the knee of legends like Mr. Towne, listening to once-upon-a-studio-time stories. Even some of Ms. Scott’s more seemingly unlikely interview subjects — Judd Apatow, Lisa Cholodenko, Adam McKay — have something to say. Taken together, they may not always make the strongest case for Ashby’s cinematic genius (the films themselves are greater proof), and there’s also a bit too much vague talk about humanism and individuality. But with Ms. Scott, they remind you that some of his films remain among the finest American works of his era, even if I’m not convinced that I need to see “Harold and Maude” again."

Ms. Kusama cites instances when Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol may have been her imitators. She challenged ideas about the presentation and distribution of art (by trying to sell her creations like hot dogs, for instance). The film also details her experiences grappling with mental illness.Critics haven’t always raved about her art without qualification. But “Kusama — Infinity,” while conventionally structured, provides ample, illuminating access to an artist’s way of thinking and working."

Tourists disembark from a vehicle. In a fixed shot, the camera pivots to show us what they’re there to see: a “witch camp” in modern Zambia. The “witches,” to all appearances, are merely women living in what looks like an outdoor farm prison, attached to ribbons that restrict them to a certain radius.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 28, 2018The movie tells the story of an orphan, Shula (Maggie Mulubwa), who will soon share their fate after she’s accused of witchcraft, as a scapegoat for not very much. Facing questions from a skeptical-looking police officer, Shula refuses to say if she’s a witch. (If you were 8 or 9, would you know for sure?)Shula eventually winds up in the care of Mr. Banda (Henry B.J. Phir), who works for a ministry of tourism and traditional beliefs and recognizes her potential for business. Soon Shula is being asked to use her ostensible powers to point out the thief in a lineup or to assure a white man, who has a vested interest and has paid them, that it will rain. Mr. Banda has a knack for deflection. When he and Shula appear on a talk show and a caller asks why she isn’t in school, he responds, “That’s total misuse of freedom of speech.”The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula’s inability to escape exploitation, but the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality."

Instead of merely miming a French version of the Leiber-Stoller torch song “Those Were the Days,” she begins to sing it aloud, with exuberance, but is shushed by a couple of adults.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018As Lou Reed once observed, some people “can never find a voice/to talk with and that they can even call their own.” In adulthood, played with exemplary concentration by Mylène Mackay, she speaks in a variety of voices — seductive sex object for pay, philosophically minded writer, enraged jealous girlfriend.When the Quebec-based woman achieves literary success after the publication of her first novel, “Putain” (“Whore”), she dismisses inquiries as to its autobiographical content by saying such questions lack “imagination.” Fame and intellectual respect don’t solve her problems with reconciling herself to herself, as she can’t be sure of who she even is. “I need to be seen, but it’s not me I reveal,” she tells her therapist (whom she later tries to seduce).The character Ms. Émond and Ms. Mackay create is not likable, but is puzzling in an engrossing way. I am not sufficiently familiar with Ms. Fortier’s work to weigh in on how accurately this film represents it, but as an act of complex homage, “Nelly” gets to a few interesting places."

Vincent Lindon plays Jacques, a journalist whose best friend and colleague is killed, practically right next to him, in the Middle East. At home nursing a blown-out ear, and PTSD, he is summoned by a Vatican representative. A young woman in rural France, Anna (Galatéa Bellugi) has seen a vision of the Virgin Mary, and is being celebrated by locals — and now, tourists on pilgrimages — as a potential new Bernadette of Lourdes. The church wants an investigation, to which the local priest sheltering Anna has strident objections.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018Mr. Lindon, who carries his powerful masculinity with canny reserve, is superb as a man inquiring into a faith he had previously thought had nothing to do with him. But Ms. Bellugi is a real find; she inhabits her character, who, even as she hides her secrets, is so genuinely beatific that you can hear it in her breathing. Which makes it even more of a shame that the movie, which for two hours is an absorbing, detailed procedural, becomes so willfully diffuse in its final 20 minutes."

The franchise has proved to be a reliable if variably elegant “boo” machine; the same applies here. Specters and hallucinations appear without consistent narrative logic. Characters veer off separately when teamwork might reduce brushes with demons or death.The story’s full connection to the rest of the “Conjuring”-verse is only partly revealed. Is Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), a nun who has not yet taken her vows, related to — or a younger version of — Lorraine Warren, played by Vera Farmiga, Ms. Farmiga’s sister, in “The Conjuring” and “The Conjuring 2”? Also mysterious, at least initially, is why someone so inexperienced would be assigned by the Vatican to undertake a mission alongside Father Burke (Demián Bichir), who describes his work as “miracle hunting,” which means he investigates strange occurrences.The neighborhood of this particular strangeness is a remote abbey in 1952 Romania, where a nun hangs herself in a prologue. Upon arrival, Sister Irene and Father Burke don’t seem duly alarmed about the prospect of spending the night there, or at the fact that the nun’s corpse is sitting upright when they inspect it. (It was left lying down.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018While not as urbane or colorful, the production has the occasional feel of a middle-range, semi-forgotten Hammer Films outing, filled with lore sure to please viewers eager to find out how World War II reopened a gateway sealed since the Dark Ages. There is at least one great set piece: The graves outside the abbey have bells on them — a tradition, we’re told, dating from a time when people feared being buried alive. Sure enough, before the film is over, someone will be ringing a bell.And the director, Corin Hardy, supplies at least two amusing sight gags, only one of which definitely seems like a joke: Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet), the farm boy who guides Sister Irene and Father Burke, sits at a bar for a much-needed drink, still in possession of the cross-shaped gravestone he uprooted after an encounter with the dead nun’s ghost.Elsewhere, there is a door inscribed with the Latin words for “God ends here” — perhaps the Romanian abbey’s equivalent of an “emergency exit” sign. As for “The Nun,” open only if you must."

Tombstone, site of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and a popular tourist destination, is just up the road. Bisbee has a notably violent episode in its past as well, an event that is the subject of “Bisbee ’17,” Robert Greene’s clearsighted and gratifyingly complicated new documentary.Starting on July 12, 1917 — a few months after the United States entered World War I and in the midst of labor agitation across the mining industry — sheriff’s deputies rounded up around 1,200 people thought to be union activists, forced them into boxcars and transported them to the New Mexico desert. What came to be known as the Bisbee Deportation lingered at the margins of local memory, not forgotten but not much discussed either. As the centennial approached, a group of history-minded citizens organized a re-enactment, and Mr. Greene focuses on the preparations for that curious pageant.The nature of performance — the ways reality can be counterfeited and uncovered when people take on different identities — has preoccupied this filmmaker for a while. “Actress” (2014) and “Kate Plays Christine” (2016) both examine individual performers as they slip between selves, taking a sometimes voyeuristic interest in the psychological implications of acting. “Bisbee ’17” is more concerned with the ethical, political and social meanings of artifice, and in how past conflicts resonate in the present.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 27, 2018Bisbee was pretty much a company town until the mines closed in the mid-70s, and some of the re-enactors proudly stick to the company line. While some Bisbeeans see the sheriff as a villain — or as a tool of the copper bosses — others insist that he was responding, perhaps heavy-handedly, to a terrorist threat. Order needed to be maintained, and the militants of the Industrial Workers of the World (better known as Wobblies) were anarchists fomenting sabotage and sedition under the guise of workers’ rights.The arguments that split the town in 1917 divide it still, but within the bounds of civility. The people playing deputies and those playing their victims aren’t really enemies, and their collaboration can be taken as evidence of healing. Recreating a civic tragedy requires a common sense of purpose. But the attitudes that led to the deportation have hardly disappeared. Labor and capital have yet to end their struggle, and the abuse of police power is far from a dead issue. Many of the Bisbee deportees had Spanish or Slavic surnames, and their removal has an element of ethnic cleansing. “Deportation” is as loaded a word now as it was a century ago.Current politics hover over the movie, even though the people in it are reluctant to talk about their beliefs and affiliations. Instead, Mr. Greene’s sympathetic method — you can feel him quietly listening and observing, leaving plenty of silence for his subjects to fill — allows the viewer to discover unstated ironies and resonances. And also, most of all, to appreciate the humanity of both the re-enactors and the long-gone figures they are impersonating.Especially moving is the testimony of Fernando Serrano, a young man who grew up in Mexico and the United States and knew little about the deportation until he signed up for the re-enactment. His political awakening seems to happen before our eyes, as he connects his own life to past events. For others, the connection is more direct. Mel and Steve Ray are brothers who portray their own grandfather and great-uncle, one of whom was arrested by the other.Dressing up in old-fashioned costumes and parading through town looks like fun, and it’s fun to see the modern residents of Bisbee get into character and commit to the spirit of the spectacle. And even though “Bisbee ’17” depicts a wholesome and harmonious community undertaking, it is a profoundly haunted and haunting film. What we are witnessing is not the commemoration of a past disaster but its reanimation. Every important thing this movie is about is still alive."

For another film great, Ingmar Bergman of Sweden, Buñuel’s statement could not apply. There was in particular one title he directed that he consistently saw as a mistake, to the extent that he asked that it never be included in any retrospective or repertory screening of his work.That film was “This Can’t Happen Here,” a semi-allegorical anti-Communist melodrama-thriller that Bergman made for the studio Svensk Film in 1950, when he was financially strapped after a divorce. It is now being made available through the cooperation of his family and Svensk Film, and playing in a restored version at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, Sept. 5-11.Bergman had been making films mostly from his own scripts, or his own adaptations of others’ work, for a good half-decade. Several of these pictures, including  “Prison” (1949) and “To Joy” (1950), are substantial works that some have called masterpieces; they certainly display Bergman’s uncanny, even precocious, command of film language and dramatic fluency.For “This Can’t Happen Here,” Bergman worked from a script by Herbert Grevenius, adapting a popular novel of the day. The story shows Sweden’s infiltration by malevolent agents of a country called Liquidatzia, an allegorical stand-in for the Soviet Union. These individuals, sometimes disguising themselves as refugees, are determined to spread their country’s ideology and its attendant oppressiveness.Like American anti-Communist films of this period, it amusingly paints such characters as true believers in the revolution, who at the same time take pleasure in their applied malevolence. Grevenius’s script, with its clichéd melodramatic flourishes and ham-handed habit of signifying that malevolence via backward spelling (one character’s surname is “Natas,” oy vey), proves intractable to Bergman’s mastery, which looks instead like super-competence with this hackneyed material.The movie stars Signe Hasso, the great Swedish actress returning home after a decade in Hollywood. She plays Vera, a Liquidatzia refugee whose estranged husband shows up in Sweden with confidential documents and an intent to bring them to the U.S. Embassy (this is Natas, who chortles smugly when an Embassy receptionist tells him he’ll be expected “after church”).Bergman worked with real-life Baltic refugees on this movie and felt he was trivializing their actual experience. “This Can’t Happen Here” seemed “almost obscene” by comparison, he told his biographer, Peter Cowie. In cutting off access to the movie in his lifetime, Bergman was not depriving his admirers of a secretly seminal work. What’s finally most striking about “This Can’t Happen Here” is how little it has to do with anything else in the director’s oeuvre. Which doesn’t mean it’s not worth seeing. It is a very striking anomaly."

Watching it for the first time (it’s a movie I intend to see at least once more), I recognized certain antecedents. In some sections the high-contrast black-and-white imagery was reminiscent of E. Elias Merhige’s 1991 film “Begotten.” The 3-D effects are more reminiscent of the underground film maestro Ken Jacobs’s “anaglyph” movies than any mainstream work. And the soundtrack, with its slowed-down human voices and drones that could be ambient except for the churning lower frequencies, has some affinities with the aural designs favored by David Lynch.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 24, 2018CreditCreditGrasshopper FilmThere is a narrative, pivoting on the 1900 hurricane that devastated Galveston, Texas. The movie is bracketed by still photos from the disaster, and moving images of a body of water; screens within screens show footage that seems captured with a malfunctioning time-machine cam: When the images are readable, they seem to be of various environmental catastrophes from a variety of eras; a “picture of what it’ll be like” and what it has been like that can fill the viewer with dread.But “Prototype” presents what story it has so obliquely that it makes Shane Carruth’s challenging 2013 sci-fi film “Upstream Color” look like “The Sands of Iwo Jima” in comparison. The film is relentlessly eye- and ear-filling, sometimes to the point of irritation. It’s a puzzle of strange pleasures, a nerve-racking way of recalibrating how to look at the screen and the world outside the screen. Go if you’re feeling super adventurous."

And not just because this would-be romantic comedy is grating, cheap-looking and a mighty drag: it also turns two seasoned, likable actors into characters you’ll want to throttle long before the credits roll.Frank (Keanu Reeves) and Lindsay (Winona Ryder) are deeply damaged misanthropes who collide at a California wedding. Initial contact is smoothed by a mutual dislike of the groom, who happens to be Frank’s half brother and Lindsay’s former fiancé — the one who jilted her years earlier. The woman can really foster a grudge, and her breath too, as her hostile comments seem to cease only when she exhales, for no discernible reason, on whatever sickly-looking plant is nearby.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 21, 2018Nothing, however, is as ailing as the screenplay (by the director, Victor Levin), which gives Frank the best lines — most of them in the trailer — and a nasty throat-clearing habit that sounds as if a nest of angry rattlesnakes has set up home in his larynx. And because he and Lindsay have the only two speaking roles (aside from a bored mountain lion), the movie plays like one long, snippy couples-therapy session. On planes and at dinner, in bed and during sex, the pair bicker and bitch in uninspired, often static two shots while a banda-style score tootles desperately behind them.Occasionally, subdued extras wander around to remind us there’s a wedding somewhere in the vicinity, but so disconnected are they from our dueling stars that they might as well be in a different movie. They probably wish that they were."

A formalist experiment that soon devolves into a mannerist indulgence, the movie almost incidentally involves a gang of snarly, sweaty men loafing about in a studiously rundown Mediterranean compound. There, amid dilapidated structures and half-buried bodies, a woman, Luce (Elina Lowensohn), strides around in boots and little else, occasionally pausing to emit one of those huge, raucous laughs that’s meant to suggest madness or mystery.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 21, 2018The level of craft in “Let the Corpses Tan” is certainly adequate to the task: The images are sharp, and the colors are deep and often lurid, although also periodically so intentionally dark it can be hard to make out any detail. That’s especially true of the tableaus of a woman, presumably the younger Luce, standing naked in silhouette before various men, her hair fluttering. The men seem to be her audience or worshipers or both. Sometimes she urinates on a man, and the color of her emanations presumably has something to do with the gold stolen by them or by other men. Or maybe it’s a reference to the gold in “Greed” or in “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”It doesn’t really matter who these men are because narrative isn’t of interest to the directors. They are Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani, and what interests them, at least in “Corpses,” is everything but the story. Stuff does happen. Bullets fly, people die. But the directors are most concerned with their own style. They foreground every camera angle and close-up, calling attention to how they’re doing what they’re doing. This can be amusing, as when a dinner shifts from a group scene to a bulging eye face-off, and there’s something undeniably clever about a visual lineup that consists of a looming human skull that blocks a human head that in turn nearly blots out the sun.Ms. Cattet and Mr. Forzani also wrote the screenplay, which was apparently inspired by “Corpses in the Sun,” a 1971 novel by the French writers Jean-Patrick Manchette and Jean-Pierre Bastid. The resulting movie is clearly meant to evoke the kind of Italian popular film called giallo (often thrillers or horror films in an extreme key), except that these directors are so in love with their own image-making that there’s no room for the viewer. Perhaps that’s why while watching “Corpses,” I flashed on Michael Bay, whose style and self-regard can be equally exhausting. But his movies do move. Here, the drip, drip, drip of sweat pours like sand through an endless hourglass."

Not just for what they show of the damage that humankind has done and is doing to its only home, but also for the limited options (if any) that these films present to counter that damage. Last year’s “The Age of Consequences” in particular was real doomsday nightmare fuel.So it’s commendable that someone has tried to make a film about hope, and not pie-in-the-sky hope, either. “Inventing Tomorrow” takes a personal look at some scientists — not of the accredited adult variety but teenagers, international students working on projects to make things better. They are “the people who can fix it, and who are going to fix it,” one of them says at the film’s opening.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 23, 2018A couple of girls in Indonesia are trying to create a filtering system to reduce mining waste.

To explore every moment is to risk overdosing on outrage.“Is This the Documentary That Can Take Down Trump?” asks the headline of a recent article on the film in Vanity Fair.

It’s startling, even inspiring, to see how many humans it takes to condition a fully successful dog. Every single canine on screen deserves plenty of head-pats and naps in the shade.On the other hand, the directors, Dana Nachman and Don Hardy, have drawn heavily on a syntax familiar from reality TV show competitions, and that’s essentially what “Pick of the Litter” is. Watch as five puppies — Patriot! Phil! Poppet! Potomac! Primrose! — compete from birth to be the best of the best. Will they make the grade, or will they be “career-changed” — the trainers’ euphemism for flunking the program?

Dogs who don’t make sufficient progress are transferred to new households, bringing heartbreak to the failed dog parents. More experienced raisers with reputations as fixers are brought in.In short, “Pick of the Litter” makes for unexpectedly suspenseful (and perhaps not entirely reputable) viewing.

Oh, there she is. Playing a stripper. In a strip club where there’s no nudity, because the fabulous Baker boys and their backers felt the need to keep things PG-13. It’s at this juncture that Eli first gets to pull out his weapon. The visual effects are reasonably snazzy.In the hands of more playful creators, this adolescent fantasy could have been fun. (Unfortunately, the 1978 cheesefest “Laserblast,” which has a very similar premise to “Kin,” was a whiff.)

Its sprawling grounds and cavernous rooms evoke ancient aristocratic privilege, but by the late 1940s, when “The Little Stranger” takes place, that grandeur has begun to fade.Dr. Faraday — we never seem to catch his first name — remembers it well. An ambitious provincial physician whose mother worked as a maid during the house’s glory days under the Ayres family, he looks back fondly on a summer day he spent there in 1919, when he was 8 years old and local commoners were invited to a fair. Now he finds himself treating the remaining members of the Ayreses, who are barely hanging onto their fast-decaying ancestral home.Faraday (Domhnall Gleeson) is haunted by Hundreds Hall. The Hall itself also seems to be haunted, though it’s not always clear by what or whom. The best guess seems to be a little girl named Suki Ayres, who died shortly after Faraday’s long-ago visit. Her mother (Charlotte Rampling) still lives there, along with her two surviving, grown-up children: Roderick (Will Poulter), who was badly wounded in World War II, and Caroline (Ruth Wilson), “the cleverest of the lot” (according to a family friend), who drifts toward eccentric spinsterhood. The staff has been winnowed to one, a young woman named Betty (Liv Hill), who figures out that something creepy is going on long before anyone else seems to have a clue.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 21, 2018Directed by Lenny Abrahamson (“Room”) and adapted by Lucinda Coxon from Sarah Waters’s skillfully written Gothic novel, “The Little Stranger” is for much of its running time more interested in the sociological and psychological implications of Faraday’s encounter with the Ayreses and their real estate than with any overtly supernatural doings. Faraday, who serves as a possibly unreliable voice-over narrator, is buttoned up as tight as a waistcoat, only sometimes betraying the ruthless effort that his sang-froid requires. He is always aware of being an interloper — a commoner promoted to “one of us” ironically or in emergencies — and his attempts to fit in make this strangeness more glaring.Mr. Gleeson is adept at this double game. His face is as sharp as a hawk’s but somehow also as soft and unformed as a fledgling sparrow’s. Faraday makes a practice of keeping all feeling in check, presenting himself both as a rational man of science and as the possessor of an exemplary stiff upper lip. As news of the political weather buzzes in the background — the advent of the National Health Service; land sales and tax policies promoted by Clement Attlee’s Labour government — Faraday mourns the waning of old ruling-class prerogatives more plangently than the Ayreses themselves, who would seem to have more to lose. His loyalty to them is more than they deserve or desire.The twisting and cracking of the British class system is always fascinating to observe, and “The Little Stranger” traces the details of its chosen moment of social change with precision and subtlety, and with its own layers of somewhat dubious nostalgia. Since it’s also a horror movie, subtlety can go only go so far, and the past becomes a trunk mined for spooky costumes and effects. There are a few jump scares and shocking images, but Mr. Abrahamson lets the dread build slowly, nudged along by Stephen Rennicks’s mournful, eerie score and Ole Bratt Birkeland’s brown-shadowed cinematography.As Faraday draws closer to the Ayreses, a question starts to percolate. Are they just odd and miserable, or is something more sinister afoot? Poor Roderick, inwardly and outwardly maimed by the war, teeters floridly toward madness and alcoholism, but what about Caroline and her mother? Are they sheltering a sinister secret? And what does the specter of Suki want — if that is indeed what rattles the door frames and carves squiggles in the wainscoting.As is usually the case in movies like this, the answer is not quite as intriguing as the queasy guesswork that precedes its revelation. But the ending is less of a letdown than it might have been, and the final shots are potent and provocative, sending you back over what came before with new ideas and questions. The twist has less to do with who is haunting whom than with spectral methods and motives, and with the fantasies of belonging that dwell within Hundreds Hall’s walls."

His subsequent trial, held in a Jerusalem courtroom and open to the public, was a crucial event in the global reckoning with the Holocaust. It was chronicled by Hannah Arendt in her controversial book “Eichmann in Jerusalem,” which popularized the phrase “banality of evil” in reference to the supposedly gray, bureaucratic personality Eichmann exhibited on the stand.“Operation Finale,” an earnest and effective dramatization of the efforts to find Eichmann in South America and convey him to Israel, instead emphasizes the evil of evil. And also, secondarily and not always comfortably, its charm.This is partly because Eichmann is played by Ben Kingsley, who is capable of suppressing neither his natural charisma nor the impish aspects of it. At one point, while he is in Israeli custody but before he and his captors have left Argentina, Eichmann shares a bit of Nazi humor — a joke at the expense of Hitler, Goebbels and Goring — which elicits a guffaw from one of the Israelis, followed by a spasm of shame. How could anyone find such a monster funny? But of course the people responsible for great evil do not cease to be human, and thus to provoke ordinary human responses, including laughter and empathy.There is nothing banal about that, and “Operation Finale,” directed by Chris Weitz from a script by Matthew Orton, tackles the ethical puzzles and psychological agonies facing the Mossad operatives who must not only hunt down Eichmann but also look after him as the plans for extraction start to go awry. They are all haunted by memories of loved ones killed by the Germans and determined to seek justice rather than simple revenge. That makes their mission an especially agonizing one, especially for Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac), a not always by-the-book Nazi hunter whose swagger masks a deep and restless sensitivity.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 21, 2018Peter flashes back to the death of his sister, Fruma (Rita Pauls), killed along with her children by Nazis during the war. Those recollections, and images of Eichmann supervising the mass slaughter of innocents, serve as cautionary ballast, inoculating the audience against being too caught up in a suspenseful, entertaining wartime thriller. Eichmann’s connections to extreme right-wing elements in the Argentine military and political establishments place the Israelis in extra peril. Their action not only challenges legal and diplomatic norms, but also inflames the wrath of local anti-Semites.Some of them, Peter in particular, also risk a kind of reverse Stockholm syndrome as they try to persuade their prisoner to sign a document formalizing his surrender to them. Tensions arise within the group, which Eichmann is shrewd enough to try to exploit. Not everyone likes Peter, and one of his colleagues, Hanna Elian (Melanie Laurent) is also his former lover.The performances are as solid as the writing and direction. Mr. Isaac and Ms. Laurent have the innate, casual glamour of old-fashioned movie stars. Nick Kroll and Greg Hill are especially fine as fellow agents who serve, in different ways, as foils for Peter. Mr. Weitz’s work is smooth and unshowy, except for a distracting bit of homage to Douglas Sirk’s “Imitation of Life” (and to Mr. Weitz’s mother, Susan Kohner, who appeared in that film).The period atmosphere extends beyond the vintage cars, endless cigarettes and pleated wool trousers. “Operation Finale” resembles a drama from the first golden age of television, back in the ’50s. Its seriousness is more than a little square, and its tackling of weighty moral issues feels more conscientious than truly challenging.It’s a story very worth telling, told pretty well, with self-evident virtues and obvious limitations. Viewers who see it out of a sense of duty will find some pleasure in the bargain. Call it the banality of good."

The would-be thief she discovers at the start of her shift is just the beginning of her epically challenging yet ordinary day in Andrew Bujalski’s stealth charmer “Support the Girls.” There are also rats, a meanspirited boss, a larcenous employee and of course the customers, who guzzle and chow down while ogling the skimpily dressed waitresses or the blaring TVs. Welcome to America!Lisa (Regina Hall) is the hub of this habitually, at times amusingly unsteady spinning wheel. In most movies, characters like her function as backdrop, and so do settings like Double Whammies — a neighborhood version of a place like Hooters. You know what I mean, those generically tawdry spots off the highway in which male characters convene while decoratively underdressed women smile and serve or dance and writhe. Mr. Bujalski, by contrast, likes to foreground people and places that other moviemakers ignore or use as atmosphere. He sees these women, and invites you to see them, too.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Set mainly over the course of one day, the movie follows Lisa, a relentlessly positive soul who’s always moving forward. She’s first heard and seen sniffling in an unreliable car that suggests the tears and obstacles to come. But she soon gets in gear, opening the bar alongside Maci (Haley Lu Richardson), an infectiously cheerful young woman with a blazing smile and an estimably overflowing push-up bra. With another veteran waitress, Danyelle (Shayna McHayle), Maci tends to hover near Lisa, and together they eagerly serve as her seconds in command, sounding boards, cheer squad and surrogate family.Episodic and pleasantly unhurried, the movie follows the ebb and flow of a regular workday while skipping the tedium. Things happen, mostly without fuss. The cops discreetly extract the would-be thief, and the rats remain out of sight; a customer calls a waitress fat, and Lisa shows him the door. She’s trying to clean up another mess — earlier, another waitress purposely plowed into her boyfriend with a car — and it’s evident that Lisa has her own issues. When she briefly meets her sad-sack husband, Cameron (Lawrence Varnado), to look at an apartment, it turns out to be for him alone.“Support the Girls” (the title refers to a carwash fund-raiser for the road-raging waitress) moves nice and easy for so long that it begins to feel drifty, unmoored. It’s not. Mr. Bujalski, who wrote as well as directed, doesn’t lean on shocks and big moments to spark tension or spur the narrative. A fine-grain realist, he creates modest, layered worlds and identifiably true characters, filling them in with details borrowed from life rather than the multiplex: a plastic milk crate used as a planter, the pleather-esque recliners in a stereo showroom, a heart-heavy woman putting heart-shaped stickers on walls.ImageJames Le Gros as Cubby, the boss in socks and sandals, and Ms. Hall. In “Support the Girls,” female friendship is a bulwark against alienated labor.CreditMagnolia PicturesAs the details gather, thickening the story, what seemed like drift is revealed as textured realism. Mr. Bujalski’s touch is so light that it can be easy to miss what he’s doing. He throws just enough at you — seemingly insignificant particulars like the white socks and sandals worn by Lisa’s boss, Cubby, played by a game James Le Gros — that you might underestimate his intentions. But the socks are ridiculous, and so, too, is the bullying man wearing them. Mr. Bujalski may not be waving social-issue flags, but this movie is, among other things, also about female friendship as a bulwark against alienated labor.Race seeps into the story, casually, bluntly, unsurprisingly. It spikes some of Lisa and Cubby’s testiest exchanges and crops up in a few jagged-edged conversations about one of the bar’s unofficial policies. Although it doesn’t register as such, Ms. Hall’s casting itself feels like a statement, even in the insistently well-intentioned, mostly white realm of American indie cinema. Smartly, Mr. Bujalski doesn’t make race into a problem that Lisa needs to solve. Race is just there, as elemental as air and as palpable as Lisa’s resolute pragmatism, which suggests a world of necessary, presumably painful compromises.Ms. Hall, who appears in almost every scene, is the movie’s animating force. In contrast to Ms. Richardson and Ms. McHayle, who deliver delightful, contrapuntal comic performances, Ms. Hall has to play it fairly straight. Lisa whirls through her day (when she pauses, her body sinks and you feel her fatigue), often with a smile that seems on the verge of breaking. You can see a lifetime in that smile. In moments, as it trembles and almost disappears, and as Ms. Hall’s eyes gently widen and her face briefly freezes, you clearly see both the mask and the woman who wears it. You also see what it takes to be a woman in this man’s world — the spirit, grit, pain and, of course, laughter."

She traveled to France, where she had spent an early and apparently unhappy part of her life, and moved in with Juliane Sellam, the 77-year-old widowed mother of a colleague in Quebec. Her intent, as Ms. Bohdanowicz puts it in voice-over in “Maison du Bonheur,” was to film Ms. Sellam in an attempt to understand and possibly capture a “way of life.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018The Paris apartment where Ms. Sellam has lived for 50 years becomes, for Ms. Bohdanowicz, the place of the title, which translates as “Home of Happiness.” Ms. Sellam, cheerful and garrulous, eagerly gives accounts of both her biography and her surroundings. The lovely balcony of her apartment is festooned with geraniums, which, Ms. Sellam notes, repel mosquitoes. She walks the filmmaker through her beauty regimen and discusses how she became a professional astrologer. She’s a profound delight.Ms. Bohdanowicz never appears onscreen in this brief feature, save for a view of the back of her head in the first scene. But her presence — and her efforts to appear absent — are crucial components of the movie. Directing Ms. Sellam during a visit by two of the older woman’s friends, Ms. Bohdanowicz instructs the three to act as if she weren’t there. Asking Ms. Sellam questions, she tells her subject to speak in complete sentences because she doesn’t intend her own questions to be heard in the finished film (although of course they are).The filmmaker sometimes drops in diarylike passages via voice-over, wondering what her footage will yield. Ms. Bohdanowicz’s self-interrogation is clearly important to her art, but I think she worries too much, at least where this subject is concerned. Her hostess, a model of charm, good humor and senior wisdom, is a movie unto herself."

Anyone who has seen a movie about a cabin in the woods knows something very bad is about to happen. But Colin Minihan, the writer and director of this stylish horror film, understands that what really matters in such genre entertainments is not what it is, but how it’s done.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018The first half-hour, when Jules becomes uneasy after learning a secret from Jackie’s past, plays a bit like “Get Out” for gay marriage. Ms. Allen and Ms. Anderson deliver ferocious physical performances, explicating fear and dread in their movements with such precision that this movie would be coherent even without sound. Then it takes a left turn that accelerates the shocks, transforming a mood piece into an action-filled, cat-and-mouse stalker film.In the process, it indulges in preposterous twists and leaden dialogue about nature, nurture and conscience. But true horror fans will forgive its shortcomings since they serve the greater good of gorgeous gore and stunningly staged scenes. Its violence is its least predictable part, with the movie zeroing in on sights you didn’t expect and retreating at exactly the moment you expect it to go in for the close-up. In a film thick with doom and dread, nothing is more alive than the camera."

This template for documentaries, perhaps popularized by the spelling-bee movie “Spellbound,” is getting to be too easy. Not only does it provide nonfiction filmmakers with a clear narrative arc, but it also tips them off about when it’s safe to stop shooting. A contest, won or lost, is over when it’s over.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018A case study in the format’s flaws, Gail Freedman’s “Hot to Trot” delves into the world of competitive same-sex ballroom dancing. In these contests, leaders and followers aren’t fixed. Barbara Zoloth, a dance organizer interviewed in the film, believes that dance will be one of the last bastions of homophobia to fall.Ms. Freedman foregrounds two sets of dancers. When Ernesto Palma’s original partner receives a diagnosis of a brain tumor, he must find a rhythm with Nikolai Shpakov, who is gay but initially resists the idea of dancing with a man. Emily Coles, who has diabetes, speaks of the closeness of her partnership with Kieren Jameson, who is apparently even sensitive to changes in her blood sugar. (And these are couples on the dance floor — not at home.)But while the movie makes a winning case for the passion of its subjects, it bears hints of smoothed-over complexities. When the last title card announces, with no explanation, that “these days, Ernesto competes with a woman,” it’s hard to believe the filmmakers stuck around for the full story."

The case for it has some appeal: Rooting for its principal subject is irresistible, and — while pushing at the edges of what constitutes a documentary — it captures a type of work that movies seldom show.The director, Emmanuel Gras, trails a man named Kabwita Kasongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo as he makes and sells charcoal, with the dream of building a three-bedroom home for his family. The process of charcoal production affords Mr. Gras striking images, from wood chips flying at the lens to smoke billowing from a giant dirt mound.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018With heavy sacks of charcoal loaded onto his bicycle, Mr. Kasongo must walk roughly 30 miles of dirt road to a town to negotiate with buyers. As Mr. Gras watches Mr. Kasongo making the arduous trek — taking breaks from exhaustion, or being engulfed in dust from passing traffic or shaken down for money — it is hard to ignore the presence of the camera (and the potentially helpful human being operating it).The quandaries raised by observational filmmaking are nothing new, and the sticky ethics of ethnographic cinema are at least as old as Robert J. Flaherty (“Nanook of the North”). But to ponder the colonial implications of a French director exoticizing a Congolese man whose family eats rats for meals is to realize that a movie can be heartwarming and heartless at once."

A more conventional filmmaker might have nudged this scathing attack on class entitlement in the romantic-comedy direction that early scenes seem to tease. Instead, Ms. Coixet highlights the undertow of subtle savagery in her genteel material, giving its picturesque setting — an English coastal village in 1959 — a more sinister, cynical cast.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Because of this, the tale of Florence (Emily Mortimer), a young war widow who opens a bookshop in this deceptively peaceful location, becomes more urgent and far more touching than we expect. Almost immediately, old-money forces align against her in the form of Violet (Patricia Clarkson), a grande dame who wants the store’s historic premises for herself. And as Violet — every utterance a scalpel sheathed in velvet — schemes to evict her, Florence finds an unlikely ally in Mr. Brundish (Bill Nighy), a reclusive misanthrope and avid reader.Few actors can convey entire landscapes of emotional pain like Mr. Nighy. In contrast to the parochial power-mongering, his character’s near-silent connection with Florence is an oasis of long, meticulously choreographed moments that are enormously affecting. Their relationship is emblematic of a movie whose greatest pleasures often seem to derive from what fails to happen, the showdowns and declarations that hang tantalizingly in the wind.If the plot prominence of Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” and Nabokov’s “Lolita” suggest a movie more adamant about the transformative power of fiction than this one, “The Bookshop” still grows on you. Wistful but never sentimental, it quietly turns the fortunes of one little store into a comment on the fate of many."

Unfortunately for viewers, this preference for loose comedy over tight action would be more endearing if these rude and retrograde characters made for better company. It may technically qualify as a joke for Eddie to derisively refer to Katherine as a princess; just as it may technically be a joke for the movie to gawk at the gay character who lingers over Eddie’s muscles for a second too long.

Distraught, David combs through the trail of her online presence and passes along findings to Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing), the lead detective on the case. Days go by and the clues don’t turn up Margot, but they are revealing: David learns he does not know as much about her as he once thought. He takes things into his own hands, suspicious of those around him and increasingly unsatisfied with Vick’s investigation.ImageJohn Cho in ""Searching.""CreditSebastian Baron/Screen GemsWhat sets Aneesh Chaganty’s feature debut apart is its meticulously constructed storytelling device, which calls to mind “Unfriended (2014),” the horror film about a group of teenagers whose video chat is interrupted by the presence of an online phantom, and its sequel “Unfriended: Dark Web,” released earlier this summer. Every shot of “Searching” plays out on a screen — a computer, a phone, through the lens of a clandestinely placed camera.It mostly works: It unveils a clever approach to character building, as during the opening montage of family photos, home videos and emails providing intimate details about the Kim family over several years. Occasionally, the effort to commit fully to the conceit feels strained or shows its limitations, as when a grainy camera recording from a distance undercuts the intensity of a particularly dramatic confrontation.Throughout, David’s emotional journey feels wholly tangible — many of Mr. Cho’s scenes involve him interacting with other actors on FaceTime, yet he deeply inhabits his character’s distress and still-unprocessed grief over a different kind of loss chronicled in the film’s first few minutes. While a somewhat silly reveal in the final act feels ripped from a “Law & Order” episode, the combination of clever concept reflecting the prevalence of screens in everyday life, and the pleasure of watching a typically underused Mr. Cho take on a meaty lead role make “Searching” a satisfying psychological thriller."

The background and meaning of that policy is laid out in Mr. Maing’s meticulous and dismaying film, which also illuminates some of the deep, perhaps intractable problems of policing in New York City and beyond.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Not long ago, members of the force were expected to meet monthly quotas for arrests and summonses. Though the practice was outlawed in 2010, Mr. Maing amasses evidence and testimony that it persisted. He focuses on a group of officers — known as the N.Y.P.D. 12 — who said in a lawsuit that they had been pressured to meet illegal quotas and punished when they refused to comply. Supervisors are recorded threatening reprisals against the officers, some of whom are then disciplined for trivial infractions, given undesirable assignments and blocked when they seek promotion.“Crime+Punishment” follows these officers, who are mostly Latino and African-American, as they go public with their case, holding news conferences and sitting for television interviews. One of them, Edwin Raymond, was profiled in a cover story in The New York Times Magazine. The importance of the suit goes beyond the officers’ treatment by the departmental hierarchy. Quotas, to Mr. Raymond and his colleagues, are a symptom and a cause of the dysfunctional, antagonistic relationship between the police and the public, especially young, nonwhite men.The story of the N.Y.P.D. 12 unfolds alongside another case, in which Manuel Gomez, a private investigator with an impressive military and law enforcement background, tries to exonerate Pedro Hernandez, a young man charged with a shooting and held on Rikers Island. With meticulous care over a period of several years, Mr. Maing illuminates how abusive policing, the cash bail system, political paralysis and other factors combine to form a web of injustice that often ensnares the innocent.ImagePedro Hernandez, held on Rikers Island, was helped by a private investigator who sought to have him exonerated.CreditMud Horse Pictures/HuluThe lawsuit and Mr. Hernandez’s case proceed against a backdrop of higher-profile public events like the killing of Eric Garner, the scandals that thinned the upper ranks of the police and the release of the United States Justice Department’s Ferguson Report, which highlighted the way that city in Missouri used fines and penalties as a source of revenue and made its police into armed tax collectors preying mostly on nonwhite citizens. “Crime+Punishment” advances a thorough critique of American law enforcement not by generalizing or speechifying, but by digging into particular lives and circumstances, allowing affected individuals to speak for themselves.The result is a powerful and suspenseful film, part detective story and part courtroom drama, fueled by a potent mix of curiosity and indignation and full of memorable characters speaking in the lively idioms and varied accents of New York. Mr. Maing brings viewers into the daily lives of police officers, some of them veterans with decades of service behind them, who are willing to risk their careers for what they believe is right. They face fear, frustration and agonizing uncertainty as the case proceeds.If “Crime+Punishment” were a scripted feature rather than a documentary, it would have a neater, and perhaps more unequivocally hopeful ending. You can extract a degree of optimism. Sometimes justice prevails. Sometimes politicians and judges listen. But never automatically, through the impersonal workings of the system. This film is about the work, risk and sacrifice — the combination of stubbornness, courage and decency — required to make the ideal of equal justice under the law anything close to a reality."

Blood is spilled, bodies are ravaged. Both movies are sober, high-minded stories about the terrible things that men do to other men in the name of country and righteousness. Mostly, these are chronicles of extreme male suffering, torments so ghastly they turn otherwise ordinary men into quasi-religious martyrs.To what end? The most obvious reason is that the first film is based on a best seller, and the second is, well, based on the first. Each draws from a disputed memoir by Henri Charrière, a French criminal who was sentenced to life for a murder he said he didn’t commit. In 1933, he was shipped to French Guiana, a speck on the Atlantic coast of South America. The French claimed it in the 17th century, using it as a slave port and later a penal colony. Its most notorious section was a former leper settlement called Devil’s Island, which is where the wrongly accused spy Alfred Dreyfus was imprisoned.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Charrière may have been less innocent than Dreyfus; at the least, he seems to have been harshly judged. But much like the original, the remake of “Papillon” isn’t interested in questions of innocence and guilt or jurisprudence. Instead it’s about tough men toughing it out in tough conditions while laughing — or stoically staring or occasionally trembling — in the face of death. The grim reaper has taken up permanent residence here, and is emblematized by a looming guillotine and personified by the guards, the dandified warden and the corpses that are hauled off like sacks of garbage.The original movie is sometimes erroneously called a classic; it isn’t — it’s just old. If it’s remembered fondly now, it’s probably because of its television replays and its nicely paired leads, Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Both were major stars at the time, and the film was a hit. Written by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr., and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, it is overlong and at times silly but has those two magnetic stars, an engaging looseness and flashes of absurdity that temper the interminable barbarism.The remake stars Charlie Hunnam as Henri and Rami Malek as Louis Dega, Henri’s fussy, wealthy sidekick. Mr. Malek isn’t the brilliant technician and ace scene-stealer that Mr. Hoffman is, so there isn’t much for him to do but squint through thick eyeglasses and look aghast at the inhumanity of it all. Because the new movie, like the original, is primarily a buddy picture, Mr. Malek also spends a lot of time looking at the more persuasive Mr. Hunnam. It’s understandable. An appealing performer who holds your attention with both his beauty and low-wattage charisma, Mr. Hunnam offers some much-needed relief from the pervasive grimness.ImageRami Malek plays Henri’s fussy, wealthy sidekick (the Dustin Hoffman role).CreditJose Haro/Bleecker Street MediaMr. Hunnam isn’t yet a movie star, and given current industry trends (big-studio cartoons, superhero flicks, etc.) might never get that chance. His talent is for quiet, unshowy moments, not leading-man grand gestures and important speeches. He has put in a lot of hard work in “Papillon,” most conspicuously in an extended passage during which Henri languishes — and nearly goes mad — in solitary confinement. As the years pass, Henri grows more ragged and haunted looking, and Mr. Hunnam grows alarmingly thin and then thinner, shedding weight in the name of authenticity when good acting should have sufficed.Losing a lot of weight (or packing it on) — Mr. Hunnam shed 40 pounds — is the kind of thing that some actors like to do, but it’s often a needless stunt. “Rami and I aggressively starved ourselves,” Mr. Hunnam is quoted as saying in the movie’s promotional materials. It’s too bad that they didn’t have a better director who instead could have figured out cinematically how to convey Henri’s agonies during his confinement. Working from a script by Aaron Guzikowski, the director Michael Noer generally puts the camera where it should go and adds a sterile Parisian interlude but nothing much else of note.Charrière, who was pardoned, died in 1973, just months before the first “Papillon” opened, immortalizing him. What’s most striking about his story now, at least in its big-screen iterations, is how the abuse reads as a stand-in for the barbarity of colonialism. There’s a suggestion of Catholicism in the spectacle of tormented male flesh, of course. But as Henri and the rest of the predominantly white prisoners are tortured and murdered, it is hard not to see their suffering as a form of white self-aggrandizement and a way of erasing the crimes committed against both the indigenous inhabitants and enslaved Africans."

Maybe both. There is something irresistible and also shameful in the idea that furry figures with googly eyes, hinged jaws and floppy limbs might also possess filthy mouths, dirty minds and the ability to act out all their lustful, violent impulses. That they would be just like us, in other words.Trey Parker and Matt Stone exploited this conceit in the 2004 naughty-puppet action epic “Team America: World Police,” which nearly snagged an NC-17 rating for its hard-core puppet action. “The Happytime Murders,” written by Todd Berger and directed by Brian Henson — a son of Jim Henson, the Muppet patriarch — is less satirically ambitious but more technically impressive.The best moments come during the end-credit blooper reel, where the audience gets a look at just how complicated some of the movie’s simple-seeming gags really were. What you thought was a straightforward piece of cross-species felt-enabled pornography involving an octopus and a cow — or a plush sendup of the most famous scene in “Basic Instinct” — turns out to require all kinds of green-screen effects and intricate camera setups.ImageGoofer (voiced by Drew Massey) in “The Happytime Murders.”CreditJustin Lubin/STX EntertainmentWas it worth it? At certain moments, like the two mentioned, and other, similarly tasteless flights of nastiness, the answer (at least for this graduate of the Oscar the Grouch Academy of Trash Can Aesthetics) is emphatically yes. There are also some less aggressive, quite amusing squibs of absurdity. What would happen if a puppet’s liver were transplanted into a human body — Melissa McCarthy’s in particular? That the question doesn’t even begin to make sense renders the result even funnier. Puppet murder scenes, strewn with fluff and shredded fabric, are also funny.But what holds this patchwork of naughtiness together is some pretty threadbare cloth. “The Happytime Murders” takes place in a noir-drenched Los Angeles where “felties” and “meat sacks” live together in grim disharmony. The puppets are treated as second-class citizens, tolerated for their entertainment value but not fully respected. Just like the toons in “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.”The detective in this story is Phil Phillips (Bill Barretta), the first and last puppet hired by the Los Angeles Police Department, now working as a private detective. He is hired by a femme fatale (Dorien Davies) just as someone starts killing off the cast members of an old television comedy called “Happytime.” One of the stars was Phil’s brother, Larry (Victor Yerrid). The only human actor on the show (played by Elizabeth Banks) was once Phil’s lover.So there’s a sprinkling of “Bojack Horseman” in here, too. But “Happytime” never approaches that show’s melancholy insight into the machinery of celebrity. Nor does it venture into the suggestive racial and class allegory of “Roger Rabbit.” It makes a few gestures in those directions but mostly ambles along through a buddy-cop plot centered on Phil’s fraught relationship with his former L.A.P.D. partner, Detective Connie Edwards (Ms. McCarthy).Ms. McCarthy has proved her comic mettle in all kinds of company, so why not alongside a chain-smoking blue guy in a rumpled suit? She and the other non-inanimate actors — Mainly Ms. Banks, Maya Rudolph and Leslie David Baker — get to do a bit of silly riffing, but it’s mostly tired, bloodless stuff. The plot should be an excuse for comic invention, but it mostly just gets in the way, which makes me think that a feature film isn’t really what Phil and his ilk need or deserve. Like their mainstream Muppet brethren, they might be more at home on smaller screens, in shorter bits. No disrespect."

Self-taught, she went on to write dozens of avant-garde plays (one of them a Pulitzer Prize finalist) that garnered plenty of productions and awards. Her friends included Susan Sontag, who was, for a time, her lover.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Edward Albee, Ellen Stewart and other theater notables reflect on Ms. Fornés’s work, and clips from her plays are shown along with old photographs and film footage. Those are valuable, but none are as rewarding as when the camera returns to Ms. Fornés, whose every utterance sounds poetic yet unpretentious, even as her disease progresses.Michelle Memran, directing her first feature, has long been friends with Ms. Fornés and their affection is evident. Yet the cinematography — credited to Ms. Memran and three others — sometimes distracts with shaky camerawork and awkward angles; potentially interesting facts about the playwright are also left unexplored. This is a free-form glimpse of Ms. Fornés, not a strict account of her accomplishments.Still, “The Rest I Make Up” remains a fine ode to the excitement that Off Off Broadway theater once generated, and a wistful look at an ailing artist as she contemplates her life. (A chance meeting between Ms. Fornés and the playwright John Guare, filmed on the street, is particularly poignant, as is a trip to visit her family in Havana.) Regrettably, the present brings difficulties for Ms. Fornés. But those seem outweighed by so many past joys."

That’s basically perfect. The “realm,” though, in “John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection,” a documentary essay by Julien Faraut, implies approximation, propinquity, “almost.” He was in perfection’s neighborhood; human, fitfully and courtesy of actual fits. Though that record — the highest single-season win percentage in tennis’s so-called Open era (for a man) — remains all his. But statistics-driven godliness isn’t the sort of perfection that fascinates Mr. Faraut.His movie is a dream of Mr. McEnroe, an amusing, hypnotic, whimsical, expertly constructed adventure in craft, built from hours and hours of archival footage of his early 1980s dominance, but only at Roland Garros (which is often called the French Open and which Mr. McEnroe never won). It aims to understand an athlete’s brilliance by turning his game inside out, flipping and reversing it, conjecturing about and psychologizing him, close reading the repetitive motion, quirks, and kinks, breaking down Mr. McEnroe’s breakdowns.The guy’s wildly temperamental tennis would never be my first choice for such an acutely cinematic undertaking. But Mr. Faraut knows what he’s doing. And what he’s done is cull a fantasia — a kind of punk French new wave — from reels of old film. Those belonged to the director Gil de Kermadec, France’s first national technical director of tennis. He wanted to make instructional films, first during Roland Garros, with star players doing prematch demonstrations. Those seemed fake to him. So he got the tournament to let him film the matches themselves, making natural portraits of players, their technique, style and personalities. The last of these was of John McEnroe.The result is as strangely satisfying and oblong a rendering of a sport or athlete as I can think of, up there with Roland Barthes’s essay, from 1957, on the spectacle of professional wrestling, and Kon Ichikawa’s saga of the 1964 Olympics.“In the Realm of Perfection” is slenderer, knottier, more self-consciously besotted than that. It’s both suitable for a minimally furnished den of midcentury modern collectors items and a movie Wes Anderson might have made about Richie Tenenbaum, of “The Royal Tenenbaums,” had life been kinder to Richie. And yet it doesn’t wink. It’s not an antique.Mr. Faraut’s impressionistic conflation of humor, wonder, horror and sympathy whisks this movie to the deluxe suite of the pleasure palace. We’re not given many time stamps, and it’s not until the final minutes that an actual match surfaces (it’s the 1984 seesaw Roland Garros final against Ivan Lendl). The movie is all ideas about time and duration, all rumination about character, persona, drive and mental collapse. .VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 14, 2018Working with the editor Andrei Bogdanov, Mr. Faraut creates montages of Mr. McEnroe’s hopping into a backhand, over and over, of his dam-bursting tirades about the in-ness and out-ness of balls on the clay court. The movie believes enough in him as possibly the greatest ever geometrician of shots to marvel at the angles. It uses the tennis writing of the film critic Serge Daney as one source of insight and the claim that Mr. McEnroe was Tom Hulce’s inspiration to play Mozart as a bratty prodigy in “Amadeus” as another. One of Mr. McEnroe’s on-court meltdowns gets overlain with the dialogue from one of Jake LaMotta’s from “Raging Bull.” Sounds a tad much, I know — Mozart and LaMotta? But wasn’t that Mr. McEnroe at his impossible best: black eyes and symphonies?“In the Realm of Perfection” arrives a week before the United States Open starts. And a not-insignificant aspect of John McEnroe’s relationship to it — and other major tournaments — is now as a glorified spectator. He sits in a booth and comments, for ESPN, NBC and the BBC, on the tennis other people play — calmer, saner, safe from himself."

At a certain point — around middle school, it seems — one of them, Bing Liu, began videotaping their exploits.A pleasure of “Minding the Gap,” his astonishing debut feature, is to observe how skating and filmmaking flow together. As the young men get stronger, bolder and more dexterous, Mr. Liu’s camera skills keep pace, and he captures the sense of risk, freedom and creativity that makes their pastime more than just a hobby.It’s not only the glue that binds them to one another through tough times but also a source of identity and meaning, a way of life and a life saver. “Minding the Gap” is more than a celebration of skateboarding as a sport and a subculture. With infinite sensitivity, Mr. Liu delves into some of the most painful and intimate details of his friends’ lives and his own, and then layers his observations into a rich, devastating essay on race, class and manhood in 21st-century America.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018This movie is worth a metric ton of punditical generalizations about those topics — not to mention the endlessly mulled-over state of the American heartland — partly because it prefers real-life detail to sweeping statements or overheated arguments. But you can’t help but notice that as the three men — Zack Mulligan, Keire Johnson and the filmmaker — get older, their hometown gets rougher, losing jobs and population and inspiring its young adult residents to dream of escaping. You also notice, because Mr. Liu does, that he and his buddies all have experiences with domestic violence.That is a theme that emerges slowly, almost as if taking the filmmaker as well as the audience by surprise. Each story is a little different. Keire remembers a father who could be brutally strict and was especially intolerant of skateboarding, but whose death still feels like a profound loss. Mr. Liu, for his part, recalls a nightmarish household dominated by a sadistic, alcoholic stepfather who terrorized his wife and children. In both of these cases, the legacy of past abuse seeps into the present, undermining Mr. Liu’s relationship with his mother (who is interviewed on camera) and Keire’s self-confidence.With Zack, things are a little different. In the years covered by the film, he and his girlfriend, Nina, become parents, and tensions emerge in their relationship. At a certain point, though, Mr. Liu learns that Zack has hit Nina, and interviews each of them on camera about what happened. His compassion is as remarkable as their candor, and in his capacity as filmmaker and friend he sets an impressive example of how to listen without making excuses.Throughout “Minding the Gap,” his honesty is matched by his loyalty. Those qualities, combined with his deep personal investment in the story, provide a curious kind of comfort. Even as Nina, Zack, Keire and their families grapple with situations that threaten to push them to the edge of despair, the filmmaking process becomes a quiet expression of solidarity, as the film itself is visible evidence of community.I would not call this an optimistic movie. The title can be taken to refer to the chasm between hope and reality, or to the fissures that separate people from one another and from their own best selves. But it also suggests the possibility of self-awareness and the healing power of reflection. Mr. Liu grants his friends and himself the chance to know themselves better, to think out loud about who they are and who they might be. This is, in every way, a gift, and by the end of “Minding the Gap” there is some evidence that it changed the lives of nearly everyone who participated in it. It can have that effect on viewers as well."

Most of that observation is through the eyes of Jonah (Evan Rosado), the film’s occasional narrator and the youngest of three preteen brothers in a mixed-race, blue-collar family in upstate New York. On one level, then, “We the Animals” is a classic coming-of age tale; on another, it’s a near perfect depiction of the emotional damage that can result from economic insecurity.“We’re never gonna escape this,” the boys’ Puerto Rican father, Paps (the marvelous Raúl Castillo, best known for the HBO series “Looking”), exclaims at one point. Ma (Sheila Vand), pale-skinned and beautiful, flinches; she works in a brewery, while Paps is more serially employed in minimum-wage jobs. They met in Brooklyn as teenagers, and now their children run wild, an affectionately rowdy, half-naked pack seemingly unperturbed by their parents’ volatile cycle of flaring arguments and passionate reconciliations.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018But Jonah, about to turn 10 and more sensitive than his siblings (Isaiah Kristian and Josiah Gabriel), is taking it all in. Escaping into a fantasy world of drawings (gently animated by Mark Samsonovich), he struggles to process a deprived, disordered home that can swing from loving to terrifying in minutes. Trauma is never far away, often appearing in the most innocent disguises, like a simple swimming lesson that becomes a petrifying test of manliness. And when Paps suddenly storms out and Ma, black-eyed and broken-lipped, takes to her bed for days, their hungry children go with the flow, turning a convenience-store raid into another adventure.Adapted from the 2011 novel by Justin Torres, Mr. Zagar and Daniel Kitrosser’s script prioritizes mood and moment over a more traditional story structure. At the same time, the cinematographer Zak Mulligan emphasizes the movie’s 90s setting by choosing mostly 16-millimeter film. This gives its rough-rural exteriors and rundown interiors (filmed in and around Utica, N.Y.) a dreamy, nostalgic glaze speckled with lambent light, like the fingerprints of memory. The result is a movie that’s more effective visually than narratively, its threads woven so loosely that at times they almost disappear.What remains constant, though, is a free-floating anxiety that binds the boys (all nonprofessional actors) closer together, moving as if sharing a single skin. Yet beneath that skin, Jonah is slowly pulling away, drawn to a neighbor’s basement where a lounging, towheaded young man silently rewatches mildly pornographic tapes. To the child, neither the images nor the man’s fascination with them are comprehensible, yet his desire to return to that cramped, decaying space is too strong to ignore.Fragile yet resilient, “We the Animals” has an elemental quality that’s hugely endearing, using air and water and the deep, damp earth to fashion a dreamworld where big changes occur in small, sometimes symbolic ways. Cocooned in this limbo, Jonah puzzles over adult behavior and the incipient sexuality that will finally cleave him from his brothers. Their path to manhood suddenly looks nothing like his own."

By the end, it’s clear that their solution to even the most incompetent uses of that violence is more violence. Nine pounds of a cesium isotope known as “fear powder” have gone missing. An informant (Iko Uwais, from “The Raid”) has the password to a disk with the locations but withholds it, pending his extraction from a Southeast Asian city where practically everyone in sight wants to kill him.Got that? Good luck following Mr. Wahlberg’s expository slurry. His character is offensively labeled hyperactive, a condition treated less as a trait than an excuse for the actor to deliver his lines at the movie’s overheated pace. The operation is partly relayed from an ensuing internal affairs investigation, which the protagonist parlays into an opportunity to expound wildly on election hacking, collusion and Donald Rumsfeld’s unknown knowns.The team members include Lauren Cohan as an agent who is threatening to grab a sledgehammer and an ice ax when not texting a cupcake recipe to her daughter. As a martial artist, Mr. Uwais appears quite skillful even when handcuffed to the loosed siding of an operating-room bed, but the cutting is so quick that it’s tough to say. You fear more for the editors’ exhaustion than any onscreen injury."

Cue the jump scares: at Blackwood, the souls of artists past possess the bodies of artists present.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018The director Rodrigo Cortés approaches the supernatural elements of this thriller with surprising elegance, using the film’s sound mix to wring scares from shrouded horrors. But the greatest mystery of “Down a Dark Hall” is who exactly this boarding school gothic is intended to reach. It’s too scary for children, too earnest for teenagers, too tame for horror fans, too lowbrow for cineastes who await the artistic triumphs of a post-Weinstein Uma Thurman. Yet, curiously, this lack of an apparent audience works in the film’s favor. Despite its generic setup, it’s hard to accuse the film of pandering.When Ms. Thurman saunters onscreen, sporting a smirk to match her loopy accent, it’s as much of a shock as the film’s first spectral scares.

(The film is set in 1992, when Joe is said to have bumped Bill Clinton off a magazine cover — a detail that underscores a hint of Bill and Hillary allegory throughout.) The bulk of the action unfolds in Stockholm, where Joan keeps Joe in line while he prepares — with his other laureates, all men — to receive the prize. Waiting in the wings, a writer seeking to be Joe’s official biographer (Christian Slater, cast counterintuitively and successfully) picks at family wounds.Ms. Wolitzer’s metafictional conceit may lose something without Joan’s first-person narration (though perhaps there was a metacinematic correlative — given the focus on how spouses rely on each other, it’s notable the director, Bjorn Runge, is married to his editor, Lena Runge). What the film offers, as flashbacks help to bring tensions between the couple to a boil, is the spectacle of two great actors tearing into meaty material. Mr. Pryce offers a more complex reprise of the Philip Roth archetype he played in “Listen Up Philip,” while Ms. Close sublimely captures her character’s blend of determination and self-effacement."

The writer and director, Ricky D’Ambrose, has called it a “scrapbook movie.” Watching it requires learning how to watch it. Static shots are edited in a deliberately primitive style, eliding crucial bits of narrative. The camera often fixates on ostensible clues: a postcard, books, mysterious home movies in which no one is seen.The perversity begins with the fact that “Notes on an Appearance” primarily concerns a disappearance. David (Bingham Bryant), an American who has been living Milan, Italy, moves into a Brooklyn apartment with his friend Todd (Keith Poulson). (Mr. Bryant, also a sometime publicist and director, is one of several New York City film scene fixtures involved with the movie; my reviewing colleague Glenn Kenny can be glimpsed playing a morgue clerk.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018CreditCreditGrasshopper FilmTodd has been trying to rehabilitate the reputation of the dead political theorist, a firebrand named Stephen Taubes (Stephen F. Cohen). (The fake newspaper clippings about him have a charming verisimilitude.) David begins work as Todd’s research assistant — then promptly vanishes, along with the movie’s most obvious point of identification.As has been the case since the disappearing protagonist became a cinema staple in 1960 (the year of “L’Avventura” and “Psycho”), his absence is at once the point and irrelevant. If Mr. D’Ambrose doesn’t quite earn his pretensions, it’s refreshing to see a filmmaker thinking so far outside the box."

We’re in the midst of essentially creating a new life form on Earth.”Had that quote come at the start of “Do You Trust This Computer?” you might think it hyperbole. Yet it’s said at the end. By then the remark seems an understatement.This part-scary, part-spellbinding documentary, directed by Chris Paine (“Who Killed the Electric Car?”), talks to a gaggle of experts about current artificial intelligence and about what the future appears destined to bring. Their warnings are so dire that you may start peering sideways at your cellphone, wondering what it’s thinking.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018Elon Musk, Ray Kurzweil and others outline the power of big data and existing computer systems, and describe how such technologies have already manipulated world events, particularly recent elections. Worse yet are predictions that robots will displace millions of workers, and that autonomous weapons could wage unsupervised war. Though the film is heavier on summaries than specifics, its messages are troubling nonetheless.To avoid a nonstop scarefest, Mr. Paine throws in a few old movie clips and allows for a bit of optimism. But the interviewees aren’t budging, and the soundtrack sets a consistently menacing tone.Slick cuts and glossy images make “Do You Trust This Computer?” a sleek and engaging watch. Sections on the possibility of artificial consciousness would flabbergast even Philip K. Dick. Still, anxiety runs underneath most of its mind-blowing ideas. We’re told that we may be just a few years away from technologies that are beyond human control. Worry about that if you like, though in the words of one researcher here: “I’m not sure it’s going to help.”"

Jump to present-day Dallas, where we meet Edgar (a droll Thomas Lennon), a comic-store clerk who finds a doll belonging to his dead brother and decides to auction it off at a convention marking the 30th anniversary of Toulon’s most infamous killings — until the ones that are about to happen, presumably.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018Based on stories and characters created by the prolific horror-comedy hyphenate Charles Band, “The Littlest Reich” is certifiably bonkers and cheerfully offensive. Redesigning some of the original puppets and adding others, the directors and cinematographers, Sonny Laguna and Tommy Wiklund, don’t stint on the gore. But the script (by S. Craig Zahler, in nowhere near his “Bone Tomahawk” form), while providing some genuinely funny moments, is so flimsy it feels like it emerged from a spitballing session in a college dorm.As the dolls — now evolved into full-on Nazis — creatively disassemble conventioneers identified solely by lazy signifiers (a yarmulke here, an effeminate gesture there), the filmmakers put their faith in prurience and cunningly miniaturized weaponry. Knives and flamethrowers shoot out from tiny hands, and whirligig helmets slice unwary throats. The little devils are by no means done: their odyssey of bigotry is, as an end note informs us, “to be continued.”"

But she is determined to hold on to her identity as she awaits a reunion with a husband who might not be coming home.That husband (Emmanuel Bourdieu) was a resistance fighter, arrested and sent to a German labor camp as the Nazis were losing the war in slow motion. Marguerite allows herself to be doted on by a French intelligence officer, Pierre Rabier (Benoit Magimel), who’s working for the Germans. Pierre admires Marguerite’s writing, quoting approvingly from her first novel, “Les Impudents,” and teases her with information on her husband’s whereabouts.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018Marguerite’s colleagues in a resistance cell, including one man who’s in love with her, don’t approve of her cat-and-mouse game with Pierre. All the while Marguerite questions her actions and motivations. The director and screenwriter Emmanuel Finkiel dramatizes this through a preponderance of mirror shots and sometimes goes so far as to show one Marguerite watching another in the same frame.Ms. Thierry plays Marguerite with an understatement that can be enigmatic, seductive, or deliberately confounding. The picture as a whole doesn’t do justice to her committed performance. This is a serious, high-minded film, but it’s also a somber one whose quiet spots too often feel not contemplative or fraught, but enervated. The movie is infused with Duras’s words, but doesn’t have her genius."

What it’s not is persuasive.Believing (according to the publicity notes) that the horrific revelations of “The Cove” were achieved by “bullying, pure and simple,” Ms. Sasaki reframes the outrage they triggered as intolerance of cultural differences — the imposition of global standards on local communities. Her ambassador for this viewpoint is Jay Alabaster, an affable American journalist who lived in Japan for almost two decades and is clearly partial to Taiji and its people. As he converses chummily with fishermen and other townspeople, justifications for the hunt emerge: Taijians love cetaceans so much they construct festivals and religious rituals around them; eating their meat is a 400-year-old cultural tradition; the species caught in Taiji are not currently endangered.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018But the main thrust of “The Cove” was animal rights, not endangerment, emphasizing the barbarity of the killing methods, the astonishing intelligence of dolphins and the alleged abuses of the marine-park industry where many of the creatures end up. Largely ignoring these issues (killing methods have improved, we are vaguely informed), “A Whale of a Tale” does admit that the sale of a live dolphin is far more lucrative than that of a dead one, due in part to declining consumption of the meat.Despite the movie’s inclusion of anti-whaling voices (including Sea Shepherd “guardians”), its tone is mostly miffed. The problem, it seems, for Taiji’s social-media-attacked residents, is not their resolute concealment of the hunt, but that conservation groups keep tweeting about it."

Ethan Hawke becomes a grandpa. Is that a spoiler? A shocker? An occasion for tears? For schadenfreude?Let me clarify. I don’t mean simply that the character Mr. Hawke plays — an initially enigmatic, eventually pathetic, finally endearing musician named Tucker Crowe — is the begetter of a begetter. That’s just acting. The thing is that Tucker is one of those invented personages who partakes of the cultural mojo of his portrayer. He released a seminal album in 1993, the year before Mr. Hawke’s appearance in the seminal “Reality Bites.” It is Mr. Hawke’s (quite credible) voice that we hear in Tucker’s old hits and lost demos, and his angular, youthful, beautiful visage that we glimpse in fake-vintage posters and publicity photos. At least on the level of casting, “Juliet, Naked,” directed by Jesse Peretz (“Our Idiot Brother”) and based on Nick Hornby’s novel, seems designed to make some of us feel old.It also made this aging ’90s dude feel a wee bit grumpy. This is not the fault of Mr. Hawke, nor of Chris O’Dowd and Rose Byrne, who play the other sides of a romantic triangle taking shape in the English coastal town of Sandcliff. They are all charming. The film’s reference points, invented and otherwise, are faultlessly deployed. “The Wire” is evoked in an academic setting, with the obligatory Dickens and Shakespeare name-checks wrapped in several layers of eye-rolling self-consciousness. Pop songs are cued in with gentle irony and winsome sincerity. Vintage T-shirts are worn the same way. It me, as the kids say.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018Like “High Fidelity,” still the definitive distillation, on page and screen, of Mr. Hornby’s genial cool-guy sensibility, “Juliet, Naked” hinges on an affectionately critical view of musical obsession. Annie (Ms. Byrne), a curator at a provincial museum formerly run by her father, lives with Duncan (Mr. O’Dowd), a lecturer in cinema and the world’s biggest Tucker Crowe fan. He runs a website devoted to his idol — a bit of a digital throwback to the book’s 2009 setting, though the movie seems to take place in the present — and pays more attention to his fellow online Croweheads than to Annie.The malaise in their 15-year relationship reaches a crisis after Duncan comes by a bootleg CD of acoustic versions of the songs on “Juliet,” Tucker’s legendary breakup album and the last thing he released before dropping out of sight. Annie posts a negative review on Duncan’s site, and then hears from the artist himself. They strike up an email flirtation, which simmers for a while as 25 years’ worth of blank space in Tucker’s life is crosshatched in. He has been collecting exes and producing offspring, growing gray and shaggy and looking after his son Jackson (Azhy Robertson) while living in Jackson’s mother’s garage.Circumstances bring Tucker and Jackson to London and then to Sandcliff. Duncan, who has screwed things up pretty badly with Annie, discovers that his hero is now his rival. Mr. Peretz and the screenwriters (Evgenia Peretz, the director’s sister, is credited along with Tamara Jenkins and Jim Taylor) find an amiable farcical groove, and the actors embrace the ridiculousness of the circumstances without overdoing it. Tucker’s impromptu performance of the Kinks’ “Waterloo Sunset” is a high point of sweetness and absurdity, and Mr. Hawke gets it just right.But the abundant, generally on-target sociological details and comic observations feel overdone and superficial, like an elaborately patterned rug laid over an unfinished floor. Annie’s romantic dilemma may be the center of “Juliet, Naked,” but Annie herself is a thinly conceived character, sketched with gallant protectiveness rather than psychological insight. The men in her life are complicated, difficult, at times impossibly selfish and obtuse, but they are permitted to be interesting in ways that she is not.There is something tiresome and incurious about the film’s romanticism, which rests on the canard that girls aren’t really into music. They like musicians and babies — and having babies with musicians — but don’t share in either the creative passion that motivates Tucker or the ardent devotion that occupies Duncan. The fact that this is presented as a compliment, as evidence of female superiority, doesn’t make it better. The guys are kind of childish, and Annie and most of the other women in the movie are much more sensible and mature, but it’s still the dudes who demand most of the attention, and the women who are expected to derive satisfaction from granting it. I bet someone from my generation could make a great record about that."

The absence of visual pollution makes the location an unusually pure spot to see the heavens — a treasured site for astronomers and stargazers hunting for undiscovered exoplanets, and a place rich in folklore, rock art and mysticism.In a sense, the movie acknowledges its own limitations. One observatory scientist compares humans looking through telescopes to ants unable to comprehend the immensity of their surroundings. Moviegoers may feel the same way. Time lapse compositions of moving stars and clouds pass too quickly to permit reverie. No drone camera that slowly reveals the expanse of a textured landscape could ever quite capture the grandeur of being there.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018And while “Cielo,” hardly unique among experimental films in taking the sky as a subject, describes the feeling of looking upward at a boundless firmament, watching it can’t help but call attention to the artifice of moviemaking. The sides of the frame are all too visible. Moody woodwinds fill the emptiness of the space.Ms. McAlpine’s purple musings in voice-over (“the stars tell me to go on a journey in this desert”), and the decision not to identify subjects formally until the closing credits, give the film an unnecessary fuzziness. Still, the interviews yield scattered moments of poignancy, from a desert resident who believes his dead daughter is watching him from a star to a scientist who ruminates on celestial bodies’ distance and the hundreds or thousands of years that pass before what happens to them is visible on Earth. For “Cielo,” that sense of the infinite is out of reach."

The scale of his fortune is suggested by the first scene, in which his mother, insulted by the manager of a fancy London hotel, buys it out from under him.There’s no doubt in Nick’s mind about whom he wants to marry: Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an economics professor at N.Y.U. originally from Queens. She and Nick, who have been together for a year, are clearly a perfect match. At least in Manhattan. But when they travel back to Singapore for a wedding, Rachel finds herself subjected to the disapproving scrutiny of the older generation and vicious sniping from potential rivals.ImageConstance Wu stars in the romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians,” the director Jon M. Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s best-selling novel.CreditSanja Bucko/Warner Bros.Every romantic comedy depends on obstacles to the central couple’s ultimate happiness. “Crazy Rich Asians,” a busy, fizzy movie winnowed from Kevin Kwan’s sprawling, dishy novel, sets up a series of clashes — between tradition and individualism, between the heart’s desire and familial duty, between insane wealth and prudent upward mobility — that are resolved with more laughter than tears. There are squalls of intrigue and a melodramatic cloudburst or two, but nothing that threatens to spoil the festivities.The venue is fabulous — if there is any part of Singapore that is less than dazzlingly picturesque, we don’t see it here — the music is great, and the food includes homemade dumplings, street-stall delicacies and lavish banquet dishes. But the key to this party is surely the guest list. It has been noted that this is the first Hollywood movie in a long time with a mostly Asian and Asian-American cast, and if anything this observation understates the diversity of the performers onscreen, in terms of both their origins and their pop-cultural affiliations. They include Michelle Yeoh, one of the great international movie stars of the past quarter-century; Ken Jeong, a staple of naughty American comedy for almost as long; and Awkwafina, a hip-hop artist, actress and web celebrity of more recent vintage.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 7, 2018[Why did it take so long to see a cast like this?]That’s only a small sampling. Mr. Kwan’s book, a best-seller that has spawned two sequels since it was published in 2013, runs to more than 500 pages and includes footnotes, genealogical charts and a telephone directory’s worth of names. Its digressions and tangents would easily fill up a television season or two, and the movie, directed by Jon M. Chu, can feel a bit rushed and cramped. There’s too much and also not enough.Still, it’s hard not to have fun, though not always for poor Rachel. After a pleasant excursion with the soon-to-be newlyweds, Nick’s boyhood friend Colin (Chris Pang) and his fiancée, Araminta (Sonoya Mizuno), the family drama and the peripheral silliness kick into high gear. Rachel meets an ex-girlfriend of Nick’s, Amanda (Jing Lusi), who is less of an ally than she seems. More simpatico is Astrid (Gemma Chan), Nick’s ultraglamorous cousin, whose marital troubles provide the most developed secondary plot. Her husband, Michael (Pierre Png), is, like Rachel, an outsider; his insecurity about his wife’s money and status turns their marriage into a potential cautionary tale.ImageFrom left, Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding and Ms. Wu in the film.CreditSanja Bucko/Warner Bros.A more serious intimation of trouble arrives every time Nick’s mother, Eleanor (Ms. Yeoh), looks in Rachel’s direction. (His father is away on a business trip.) Her judgment seems severe and unfair, but she also possesses an undeniable grandeur, a seriousness about family, power and her own identity that is noble as well as cruel. While there is never any real doubt that “Crazy Rich Asians” will come down on the side of free choice and true love, it does pay lip service to the gravity and durability of other values.Mostly, the movie is committed to the value of a good time. It is an unabashed celebration of luxury and money, with hints of class conflict that have more to do with aspiration than envy or anger, set in an Asia miraculously free of history or politics. Comic relief is provided by Peik Lin Goh (Awkwafina), Rachel’s nutty friend, and her nutty parents (Mr. Jeong and Koh Chieng Mun), whose nouveau riche tackiness stands in contrast to the aristocratic hauteur of the Young family. Not everyone in that clan is as regal as Eleanor or as blandly agreeable as her son. There are a gaggle of funny aunties and a witty gay cousin (Nico Santos), who is no less amusing for being a rather tiresome stereotype.You could also view that character as a self-conscious throwback — part of the film’s sly and appealing old-fashionedness. Without betraying any overt nostalgia, “Crazy Rich Asians” casts a fond eye backward as well as Eastward, conjuring a world defined by hierarchies and prescribed roles in a way that evokes classic novels and films. Its keenest romantic impulse has less to do with Nick and Rachel’s rather pedestrian love story than with the allure of endless luxury and dynastic authority. Which I guess is pretty modern after all."

It’s the early 1970s, and Ron (John David Washington), the first African-American officer hired by the Colorado Springs Police Department, has infiltrated the local Klan chapter and chatted on the phone with David Duke (Topher Grace), the organization’s national director.That title sounds more respectable than the traditional grand wizard, and Sergeant Trapp (Ken Garito), who supervises the department’s undercover unit, insists that the smooth-talking, telegenic Duke has his sights set on the political mainstream. Duke and his allies are developing an electoral strategy based on potent, divisive issues like immigration, affirmative action and tax reform that could eventually lead to the White House. Ron laughs. The guys he is tracking are potentially dangerous, but also patently ridiculous. “America would never elect somebody like David Duke president,” he says. The sergeant asks, “Why don’t you wake up?”His plea is something Mr. Lee’s fans have heard before — remember the last scene in “School Daze”? — though rarely from the mouth of a white character. It has less to do with the iffy, easy-to-satirize concept of “wokeness” than with the urgent need to see what is right in front of you. And beyond its stranger-than-fiction, somewhat embellished real-life story — the actual Ron Stallworth actually did infiltrate the Klan, and wrote a book about it — “BlacKkKlansman” is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It’s an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions. (The soaring, seething, luxuriant score is by Terence Blanchard, Mr. Lee’s frequent and indispensable collaborator.)As the movie reminds us — right at the end, when it makes a harrowing transition from re-enactment of the past to raw, present-tense video — we currently have a president whom David Duke likes very much. Rather than add his voice to the chorus trying to explain how we got here, Mr. Lee (who shares screenwriting credit with Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz and Kevin Willmott) muses that we might have been here all along. Which doesn’t mean that nothing has changed, but rather that the racist attitudes and ideas Ron finds among the Klansmen (and around the police department’s station house, too) are durable and tenacious facts of our national life.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018[Read more about Spike Lee and how he approached the creation of “BlacKkKlansman.”]As such, they have always been part of the legacy of American movies too. The first image in “BlacKkKlansman” is a famous, stirring shot from “Gone With the Wind,” of wounded Confederate soldiers around the Atlanta railroad station under a tattered battle flag. The climax involves a screening of “The Birth of a Nation,” the 1915 D.W. Griffith epic that simultaneously spurred the rise of the Second Ku Klux Klan and of cinema as an art form.In a sly and stunning tour de force of film-geek dialectics, Mr. Lee uses one of Griffith’s signature innovations — parallel editing (also known as crosscutting) — to unravel the deep ugliness of Griffith’s hymn to the heroes of white supremacy. As the modern Colorado Klansmen hoot and holler and eat popcorn, reveling in the exploits of their predecessors, a group of black students and activists gather in another part of town to hear the testimony of an old man (Harry Belafonte) who witnessed the lynching of his best friend in Texas around the time “The Birth of a Nation” was playing in theaters. The juxtaposition is chilling and revelatory. The righteous rhetoric of racism is conveyed with the scale and glamour of motion-picture technology, while its grisly truth is communicated by means of still photographs and simple words.That asymmetry is the film’s organizing principle and central insight. Ron’s first undercover assignment is to attend a speech given by Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, who popularized the phrase “black power” in the late 1960s. Duke’s language sometimes echoes Ture’s — Klansmen and black militants both refer to the police as “pigs” — but to see “BlacKkKlansman” as the story of an embattled man in the middle contending with extremists “on both sides” would be to miss the point entirely.It is true that Ron is caught in a tricky position. At the Kwame Ture event, he strikes up a flirtation with Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the Black Student Union at Colorado College. As their relationship progresses (without Patrice finding out what Ron does for a living), they argue tactics and philosophy. Is it better to work inside the system, to push against it from the outside or to smash it to pieces? This is an old, unresolvable debate, a tension that has partly defined Mr. Lee’s own career.[Sign up for Watching and get recommendations on the best TV shows and films to stream and watch.]His fearless embrace of contradiction gives “BlacKkKlansman” its velocity and heft. It is worth pausing to admire its sheer, dazzling craft, the deftness of its tonal shifts — from polemical to playful, from humorous to horrific, from blaxploitation to Classical Hollywood and back again — and the quality of its portraiture. Mr. Washington is witty and charismatic (yes, he’s Denzel’s son), and like Ron he takes the job seriously and enjoys the hell out of it. Detective work, like detective movies, can be a lot of fun. The layers of intrigue and suspense show Mr. Lee’s sometimes underappreciated genre skills. The low-key psychological insight demonstrates his (also underrated) way with actors.ImageLaura Harrier as Patrice and Mr. Washington as Ron Stallworth in the film.CreditDavid Lee/Focus FeaturesWhile Ron reaches out to the Klan over the telephone — “whitening” his voice in the manner of countless stand-up comedians — he can’t very well show up at meetings. That job falls to Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), who starts hanging out with local stalwarts of “the organization.” These include a square-jawed bureaucratic type named Walter (Ryan Eggold), a clever devil named Felix (Jasper Paakkonen) and a drunken doofus named Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser). With the help of another detective, Jimmy Creek (Michael Joseph Buscemi), Flip and Ron keep tabs on a terrorist conspiracy evolving amid all the posturing and slur-slinging.Mr. Lee has often been a gleeful curator of racial invective, and he observes the Klansmen with a fascination that stops only a few degrees short of sympathy. They are monstrous and clownish, but more than just figures of fright or mockery. Understanding what makes them tick is as much Ron’s mission as bringing them down.And though the dramatic crux of the film is Ron’s predicament, his is hardly the only racial identity crisis under scrutiny here. Throughout his career, Mr. Lee has frequently turned his attention to the souls of white folks, to the volatile mix of pride, resentment, defensiveness and denial that motivates characters in (most notably) “Do the Right Thing,” “Summer of Sam” and “25th Hour.” When Flip criticizes Ron for treating their undercover work as a crusade — “for me it’s a job,” he says — Ron brings up Flip’s Jewish background, and the virulent anti-Semitism that accompanies the Klan’s anti-black bigotry. Flip says he never thought much about being Jewish: “I was always just another white kid.”Later, he wonders if that amounted to a kind of passing. “BlacKkKlansman” is about the boundaries of group identity, and how a person can or can’t cross them. On the phone with David Duke, Ron passes for white, but in Patrice’s eyes his presence on the police force is its own kind of trespass. Some of his fellow officers see it the same way, though from the opposite side. But white people, who have more of everything, also have more opportunities for disguise.“Just another white kid” is an all-purpose alibi, and public discourse abounds in code words and dog-whistles that allow bigots to pass as concerned citizens without a racist bone in their bodies. And vice versa. Committed anti-racists can sit quietly or laugh politely when hateful things are said. Epithets uttered in irony can be repeated in earnest. The most shocking thing about Flip’s imposture is how easy it seems, how natural he looks and sounds. This unnerving authenticity is partly testament to Mr. Driver’s ability to tuck one performance inside another, but it also testifies to a stark and discomfiting truth. Maybe not everyone who is white is a racist, but racism is what makes us white. Don’t sleep on this movie."

The experience was, it can be inferred, a defining one for Mr. Schoendoerffer, who died at 83 in 2012. He first wrote “The 317th Platoon” as a novel, and made it into a film in 1964, traveling to Cambodia to shoot at authentic locations.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 6, 2018The cinematographer he brought with him was Raoul Coutard, one of the seminal forces of the Nouvelle Vague, and an ace at capturing striking imagery under tough conditions. The movie’s story is a plain one of war and survival. A French platoon, made up of both French and Laotian soldiers, is ordered to abandon a highland outpost and rejoin larger French forces. The soldiers soon discover that they’re walking right into a growing Viet Minh offensive.The commanding officer, Torrens (Jacques Perrin), is a young lieutenant who’s been in country a little over two weeks. The platoon’s adjutant, Willsdorf (the great Bruno Cremer), is a battle veteran who, as an Alsatian, was forced into the German Army in World War II. The two have conflicting tactical ideas, but enough respect for each other that their differences never come to a head.And they don’t have to. This is a staggeringly engrossing and effective movie, its settings both beautiful and oppressive, its incidents tense and eye-opening. There are no philosophical musings, no what-are-we-fighting-for debates. It’s all about getting out in one piece as the odds of doing so get worse every hour. A terse text at the film’s end is a gruesome, ironic twist on the adage about living to fight another day. Screening officially in New York for the first time, this is a genuinely revelatory war movie."

We don’t learn the specific nature of her injury until later, but it’s alarming enough that her mother tries to forbid her from taking up the board again.And we know what that means. Camille, who lives on Long Island, secretly treks out to Manhattan to check out a skate session for girls, and quickly makes some friends. The group she falls in with is diverse, tough, funny. Their ringleader seems to be the brash, blond Kurt (Nina Moran), but Camille forms a warmer affinity with Janay (Dede Lovelace), whose doting dad will cook lasagna for the crew at a moment’s notice.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018“Skate Kitchen” is not a movie that’s interested in building up a whole lot of narrative momentum. Camille leaves her home, finds a job in the city and seeks romance (at first tentatively, and later with more force) with a guy from a crew of male knuckleheads who like to make trouble for the girls. She then has to deal with blowback from a perceived act of disloyalty. But none of these story elements are given more weight than the characters and their environment, both of which Ms. Moselle’s camera practically luxuriates in.I call “Skate Kitchen” a fictional feature, but it’s more of a doc-narrative hybrid; almost all the members of Camille’s crew are part of a real skating collective that lends the movie its title. Jaden Smith, the cast’s sole celebrity component, plays Camille’s potential love interest, a very low-key skater with ambitions to be a photographer, and to his credit he blends in with the rest of the cast with nary a hiccup.Older New Yorkers often wax nostalgic about places that were important to them and are gone, and grouse that the city doesn’t have the same “magic” that it used to. This movie is a useful reminder that each subsequent generation of New York children gets the city’s magic where they find it. “Skate Kitchen” is a depiction of a particular kind of hangout freedom that’s at its most beautiful when it’s nearly languid, as characters sit on tar-beach rooftops taking in the city at twilight, or navigate street corners on their boards in relaxed arcing motions. Many of its moments perfectly capture the delight and dread of a summer in the city at an age when you may think you’re invincible, in spite of all the everyday defeats life may be handing you.It’s also very frank in showing what these kids today get up to, and while Camille turns 18 in the course of the film’s narrative, she looks younger, and she projects a vulnerability that makes the viewer feel protective, even as she proves to be pretty tough and assertive about her desires.Unlike, say, the alarmist 1995 “Kids,” “Skate Kitchen” doesn’t portray rampaging teenage hormones as a unilaterally malevolent force. Rather, it acknowledges they exist, and that young people are not all of one mind in their responses to them. There’s a boarders’ party, fueled by drink and smoke, that turns into a polysexual near-orgy from which Camille demurs; and one character seems determined to live asexually, at least for the time being. The movie’s disinclination to judge doesn’t deprive it of a point of view. “Skate Kitchen” is unfailingly compassionate to, and genuinely appreciative of, the people it chronicles."

At once a true story and a daring experiment, this deep dive into a maximum-security prison accompanies Billy Moore (Joe Cole), a young English boxer and heroin addict whose fight career in Thailand is abruptly interrupted when he’s arrested on drug possession charges.From this second on, Mr. Sauvaire (adapting Mr. Moore’s 2014 autobiography) uses sight, sound and movement to bind us to the character and share his extreme dislocation. Tossed into one of Thailand’s most notorious prisons, Billy, like the audience, hears almost no English; yelled at by the fearsome guards then dumped into an enormous compound seething with tattooed inmates, he’s silent and terrified. It will be a long time before he speaks, and more than an hour before he smiles.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018CreditCreditA24/DIRECTV Presented with an agitated camera and a bare minimum of subtitles, “A Prayer Before Dawn” adheres to neither the familiar beats of the boxing movie nor the claustrophobic machinations of the typical prison drama. Violence is its grammar and misery its context as Billy faces the unthinkable horrors of a place where savagery rules and the dead lie alongside the living. The clamor and chaos are so pervasive that when he bribes his way onto the prison’s Muay Thai boxing team — and into its marginally safer bunkhouse — the bone-crunching bouts feel like respites from a larger war.Surrounded by a cast largely consisting of former inmates, Mr. Cole is ferociously committed to the punishing physicality of his role. He has almost nothing to play but rage and muscle: the screenwriters, Jonathan Hirschbein and Nick Saltrese, provide him with no past and no future plans. His thoughts are withheld; even his brief encounters with a sympathetic trans woman (an expressive Pornchanok Mabklang) are unrevealing. It’s as if Billy’s life began at the moment we met him.Yet the performance itself is oddly hypnotic, a complete surrender to a movie that, at its core, is mainly concerned with bodies: at rest and in motion, swarming and pummeling, wounded and wasted. In this dreadful place, the meeting of flesh and photography is almost primal, with the cinematographer David Ungaro bringing a brutish beauty and innocence to Billy’s preternaturally pale skin — an unmarked canvas in a gallery of ink and scars. Later, he’ll submit to a prison tattoo artist while a circling camera and Nicolas Becker’s low, droning score lend the scene the gravity of a religious ritual.The definition of an immersive experience, “A Prayer Before Dawn” is a survival story whittled to sweat and sinews. The film’s “Midnight Express”-style abominations aren’t new; what’s different is its director’s impressionistic eye and instinctual connection to his subject’s tribulations. (Mr. Moore, whose life hasn’t been without challenges since his repatriation in 2010, appears in a brief cameo.) Mr. Sauvaire’s approach may not be for everyone, but his skill and audacity are invigorating — and, strangely, liberating."

She shares a bedroom with Jon, a brooding farmhand who furiously scribbles journals mythologizing his affair with Sol’s caustic cousin, Asta. Perhaps to shock Sol, and perhaps as a warning, Asta weaves her own version of the affair, telling tales of a monster that transforms into a swan to lure its prey to dark waters. But Asta’s most bitter narratives are saved for her parents, whom she accuses of living without imagination.The summer on the farm offers Sol her first glimpses of birth, death, sex and betrayal, and “The Swan” is not a film that wants for drama. But despite the upheaval, the director Asa Helga Hjorleifsdottir never displays the passion that her characters suggest in their stories. If her film ever diverged from its ubiquitous images of misty mountains or its plodding piano score, perhaps its characters’ incessant mythmaking would convey deeper mysteries, inner worlds that are not visible to the eye. But storytelling does not belong exclusively to bards and poets. Indeed, in “The Swan,” storytelling belongs to the bored."

To me, the faceless man in a black suit with a thin tie looks like a character out of a Steve Ditko comic. He’s so indefinitely conceived overall that I was reminded of the bit about the druids in the Spinal Tap song “Stonehenge”: “No one knows who they were or what they were doing/But their legacy remains.”The character’s possible amusement value, though, is severely hindered by a recent real-life attempted murder case in which two preteen girls, inspired by Slender Man fiction, stabbed a classmate. That the director Sylvain White and the writer David Birke felt justified in moving ahead with this project anyway says pretty much what you think it does about ambition in Hollywood. (And this isn’t even the first movie inspired by the character!) But as it happens, they’ve wound up concocting the most perfunctory horror picture I’ve seen in some time. It’s not even worth making a “thin gruel” joke about."

Madeline herself, a New York teenager played with bracing conviction by Helena Howard, is not much interested in separating those things. This is partly a sign of adolescent confusion, possibly a symptom of mental instability and very much a matter of creative principle, for both Madeline and Ms. Decker.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018Madeline divides her time — also her loyalty and eventually her resentment — between her mother, Regina (Miranda July), and a charismatic theater director named Evangeline (Molly Parker). One of the youngest members of Evangeline’s company, Madeline participates in workshops and exercises in preparation for what looks like a production of “The Three Little Pigs.” She spends time channeling animal behavior (sometimes as a sea turtle, more often as a cat) and delving into raw, primal emotions. She does some of that at home too.Regina worries about Madeline, which is understandable — she alludes to her daughter’s time “in the psych ward” — and also, to Madeline, infuriating. Evangeline, meanwhile, encourages her protégée to take risks and dig deeper, perhaps to the point of insensitivity to Madeline’s vulnerability. The audience, deeply embedded in the girl’s subjectivity, wavers between impatience with Regina’s uptightness and alarm at Evangeline’s recklessness, all the while trying to locate a stable perspective from which to judge the situation.Which is precisely what Ms. Decker withholds. Her scenes are collages of dissociated sounds and decentered images, and her approach to narrative is oblique and subjective. The result is less a lack of clarity — we can usually figure out what is going on, and how Madeline feels about it — than a suggestive fuzziness, the sense that experiences are also metaphors.Occasionally, the contours of a conventional coming-of-age story are visible through the haze, making Ms. Decker’s techniques seem as willful and contrived as some of Evangeline’s theatrical conceits. Evangeline, fascinated by Madeline’s raw talent and eager to make use of it, risks crossing the line between empathy and exploitation. In her own way, Ms. Decker does too. But if “Madeline’s Madeline” is sometimes unconvincing and frequently unnerving, it is never uninteresting. In its final moments it ascends into heady, almost visionary territory, like a balloon caught in a sudden updraft, and becomes a singular and strange experience."

At first, the writer and director Sebastian Gutierrez’s thriller has the feel of a science fiction-tinged variation on “Rebecca,” with Abbey Lee (“Mad Max: Fury Road”) as Elizabeth, a new bride arriving at the remote and capacious home of her husband, Henry (Ciaran Hinds), a renowned scientist.It’s clear that something is amiss, not only because of their chasmic age difference, but also because of Henry’s domineering, manipulative personality. He lectures her on music and religion, topics that mean little to Elizabeth, who describes herself as “very simple,” and treats her as a mindless repository for his lust.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018CreditCreditIFC FilmsLongtime fixtures on the grounds (played by Carla Gugino and Matthew Beard) regard her as a curiosity, an indulgence for Henry rather than his partner. There is also a room that Henry forbids her from entering. According to Chekhov’s rule of Forbidden Rooms in Houses With Bad Cellphone Reception — and Mr. Gutierrez’s acknowledged, overarching inspiration, Bluebeard — it must be opened by the third act, if not sooner.Mr. Gutierrez keeps the viewer in the same state of confusion as Elizabeth, but each surprise, paradoxically, makes the movie less and less surprising as a whole. And “Elizabeth Harvest” is just stylish enough — from its elaborately patterned lighting and décor to suspense sequences staged in Brian De Palma-esque split screen — to make you wish a more sure-footed stylist had made it."

This very similar ensemble-cast romantic comedy has its characters gathering around their love of dogs, rather than the calendar.But who doesn’t love dogs? One character isn’t crazy to have a canine in his life. That’s Dax (Adam Pally), a feckless musician compelled by his pregnant sister (Jessica St. Clair) to dog-sit her mutt, Charlie, which proves to be a challenge since his apartment building doesn’t allow dogs. Living in the same building is Tara (Vanessa Hudgens), a barista who loves pups by proxy, volunteering at an adoption service. Garrett (Jon Bass), the nerdy owner of that service, adores Tara, but the object of his affection has her eye on a hunky vet (Michael Cassidy).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018You get the idea. Now multiply storylines by about four, add some barks, and sit. Then keep sitting. This is a movie in which a couple find love, and one of them is terrified that “the other shoe will drop.” At this point there’s a whole hour left in the movie. The shoe will drop but will not be fetched.The cast is pleasant and attractive. And the director Ken Marino, whose career breakout was in the comedy troupe the State, drops in some funny absurdist touches, including a droll turn from Tig Notaro as a pet therapist and Phoebe Neidhardt as an oversharing TV weatherperson. But on the whole, this picture, which could just as well be titled “Dog, Actually,” is sweeter-than-average treacle."

Wrapping a political-corruption yarn in a blanket of bullets and blood, the Filipino director and co-writer, Erik Matti, slides visual and textual jokes into the mayhem in ways both sly and blatant. This tongue-in-cheek approach (including a delicious little ditty played over the end credits) doesn’t lessen the impact of his heroine’s journey, but it does significantly ease the tedium of the virtually nonstop slaughter.Casting an even more withering eye on Filipino society than he did in his 2013 thriller, “On the Job,” Mr. Matti locks onto Manigan (an impressive Anne Curtis), a recent transfer to an elite narcotics squad. When a raid on a gang-infested Manila slum goes wildly awry, Manigan and her fellow officers battle to extricate themselves from a constantly replenishing army of crazed opponents and maddened residents. Over the course of one endless, dizzying night, cops and criminals and civilians blur and everyday items are creatively weaponized: that poor soul battered by a cactus then decapitated by garden shears probably just wanted to complain about the noise.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnAug. 1, 2018As the squad is gradually depleted, Manigan’s increasingly solitary struggle becomes one of moral awakening and a vehicle for her director’s sour social commentary. You don’t have to know anything about President Rodrigo Duterte’s controversial war on drugs, though, to appreciate Neil Derrick Bion’s exhilarating cinematography. Zipping through rain-soaked, trash-strewn alleyways, bouncing off walls and leaping skyward as if jet-propelled, his camera dodges every blow and bullet.“This will get ugly,” Manigan tells her companion near the end. Not if Mr. Bion has anything to do with it."

As much eardrum buster as blockbuster, this China-America collaboration — a skull-flattening merger of “Jaws” and “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” — feels so precisely engineered for what the press notes call “global appeal” (read: the enormously lucrative Chinese market) that it fairly drips cynicism.Apparently constructed under the assumption that moviegoers’ I.Q. drops precipitously during the summer months, the movie feeds us bite-sized, subtitle-friendly dialogue, finger-puppet characters and a string of brainless set pieces masquerading as a plot. Filmed in New Zealand and China and based on Steve Alten’s more than 20-year-old novel, the story digs up Jonas (Jason Statham, dependably stubbly), a former deep-sea rescue diver sucking on psychological wounds after a previous encounter with the titular beast.ImageJason Statham in ""The Meg.""CreditWarner Bros. PicturesWhen a submersible belonging to an undersea observation outfit is attacked, Jonas is coaxed off his island retreat and pressed back into service — much to the annoyance of Suyin (Li Bingbing), who doesn’t want him sticking his flippers into her rescue mission. As any hope of romantic tension — or actual acting — evaporates, we’re left to ogle clichéd underwater thrashing about as the so-called Megalodon, basically a crusty Zeppelin with fins, gobbles an appetizer or two.Unlike “Sharknado,” “The Meg” doesn’t seem to know how dumb it is. We’re almost 90 minutes in before authorities are alerted that there’s a prehistoric thingy on the rampage, or that the research mission’s moneybags investor (Rainn Wilson) has just disappeared down its pie-hole.

"1960","The Miseducation of Cameron Post","Not Rated",1,"A.O.

Based on a young-adult novel by Emily Danforth, the film arrives in theaters without a rating, which is probably just as well. The Motion Picture Association of America has a habit of using the R rating to shoo teenagers away from realistic depictions of their own lives, a prohibition that is easy enough to get around in the age of digital streaming but that nonetheless serves as an official endorsement of evasion and repression.The denial of the truth about adolescent sexuality — specifically what some of the characters delicately refer to as “SSA” (for “same-sex attraction”) — happens to be the film’s subject. Cameron, an 11th-grader played by Chloë Grace Moretz, is secretly involved with a girl named Coley (Quinn Shephard). When they get caught together, Cameron is sent away to God’s Promise, a boarding school that promises to “cure” her through therapy and prayer.It’s 1993, but the director, Desiree Akhavan (who wrote the script with Cecilia Frugiuele), doesn’t make this feel like a period drama, notwithstanding the apt grunge-era clothes, hairstyles and musical cues. “Miseducation” is neither a glib sendup of a less enlightened era nor a pious reckoning with the bygone injustices of the past. It is more interested in how its characters feel than in what they might symbolize, and in how they grapple with the conflicting demands of faith and desire. It’s also about the struggle between earnest young people and the equally earnest, painfully misguided adults who are trying to save their souls.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018Of course, Ms. Danforth and Ms. Akhavan (whose previous feature was the post-collegiate coming-of-age comedy “Appropriate Behavior”) are hardly neutral observers. They are on the side of Cameron and her peers, standing with the children against their zealous oppressors. This is as much a matter of genre as of politics. Teenage movies and YA novels don’t generally rally to the defense of adult authority. That would be monstrous.But the people in charge of God’s Promise aren’t quite monsters, and the place is hardly a gothic nightmare. There are bed checks, group discussions and one-on-one sessions with Dr. Lydia Marsh (Jennifer Ehle), the headmistress, and Reverend Rick (John Gallagher Jr.), her sidekick (and brother), who claims to have overcome his own homosexuality. There are also singalongs, field trips and long discussions about sin and salvation. “Nobody is beating us,” Cameron says later. The cruelty of this brand of anti-gay “conversion therapy” is subtler than that, and the agents of that cruelty are less Lydia and Rick than the parents and guardians who have shunted Cameron and the others into their care.Like any good combat movie, prison drama or high school comedy, “The Miseducation of Cameron Post” is about solidarity and treachery among the powerless. Cameron herself is a quiet, skeptical presence, determined to survive by keeping her head down and her feelings protected. Her roommate, Erin, seems to have bought into the God’s Promise program, so Cameron gravitates toward the obvious misfits, Jane (Sasha Lane) and Adam (Forrest Goodluck), who grow marijuana in the woods beyond campus.Even as the plot takes some familiar turns — comical detours and a big tragic swerve — Ms. Akhavan steers away from cliché, and the cast avoids caricature. There is a delicate humanism at work here that feels especially refreshing, a commitment to respecting differences without sacrificing a clear ethical point of view.It’s possible to imagine, and for that matter to wish for, an angrier, more pointed critique of God’s Promise and the religious point of view it represents. But satire and outrage are easier approaches than the tact and empathy Ms. Akhavan deploys. “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” confident in its beliefs and curious about what makes its characters tick, is more interested in listening than in preaching."

Mr. Cohen’s low-budget genre films, running the gamut from killer-baby horror picture “It’s Alive” to tabloid-style political exposé “The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover,” had a “sketchiness and sense of haste,” Wood wrote in his 1984 book “Hollywood: From Vietnam to Reagan.” But, Wood averred, they also had a genuinely subversive conceptual audacity.I’ve more than once seen Mr. Cohen shrug his shoulders in perhaps faux bemusement at praise from highbrows such as Wood (who died in 2009). But, let’s face it: A movie featuring an alien Christ figure outfitted with both male and female genitalia (that’s the quasi-antagonist of Mr. Cohen’s deathless 1976 “God Told Me To”) is bound to attract all manner of interpretation. I suspect Mr. Cohen isn’t sorry to have had Wood as one of his champions.Many more of his champions, including Martin Scorsese, Michael Moriarty, Fred Williamson and Traci Lords, sing Mr. Cohen’s praises in “King Cohen: The Wild World of Filmmaker Larry Cohen.” Directed by Steve Mitchell, it’s as conventional as Mr. Cohen’s movies are not.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018Which is O.K. While the filmmaker himself is more interested in telling colorful anecdotes than dredging up the portions of his psyche that inspire him, the anecdotes are colorful indeed. As when, for instance, he tells of how taking Broderick Crawford and Dan Dailey to a White House lunch with Betty Ford helped him obtain location permissions for his Hoover picture. Mr. Williamson is particularly fun, in part because he enjoys contradicting Mr. Cohen. If you don’t know the man, you should, and this is a lively, informative introduction."

Milla (Severine Jonckeere) and Leo (Luc Chessel) are teenagers in love. In a series of unhurried snapshots, they build a life together in an abandoned house in the north of France, where the only thing harsher than the beaches are their financial prospects. But even at night when the wind blows through their broken windows, the home they make is warm.Beautiful and sparse images float by, observed through the director Valérie Massadian’s distant camera, and they seem to say: Here was the spring we spent when we were so in love. We stole tomatoes, and all the money we had could fit into a single change purse.It’s not clear to whom these passing memories will be addressed until the film’s second half. When Milla becomes pregnant, her life, and the film around her, changes. The camera dares to creep closer, abandoning its two-shot tableaus to focus in on Milla’s face, still round like a child’s, as she reacquaints herself with the world as a mother. She is no longer ensconced in the dream of lover’s time, where every day restarts as if the last never happened. In pregnancy, she waits. In motherhood, her days fly. She works, her son grows.“Milla” is a major achievement, a film that is at once as delicate as it is strong, a fitting testament to motherhood, to survival. With every passing shot, Ms. Massadian suggests that though the business of life is bitter, people, improbably, are still sweet."

According to an article last year in Variety, production there is now yielding around 20 films a year. So the release here of “Cocote,” a Dominican film directed by Nelson Carlo de Los Santos Arias, is a noteworthy event. I wish I were able to give it an enthusiastic endorsement.The film’s protagonist, Alberto (Vicente Santos), works as a landscaper for a wealthy woman in Santo Domingo. The death of his father summons him back to his rural village. There, his sisters inform him that the patriarch was murdered by a hoodlum to whom he owed money. Alberto, an evangelical Christian, balks at the demand that he avenge their father.This is a straightforward story that Mr. de Los Santos Arias, making his fictional feature debut, tells in an ever-changing style, shooting in color and black and white. He also alternates the shape of the frame, mostly toggling between a boxy frame and the wider one most mainstream movies are shown in. Whatever effect was hoped for, this viewer just saw affectation.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018Claustrophobic shots of religious rituals in which the participants scream and convulse yield more in the way of tedium than they do insight into the characters. Yet the film has its moments. The most powerful scene is a single-shot exchange in which Alberto and a local policeman are seen chatting beachside, with beautiful blue water behind them; the policeman recounts a harrowing tale about the corruption that rules everything around them. It’s a superb bit of “less is more” filmmaking. If only this director had stuck to that ethos more often."

A salacious tell-all about the hidden sex lives of postwar movie stars; a peek at the underbelly of the repressive moral dictates of the studio system; a breezy biography of a self-described Hollywood prostitute and procurer; and a psychosexual study of a possibly damaged victim of extreme childhood abuse.Only the last offers a clue to interpreting the movie’s more astonishing revelations and unprobed corners. Until then, Matt Tyrnauer’s gossipy portrait of Scotty Bowers, an impish nonagenarian and former Marine, listens without judgment as he describes decades of servicing the closeted hungers of stars like Rock Hudson and Katharine Hepburn, helped by an eager network of World War II buddies. Back then, in a couple of trailers behind a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, $20 could buy just about anything.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018CreditCreditGreenwich EntertainmentMeandering behind Mr. Bowers as he shares faded photographs of extravagantly endowed young men and prurient factoids about his famous “tricks” — cheekily illustrated with scenes from classic movies that read rather differently in hindsight — Mr. Tyrnauer surreptitiously hoses away the layers of dirt to reveal the fragility of his subject’s anything-goes hedonism. Benevolent hustler (he never took a cut of others’ action) or naughty fabulist — perhaps both — Mr. Bowers putters around his hoarded Hollywood Hills home and gazes into the hole in his patio deck as if searching for something lost long ago.Consequently, what starts out salty ends up as something sadder and more complicated. And when he unabashedly recalls a childhood rife with sexual encounters — which he insists were consensual — with adults, the camera fixes on his mile-wide grin and we wonder if his mission to meet the needs of others has somehow ignored his own."

In certain situations, “gavagai,” uttered upon seeing a rabbit, could mean “rabbit,” or it could mean “dinner,” or something else.None of this is discussed in the new film directed by Rob Tregenza that is nevertheless titled “Gavagai.” It’s that kind of movie. The story concerns a recently widowed German man Carsten (Andreas Lust), traveling solo in Norway, hoping to find inspiration and insight to complete translations of the poems of Tarjei Vesaas into a Chinese language. This had been, we learn, a project of his late wife, who was Chinese.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018Carsten can’t drive, so he hires Niko (Mikkel Gaup), a not particularly motivated freelance tour guide, as a kind of chauffeur. Carsten treats the affable, sloppy Niko — whose shiftlessness annoys his pregnant girlfriend — with consistent condescension. Well, he is preoccupied, and also haunted; an apparition of a woman, dressed in what looks like a Chinese opera costume and makeup, appears to the camera and to Carsten frequently. When Carsten is in a sauna, he is separated from his vision by a sheet of glass.This is a high-minded and carefully composed film about, among other things, the inability of words in any language to satisfactorily communicate states of being. There are pleasures and intellectual provocations to be had here. But its attempted effects fall flat a little too often. With the exception of the sauna scene, for instance, the encounters between Carsten and his late wife feel sentimental rather than otherworldly."

That shouldn’t dismay its target audience, provided the movie’s helium-light tone and unswerving faith in skin, drugs and below-the-belt wisecracks remain strong. And they do.Perched on a spectrum of mental capabilities from harmlessly goofy to dangerously idiotic, the movie’s supporting act of mostly forgettable guys exist solely as foils for its real stars. Those would be Angela (Maia Mitchell) and Jessie (Camila Morrone), teenage besties and waitresses in a small-town Texas diner.

The jokes are dated, the behavior tasteless and the setups tired. Yet the movie has a ramshackle charm that’s due entirely to its vivacious leads, whose mutual devotion and easy, unlabeled sexuality feels endearingly innocent. Mysteriously unencumbered by parents or high school, they’re a team that moves and thinks as one, facing blue-collar anxieties with the insouciance of youth and the safety net of friendship — and the occasional bump of coke.Drawing from memories of her own teenage years, Ms. Frizzell blows a raspberry at age-appropriateness (Jessie is 16), putting lipstick on the piggish behavior of the typically male-dominated smutfest to create something tacky yet weirdly tender. Which makes Michael Bolton and Barry Manilow’s contributions to the soundtrack feel exactly right."

Audrey (Mila Kunis) is turning 30 in the wake of an abrupt breakup — via text — with one of the gunmen, a skinny dude named Drew (Justin Theroux) whose profession was a secret to Audrey. The title of this pleasantly silly, sometimes jarringly violent comedy, directed by Susanna Fogel (who wrote the script with David Iserson), isn’t terribly ambiguous, and I have now explained it fully.ImageKate McKinnon, left, and Mila Kunis find a relaxed, nimble rhythm that keeps “The Spy Who Dumped Me” moving.CreditHopper Stone/LionsgateBut Drew, who shows up back in California to trade a few more bullets and explain himself to Audrey, is as close to beside the point as a heavily armed, lethally trained international operative can be. Espionage is not what this movie is about, and romance isn’t either. Yes, there are chases through various European capitals and another cute secret agent for Audrey to flirt with once Drew is sidelined, but the engine that drives the plot and sparks the jokes is her friendship with Morgan (Kate McKinnon).“The Spy Who Dumped Me” departs from buddy-movie conventions in an important way. Audrey and Morgan aren’t the usual oil-and-water pair of natural antagonists thrown together by circumstance so they can squabble their way to mutual appreciation. Instead, their bond is a constant, an absolute, the one thing in a world of lies and murderous double-crosses that is not subject to doubt. “Don’t trust anyone,” Drew warns Audrey, which is reasonable enough advice. But it’s also implicit that the exception to the rule is Morgan, even though — or just because — Morgan is a complete goofball.Ms. McKinnon is too inventive to make the character a standard, zany rom-com sidekick. There is no real precedent for her highly disciplined comic anarchy, but Ms. McKinnon reminds me a little of Peter Sellers in her command of voice, face and body and her ability to turn every scene into a popcorn popper of verbal and physical surprise.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 26, 2018CreditCreditHopper Stone/SMPSPMorgan, an aspiring actress, says whatever is on her mind and seems immune to embarrassment. She either doesn’t realize how ridiculous she is or doesn’t care. But unlike Sellers’s similarly clueless characters, who were hermetically sealed in their own delusional realities, Morgan is eager for connection. She shares everything with her parents (Jane Curtin and Paul Reiser) and fangirls over the steely head of British intelligence (Gillian Anderson). She is thrilled to acquire a nemesis, a gymnast-turned-assassin named Nadedja (Ivanna Sakhno).At times, Ms. Kunis seems stranded in Zeppo territory while Ms. McKinnon channels the other three Marx Brothers at the same time. But the two of them find a relaxed, nimble rhythm that keeps the movie going through so-so action sequences and less-than-fresh plot twists. Sam Heughan, as a spy who didn’t dump anyone, does the hunky Hemsworth-brother-type thing with reasonable aplomb, and Hasan Minhaj steals a scene or two as his status-conscious partner.The body count is high for this kind of caper, but the mayhem is weightless. This is partly because “The Spy Who Dumped Me” breezes through the clichés of the action genre with cynical weariness, and partly because Audrey and Morgan are having too much fun to be properly terrified. They seem at first like ordinary, innocent people caught up in a deadly geopolitical game, but it turns out that they’re the only ones in the movie who understand what it’s really about. Patriotism is fungible. Love is capricious. Bestiness is all you can really depend on."

Nor does she appreciate being referred to as “Lou Reed’s femme fatale.”“Don’t call me that,” she snaps at an offending radio interviewer in Manchester, England, in 1986. But when you’re best known as a former vocalist for The Velvet Underground and a leading light of Andy Warhol’s Factory — and your very name is an anagram of “icon” — the legend lingers. Equally eager to distance itself from that surreal time, “Nico, 1988” focuses instead on its star’s final years as Päffgen (Trine Dyrholm, fantastic) struggles to manage a heroin addiction, a European tour and a fractured relationship with her suicidal son, Ari (Sandor Funtek).Singularly unsympathetic, Päffgen presents as a longtime neglectful mother, unrepentant junkie and temperamentally unpleasant artist. Cruelly dismissive of her smitten British manager (an excellent John Gordon Sinclair) and abusive to the bandmates she calls “amateur junkies,” she cares nothing about being liked or understood. Bruised and pale and pushing 50, she springs Ari — then in his early 20s and similarly addicted — from a sanitarium and drags him on tour. It’s a colossally selfish act masquerading as love.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 25, 2018Yet Ms. Dyrholm, photographed frequently in brutally unforgiving close-up, fully captures the faded charisma of the woman whose life reads like a Who’s Who of the New York midcentury art scene. In the movie’s most powerful moment, she strides onto the stage of an illegal concert in Communist Prague, strung out and stressed and contemptuous of the danger her fans have faced to be there. When she finally sings, every lyric strums with such anger and regret we almost expect the audience to fall backward, as if from a blast.Gray and gritty and jonesing with nervous energy, “Nico, 1988” sets its ominous tone early as the young Christa and her mother watch Berlin burn at the end of World War II. The sight will haunt her and inspire an obsession with recapturing what she called the sound of defeat.“I’ve been on the top, I’ve been on the bottom,” she says at one point. “Both places are empty.” This hollowness of spirit, the feeling that a boat has somehow been missed, saturates the film; and Ms. Nicchiarelli, using brief archival flickers of Warhol’s Factory parties, deftly connects the carefree chaos of Päffgen’s past to the dark desperation of her present. Dovetailing perfectly, Crystel Fournier’s cool, stark visuals punch up the storm-cloud intensity of Ms. Dyrholm’s voice, a melancholy alto moan that sounds almost apocalyptic. This is music to play at the end of the world. Or at the burning of Berlin."

The movie opens at a formal lunch at Lucien’s family home. His martinet father upbraids every family member present. With determined calm, Lucien gets up from the table, makes a phone call, packs a suitcase, and leaves the apartment, for the last time.As he goes off to pursue his ambitions, we learn about his circle. The phone call is to his girlfriend, Christine (Nicole Courcel, who here brings to mind a young Marilyn Monroe). She is a would-be actress, but one suspects she’s being pushed into a project by her playwright brother, François (Philippe Mareuil). Lucien’s best friend, Roger (Maurice Ronet), trained as a cinematographer, spends most of his time playing trumpet at the jazz bar Caveau des Lorientais (where real-life jazz great Rex Stewart makes a cameo appearance late in the picture).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 25, 2018Roger’s girlfriend, Thérèse (Brigitte Auber), is an actress, and a good, dedicated one; she and Christine both study with the same acting coach. They are soon cast in François’ own play, which is being directed by a wunderkind who takes a romantic interest in Christine, while François covets Thérèse.When Christine is seduced by and subsequently entangled with her director, Lucien doesn’t let their breakup break his stride. He hits up seemingly every foundation, academy or relevant commercial enterprise in Paris to finance his documentary film project, which will involve several months in Africa. Once everything’s in place, we learn that his pals are all meant to be in on the project, and a few of them, cozy in their bohemian homebody states, get cold feet on learning it’s a go. Lucien inspires them with a fiery speech. And he’s also, by this point, invested in getting back what he considers romantically his.Becker was in his early 40s and had several features under his belt when he made this movie, which feels like a personal project for him. His subsequent career would find him moving from genre to genre. But whether it was the period drama, “Casque d’Or” of 1952, the 1954 aging-gangster picture “Touchez Pas au Grisbi,” or the prison-break movie “Le Trou” (Becker’s last work; tragically, he died in 1960, the year of its release, at age 53), his pictures always felt authoritative to the point of being definitive.So too does “Rendezvous,” which is superabundant in charm, wit and soul, and has many expressive visual touches. Especially in a climactic dinner-party scene that is set in an ideal bohemian quasi loft, replete with dark corners where the film’s romantic couples can square off or make out."

He checks the 8-year-old boy who was riding for a concussion, sits with him for a bit and urges the family to take him to a medical clinic. The father, Moosa (Navid Mohammadzadeh), initially refuses compensation but relents.Then the boy turns up dead in Dr. Nariman’s hospital. Sayeh (Hediyeh Tehrani), the colleague who performs the autopsy, rules the cause of death to be botulism — something that a test confirms the boy had. What are the odds?It soon becomes clear that the movie is a dual character study exploring the lives of Dr. Nariman and Moosa, each with a limited sense of what the other knows, and each seething with guilt. Was botulism the immediate cause of death? Would the boy have died within days anyway, even without the accident? Should the parents know what Dr. Nariman fears, particularly as it bears on their subsequent actions?A tad overdetermined in its studied, snowballing ambiguities, “No Date, No Signature” is dramatized with an acute sense of the role of class in Iranian society, and is unfussily well directed, creating visual parallels between the two men."
"2100","Prairie Trilogy","",1,"GLENN KENNY","Review: In ‘Prairie Trilogy,’ All-American Stories of Socialism","Three films made between 1977 and 1980 recount the efforts of a labor union in North Dakota shortly before World War I.","2018-07-26",NA,NA,article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/movies/prairie-trilogy-review-socialism.html,Read the New York Times Review of Prairie Trilogy,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/arts/27prairietrilogy/27prairietrilogy-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"What does it mean to be a socialist in America, and why do people get so angry, and angrily terrified, when some Americans espouse socialism as a fairer system than the one in place? These questions have been coming up more frequently in recent years, prompted by the rhetoric and policy propositions of the recent presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders and the ascendance of younger politicians, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congressional candidate from New York who is unabashedly aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America.You may find an engaging answer to at least the first of the above questions in “Prairie Trilogy,” a collection of three short documentaries made between 1977 and 1980 and directed by the regional filmmakers John Hanson and Rob Nilsson. Now playing in New York in restored form, the movies are companion pieces to Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nilsson’s 1978 feature “Northern Lights,” a fictionalized tale of the real North Dakota labor union called the Nonpartisan League, which formed about a half a decade before America’s involvement in World War I.The first of the three films is “Prairie Fire,” which uses historical photos and archival footage (shot by Frithjof Holmboe, Mr. Nilsson’s grandfather) to tell the story of a simple struggle in 1916 between the grain farmers of North Dakota and the money men who exploited them.The narrator is Henry Martinson, 97 at the time this movie was assembled, who speaks of the “Eastern grain markets, railroads and banks” that the Nonpartisan League mobilized against. Martinson was an organizer for the League; before that, he had edited a socialist newspaper called The Iconoclast.The organization had some success in wresting the “mean of production,” as they say, from the moneyed interests who kept at a far remove from the working man. (These money men practiced “hotel politics,” arriving in towns by rail, barricading themselves in deluxe hotels and fixing the local legislatures from there.) Once World War I conscription began, the entrenched media of the day was successfully able to paint the League as anti-American, and it began to fray.Martinson, who was also a poet, narrates with fervor but also detachment; he’s recounting, not propagandizing. His plain-spokenness about the League’s goals suggests that this socialist’s aim is not some Orwellian nightmare of conformity but a world in which workers are also owners and get what’s coming to them. As opposed, say, to farmers being lent money to buy equipment at such exorbitant rates that they could never pay it back.The directors use a lot of techniques that would become famous through the work of Ken Burns (whose career was beginning at the time these films were made), such as moving the camera slowly in to a still picture and cutting on movement, to create a feeling of flow within their montages.The other two films, “Rebel Earth” and “Survivor” (both, like “Prairie Fire,” shot in grainy, immediate-feeling black and white) catch up with Martinson in the then present-day world of the late 1970s. In the company of a younger farmer, Jon Ness, Martinson goes to bars, pool halls and other locales, surveying the situation with grain farmers and in some cases getting into lively arguments. He addresses the North Dakota State Legislature, or at least its empty hall, to the delight of Mr. Ness and his buddies, wryly recollecting the elections he lost.In “Survivor,” Martinson (who died in 1981 at 98) communes with some of his still-living contemporaries. These are affectionate and affecting portraits. This socialist was a learned man, a little bit of a romantic, but someone nevertheless devoted to practical solutions to very real problems. These films — which were funded, in part, by the North Dakota A.F.L.-C.I.O. — are moving and still pertinent depictions of the human realities that animate labor struggles."

Swerving from predictable to confounding, dreamy to demented, artful to awkward, this genre-twisting hybrid from Juliana Rojas and Marco Dutra links art house and slaughterhouse with unexpected success. When you drop a werewolf child into a lesbian love affair, you don’t need musical numbers to grasp that you’re watching something unique.Set in a mostly nocturnal São Paulo, the story sends Clara (a riveting Isabél Zuaa), an African-Brazilian nurse, to be a nanny for a wealthy single mother to be, Ana (Marjorie Estiano). Spoiled and estranged from her plantation-owning family, Ana initially treats Clara as a personal maid. But as her delivery approaches and her behaviors become more disturbing — among them, sleepwalking and feline hunting — the women grow closer and more mutually reliant. When the child-monster arrives, it will tear mother, and movie, apart.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018Ambitiously allegorical, “Good Manners” dramatizes class and racial tensions in contemporary Brazil by creating contrasting worlds: rich and poor, black and white, high-rise chic and shantytown. Suffused with harp music and gorgeously lighted (the cinematographer, Rui Poças, paints inky shadows you could drown in), the film blends raw horror, deftly composed songs, beautifully drawn storyboards and strong lead performances into a single, elegant package.Leaping forward almost 10 years, the second half shifts gears as Clara struggles to help her intermittently hairy charge (played by the charming, and aptly named, Miguel Lobo) pass in public. The little beast is slowly learning who he is; but, clearly, his directors — who previously collaborated on the drama “Hard Labor” — already have their identities down pat."

In using this juxtaposition as a metaphor for growing inequality and the shrinking middle class, the filmmakers are helped considerably by the coach, Carl Johnson, who is both a charismatic character and a sharp observer of his town; his assistant Joe Zucker, whose day job is as a celebrated artist (this might explain why the art dealer Larry Gagosian is another producer of the film); and a clueless, Maserati-driving real estate agent, the perfect stand-in for the forces of gentrification.While the players are the central subjects, the movie doesn’t dig as deeply into their lives as “Hoops Dreams” does with its subjects. Instead, “Killer Bees” often cuts to footage of games from previous decades or interviews with stars from earlier eras. The movie is ultimately less about the players or even the engrossingly shot games than the idea of basketball as a tradition, one that imbues lives with meaning and bonds a community. This is under threat from the changing composition of the town, and what makes this story compelling is that the outcome of that contest remains uncertain."

It centers on a young man much like him, Emanuel (Lucian Teodor Rus), who receives that diagnosis when he arrives at a sanitarium by the sea as the film opens in 1937.Emanuel remains there for the majority of the film, encased in a body cast to prevent his spine from breaking, facing an uncertain prognosis and incongruously upbeat banter from the medical staff. In his confinement, he consorts with a revolving cast of the lost and the damaged, including a former patient named Solange (Ivana Mladenovic), who becomes the object of his affection at a time and place where fidelity tends to waver.Emanuel’s erotic fumblings, with and apart from Solange, are just one aspect of his absurdist ordeal — absurd both because of his loss of control (on a visit, his mother cluelessly frets that he can’t keep kosher in the hospital) and because the road to World War II is being paved outside. (The premises aren’t immune to anti-Semitism, either.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018“We are denied even the heroism of true tuberculosis,” Emanuel says to a patient with the same disease. “Lung tuberculosis — that would have been romantic.”Mr. Jude wastes no time establishing that this won’t be an easy film to watch. Early on, he keeps the camera perfectly still while Emanuel, screaming, has a giant needle full of pus drained from an abscess. Nothing that follows is so graphic, but the film remains demanding and at times obscure.Liberally sprinkled with title cards featuring passages from Mr. Blecher’s writing, the movie is otherwise perversely antiliterary; it’s the rare page-to-screen adaptation in which the camera becomes an essential character. The action often unfolds in long shot, with crowded compositions in which the principals are obscured by door frames. Over time, the withholding of conventional editing patterns and the sensitization to subtle changes in camera placement become an analogue for Emanuel’s entrapment. For us as for him, the world is nothing more or less than the golden glow of the hospital lights, the ugly teal of its walls, a chair, a mirror or a bedside table covered with books.Aesthetically, “Scarred Hearts” is in many ways the mirror image of Mr. Jude’s previous film, the wide-screen, black-and-white Romanian western “Aferim!”This film is in color, shot in the claustrophobic Academy ratio of the period (with rounded edges added, as if audience members were looking through an old viewfinder) and resolutely antigenre. Those eager to take the plunge are advised to go on the opening night, Friday, when Anthology Film Archives will screen a 35-millimeter print while a speaker of Romanian projects English subtitles in real time. What better way is there to experience the tangibility of Emanuel’s world?"

More accurately, it compels our attention with a remorseless, gripping single-mindedness, presenting Naziism as a communicable disease that smothers conscience, paralyzes resistance and extinguishes all shreds of humanity.Based on the astonishing true story of Pvt. Willi Herold (Max Hubacher), a teenage deserter from the German army whose sadism would eventually earn him the nickname of the Executioner of Emsland, the movie picks up two weeks before the end of the war. Germany is in chaos and the petrified Herold, fleeing military police, finds a Nazi captain’s uniform and can’t believe his luck when it fits. Thus disguised, he soon organizes a car, weapons and a ragtag band of brothers whose unquestioning acceptance of his command emboldens him. High on the terrifying charisma of his clothing, he invents a secret mission from the Führer and embarks on a brutal odyssey of torture and slaughter.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018Shooting in Poland and Germany in knife-edged black and white, the cinematographer, Florian Ballhaus, adds uncomfortable visual heat to Herold’s ice-cold cruelties. Through camera angles and lighting, in God’s-eye views and in carefully staged close encounters, his images pinpoint the tension between real and fake authority and the ways we determine which is which. And while there’s a grotesque comedy to Herold’s gang of dupes and opportunists as it trundles from one atrocity to another, the script’s emphasis on the transactional nature of power is too chilling to encourage chuckles. We can almost see characters figure out which side their Schwarzbrot is buttered on.In the publicity notes, Mr. Schwentke says he’s not interested in the architects of National Socialism, so much as the “back row” people who maintained its cover. And as we watch Herold gain confidence in his deception, sliding from fearful fugitive to pitiless con man, we see how the allure of a uniform might sicken its wearer as well as subjugate its followers. His swift embrace of depravity — and the self-interested silence of those who see through his ruse — gives “The Captain” a distressing inevitability that can make the viewer feel helpless, as if the seductiveness of fascism were stronger than its terrors.The real Herold fought in Italy as a paratrooper and, at one point, had an estimated 80 soldiers under his fake command. Movie Herold, sadly, remains an enigma, as his director seems more keen to place human nature, in a general sense, under scrutiny — to sniff out the reasons so many were willing to hitch their wagons to an emperor who really had no clothes at all."

But it’s the interviews — watching patients recount agonies they’ve suffered from poorly researched and regulated medical devices — that are hardest to sit through.“When it comes to medical devices, we built a system that doesn’t work” for proper regulation, says Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The multibillion dollar industry has exploited those flaws, and Kirby Dick (“The Invisible War,” “Twist of Faith”), the documentary’s director, spotlights infuriating examples and conflicts of interest.We learn of former F.D.A. officials hired by companies they once regulated, and see business executives named to government positions. That revolving door has been reported elsewhere, and often. Yet as outlined here, corporate influence has reached a point that might seem comical were patients’ lives not being wrecked.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 18, 2018Mr. Dick smartly summarizes complex procedures and cites exasperating statistics. His script is better still at introducing people affected by the products. The interviewers — Amy Ziering, aided by Amy Herdy and Mr. Dick — coax out dozens of quotes and anecdotes you’ll wish were heard by every government official.Ana Fuentes, a mother of four, chose Essure as a contraceptive. She and others say they have experienced excruciating pain since being implanted with it. (Last week, Bayer, the maker of Essure, said it will end sales of the device.) Ms. Fuentes says she is now unable to work because of complications. Her experiences described here, and the toll they take on her children, are heartbreaking.Stephen Tower, a physician, received a chrome-cobalt replacement hip, which he suspects poisoned him and led to a mental breakdown. Another segment, on complications said to be caused by vaginal mesh, is particularly harrowing; the mesh, whose potential to create serious problems was long known, “costs about $25 to bring to market, and they sell for about $2,000,” says an obstetrician. In such cases, if there’s a disagreement between the marketing and the medicine, “the marketing is always going to win out,” says a lawyer for injured patients.A sales representative, whose identity is shielded, discusses financial incentives used to coax surgeons to implant devices: “It’s gotten worse over time because of greed.” An onscreen statistic notes that medical companies paid doctors more than $2 billion in 2016.“The Bleeding Edge” isn’t an anti-medical film, but a look at calamities caused when the obsession for profit overwhelms an industry. Mr. Dick uses no devious camera tricks, and the soundtrack, by Jeff Beal, is tense yet restrained. Indeed, the filmmakers aren’t shouting “Fire” in a crowded theater. For them and their subjects, the inferno has already occurred. Now they’re sweeping up the ashes, and warning of new blazes sure to come."

To the Movies” is funny enough that you may just forgive its annoyingly placed exclamation point.Based on a Cartoon Network series derived from a DC comic book, the animated comedy features a team of adolescent superheroes led by Robin (Scott Menville), that perennial second-fiddle to Batman. Frustrated by his subordinate status, he enlists his cohorts — Beast Boy (Greg Cipes), Cyborg (Khary Payton), Raven (Tara Strong) and Starfire (Hynden Walch) — to find a deadly villain to fight. If he conquers evil he’ll earn respect, Robin figures. Far more important, he’ll get a movie deal.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018It’s an amusing tale for young audiences, ending with the expected messages about friendship and courage. But there are delights for adults as well, particularly in the first half, with sendups of various comic book series (some aimed at DC’s own arch-nemesis, Marvel) and an extra-large supply of spoofs on other movies.“Deadpool” and “Green Lantern” are satirized, while “Batman” and fellow franchises are lampooned for their catchphrases, special effects and sequels. Older references are also checked: Marlon Brando’s role in the 1978 “Superman” is remembered with affection; “Back to the Future” is called on for a quick laugh, as is “The Lion King.”The prevailing attitude is feisty rather than snide, with music thrown in, too: the cheeky “Upbeat Inspirational Song About Life,” sung by Michael Bolton, is among the cleverest moments. Kristen Bell, Jimmy Kimmel and Nicolas Cage voice assorted characters (with Mr. Cage as Superman, a role he once planned to play in a project that fell apart — another insider joke here), while Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics legend, makes a few cameos.As the action progresses, the gags diminish. Just after the halfway point, “Teen Titans,” directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, starts racing to wrap up its story lines. That’s probably wise. The movie’s best parts aren’t in the plot, anyway — they’re in the parodies."

Brutal villain? Check. Persistent love interest? Check. Classic “follow that car” sequence? Yes, that too. The director Daniel Zelik Berk has pulled together the elements of a spy film and set them against the optimism radiating from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Berlin is the base of the Mossad agent Ari Ben-Zion (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) until an assignment goes south and he heads home for a psychological evaluation. Among other destabilizing factors is his grief, still fresh, after his young son has died and his marriage self destructed.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 11, 2018When Israeli agents in Syria are compromised, John Hurt, as the Mossad director, (Mr. Hurt’s last role), sends Ari there on a many-layered mission to extract a valuable asset.Posing as Hans Hoffmann, a German businessman, Ari must take on the distasteful task of cozying up to Nazis living in Damascus. There he runs into Kim Johnson (Olivia Thirlby), an unconvincing photojournalist who fell at his feet earlier in Jerusalem while trying to shove her camera in the faces of some Orthodox Jews on the Sabbath.As one Syrian character tells another, “Timing is everything in this business,” and timing is only one flawed aspect of this uneven movie. It glosses over crucial details, such as why Ari changed course in the middle of his assignment, adding to the confused plot. These problems, along with awkwardly framed hand-to-hand combat and gun battles leave the viewer hungry for a slickly executed espionage movie.The overarching idea of “Damascus Cover,” though, provides a worthy payoff: the idea that there are alliances that transcend religious wars and nationalistic sentiments for the sake of saving lives."

Ethan, a brilliant scientist in the making, learns that lesson too late in “Our House,” an overly familiar but elegantly suspenseful throwback to the 1980s, when Steven Spielberg dominated as a director and producer. Ethan’s efforts to invent wireless electricity don’t do much to illuminate unplugged light bulbs, but they do conjure something extra-dimensional, and it’s probably not something good.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018Ethan (Thomas Mann), has a motivation to open Pandora’s box. When his parents die in a car accident he abruptly halts his experimentation so he can work to support his siblings, Matt (Percy Hynes White) and Becca (Kate Moyer). Matt blames Ethan: Had Ethan not been away the night of the crash, the parents might not have been driving. The prospect of having them back, even spectrally, is tough to resist.If Ethan, at first, seems blithely oblivious to conventional wisdom against playing God, the director, Anthony Scott Burns, is better at following rules. Self-consciously derivative, “Our House” comes furnished with a prominently placed poster for “The Fly,” characters who make references to “Back to the Future” and visual homages to “The Shining.”But while Mr. Burns hasn’t fully digested his influences, he has learned from them. “Our House” distinguishes itself with its purposeful pacing — the first real jump scare arrives more than a third of the way through — its use of sound and crosscutting, and its wit with household objects, from a turntable to a mechanical calendar."

It might also make you a little bit sleepy — which, in a multiplex reverberating with action-movie agita, can be an excellent effect for a movie to have.Which is not to say that this low-key, high-stakes domestic drama is boring — not at all. But it does have a narrative and performative rhythm that’s cozy-comforting. It starts with the music, a tinkling, lonely-soul piano refrain that hovers around Agnes (Kelly Macdonald), a blue-collar housewife in her early 40s with a loving husband, Louie (David Denman), and two grown sons, Ziggy and Gabe (Bubba Weiler and Austin Abrams).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018We meet her fussing around their Connecticut home, tending to guests as a birthday party winds down. The party is hers, yet she seems disengaged from the festivities, her smile forced and a little sad. Then she finds a jigsaw puzzle among her presents — a map of the world, wouldn’t you know — and completes it so quickly that she immediately wants to try another. For this timid homebody, assembling the pieces is a transformative act, the visual suggestion of a world of possibilities and a reminder of forgotten talents. First, though, she must brave the train ride to New York City, where puzzles galore and second chances await.Adapted from Natalia Smirnoff’s 2009 Argentine film of the same title, Oren Moverman and Polly Mann’s screenplay is gently sincere, seeing no humor in Agnes’s midlife disquiet and country-mouse artlessness. No marital meanness or dramatic blowups disturb the calm of a plot that keeps its discreetly roiling emotions on the inside. Ms. Macdonald gives a lovely uncertainty to her character’s gradual empowerment, but Agnes is so battened down that it’s hard to get a lock on her (a trait she shares with Ziggy, whose similar unhappiness and intuitive connection to his mother make for the movie’s most touching subplot).As it happens, the only thing that screams in this film is metaphor, with symbolism whimpering on the sidelines. So when Agnes is introduced to the world of competitive puzzling by Robert (the marvelous Irrfan Khan), a wealthy Indian inventor, his rumpled cosmopolitan glamour and dark-eyed wisdom seem the stuff of fairy tales. Gazing at him as if he were some exotic beast, the ashes of Lent fresh on her forehead, Agnes crosses his threshold and into a new life. It might not be the one she expects."

This other guy is well organized, polite and an engaging performer who can easily get a coffeehouse audience to sing along with him. During one such show, a flabbergasted Llewyn asks his friend, who admires this fellow, “Does he have a higher function?”That unkind question passed through my mind while I was watching “Hot Summer Nights,” written and directed by Elijah Bynum, who is making his feature debut. The movie opens during a hurricane, with a teenager named Daniel driving dangerously through the wind and rain in a snazzy sports car. Daniel, played by Timothée Chalamet (whose cachet is unlikely to be enhanced by the Shia LaBeouf riffs he reproduces here), is in trouble. After another car slams into his, the movie, set in the early 1990s, goes back several months, to the beginning of the summer.At that time, Daniel, a city kid unnerved by the death of his father, is dispatched to Hyannis, Mass., by his even more unnerved mother. A colorful montage of various adolescents from different social strata establishes the beach town’s hierarchies. Neither a townie nor a rich-kid summer resident, the skinny but cocky Daniel takes notice of two fellow teenagers: the hunky drug dealer and local legend, Hunter (Alex Roe), and the preternaturally attractive tough girl, McKayla (Maika Monroe).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018Daniel wants what Hunter has, which is a lot of cash to throw around. And he just plain wants McKayla. So does every other boy in town, says the movie’s unnamed narrator, who’s looking back from a distance of years but speaking as his teenage self. As a demonstration, he regales us with a scene in which a fellow grabs McKayla’s recently discarded chewing gum from the underside of the shelf below a public phone and unhesitatingly places it in his mouth.Not a lot of people watch Terrence Malick’s “Days of Heaven” and ask why Linda, its young narrator, speaks as the kid she was during the times she’s recounting. It’s poetic license that’s been carefully applied for, and we accept it. With the trite “Hot Summer Nights,” not so much. Admittedly, a teenager describing McKayla in the drooling terms used here is ostensibly more forgivable and (arguably) less creepy than a grown man would be, uttering the same superlatives. But still, the episode and the movie’s attitude toward McKayla are ickily sexist.As Daniel pursues his ambitions in romance and illegal commerce — complicated by Hunter’s being McKayla’s estranged brother, and still protective of her — the movie also nods to other directors. More accurately, it frantically waves to Wes Anderson (the camera work in the Hyannis social-whirl sequences) and to Paul Thomas Anderson (the drug-deal-gone-wrong sequence and the vintage Can song featured much more appropriately on the soundtrack of that director’s “Inherent Vice”). The influence of Joel and Ethan Coen, who made “Inside Llewyn Davis,” is also strong.Perhaps this picture’s higher function is to be a calling card. But I don’t know what a calling-card project that demonstrates that its maker can semi-successfully mimic artistically vital but uncommercial directors is supposed to prove. For me, it mostly proved a waste of time."

Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger. As usual, he works hard for our dollars and eyeballs in a movie that spins the oldies (a blonde with a knife in her garter) while pushing to greater spectacle-cinema extremes.ImageTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in “Mission: Impossible — Fallout.” Mr. Cruise does his own stunts. (Yes, that is real windswept hair.)CreditChiabella James/Paramount PicturesOnce again, Mr. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, who leads a crypto government unit called Impossible Missions Force that is as preposterous, politically dubious and near-magical as it was in the mid-1960s when the TV show first hit, latex masks and all. More than a half-century later, this impossible team’s leader is still receiving operational details via a self-destructing recording (should he choose to accept) and leaping unto the breach with his second bananas. Their numbers have shrunk over time, so now it’s a lonely guys’ club that includes the gruff Luther (Ving Rhames), who’s some kind of tech guy, and the rabbity Benji (Simon Pegg), another tech guy with more, faster patter.This is the sixth installment in this long-running series, and while I’ve seen all the movies at least once, the only entry that left a lasting visual imprint on me is the 1996 kickoff directed by Brian De Palma. That one of course features the series-defining image of Mr. Cruise suspended just inches above the floor. Since then, directors have come and gone, but only the latest, Christopher McQuarrie, has returned for repeat duty. Mr. Cruise’s affable, relaxed performance here suggests why. Mr. McQuarrie understands that the looser his star, often the looser (and better) the performance. “Fallout” has plenty of serious interludes, but its overall tone is borderline breezy, with bullets.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018The movie is propelled by action scenes that transmit a little something about the characters while nudging the story forward, much like the song-and-dance numbers in a musical. Fairly early, Ethan meets a slinky entrepreneur-operative called the White Widow (the charismatic Vanessa Kirby, who played Princess Margaret in the Netflix series “The Crown”). She’s the one with the shiv in her garter. Before she slides it out, Ethan and an unwelcome new partner, Walker (a fine Henry Cavill), ambush a villain (Liang Yang) in a men’s bathroom. The setting and Mr. Cavill’s pornstache and strapping masculinity invest the scene with titillating possibility: Is this an operation or a hookup?It’s both, in a way, but like an Astaire and Rogers number it’s simply flirty. Much of the fight involves the display of beautiful male bodies, which is punctuated by Ethan’s obvious exasperation having to partner with the younger, taller, bigger Walker. But Mr. McQuarrie also plays with the location using some winking staging in a men’s stall that introduces levity amid the blows. He’s teasing us with the location — we’re the ones being flirted with — and by extension rumors about Mr. Cruise’s sexuality. The setup doesn’t fully work and could be read as an example of gay panic rather than a swat at it. But it shrewdly frames Mr. Cruise as being as self-aware as he is famously controlling.ImageVanessa Kirby as the White Widow, with a shiv in her garter.CreditChiabella James/Paramount PicturesAmid rapidly shifting tones — from slapstick light to grimly dire — the bathroom is soon demolished and its white surfaces predictably redecorated with a bold red accent. The fighting throughout the scene is meaty, intimate and increasingly, intensely visceral as the men grapple and grunt while they slam to the ground and against, and through, walls. (The stunt coordinator is Wade Eastwood.) The struggling can be unnerving; you wince at some of the more intense wallops and the fatal stakes they portend. Of course it’s also satisfying because each smackdown is followed by a resurrection, a shaky rise from the floor and a counterattack that telegraphs resolve, superiority and victory.The action sequences become more intricate, large-scale and spectacular as Ethan chases down the enemy across assorted striking locales by foot, car, motorcycle and helicopter. One of Mr. Cruise’s signatures as a star is that he does his own stunts, whether he’s underwater or airborne. These intense physical displays have long served as his most persuasive markers of authenticity; his toothy smile and persona may be contrived, but the motorcycle he races on helmetless and the wind that pummels him during a free-fall are anxiously real. His physicality is crucial to the success of the “Mission: Impossible” series, critical to the movies’ kick.ImageLiang Yang and Henry Cavill in the bathroom brawl.CreditChiabella James/Paramount PicturesThere’s real pleasure in the images of Mr. Cruise, tense yet nimble, zigzagging through Paris on a motorcycle or sliding a car across pavement. In the past there’s also been something discomforting about the apparent risks he’s taken, which are inevitably folded into the publicity campaigns and the entertainment coverage. There’s a strange, quasi-religious aspect to these exhibitions of near-sacrifice, one that turns Mr. Cruise — he almost died (again) for us — into a would-be martyr, though one who is obviously safe (alive!) and comfortably cosseted. Even the trajectory of this movie’s fights, from cavernous dark to Valhalla-like bright heights, suggests an emergent divinity.This makes Mr. Cruise’s sagging eyes and visible creases an interesting, complicating factor for this decades-long series. Mr. Cruise is now 56, and while obviously fitter than most mortals, he looks closer to his age than ever. Age is the one thing that he can’t control, which works for the character, making Ethan a touch more vulnerable. The movie draws attention to Ethan’s age, sometimes for laughs, though never truly at Mr. Cruise’s expense.The harder laughs are reserved for Mr. Cavill, who’s best known for playing Superman and is close to the age that Mr. Cruise was when the first “Mission: Impossible” opened. But Mr. Cavill will never be the star of this show, which Mr. Cruise reminds you as he plays God while gradually making acquaintance with his human self."

But those EMS workers are all men. And while life-threatening situations allow for some leeway in strict prohibitions on contact between the sexes, some women remained reluctant to call for help.As Hadassah Ellis, an EMS recruit in the documentary “93Queen,” puts it: These women have never held hands with anybody who are not their husbands — “and then suddenly there’s 10 men in her room while she’s exposed from the waist down?”“93Queen,” the feature debut of Paula Eiselt, follows the creation of Ezras Nashim, an all-female EMS corps for the Borough Park area, in Brooklyn, that started in 2014. The organization was controversial among some ultra-Orthodox Jews, who saw it as an erosion of traditional gender roles and a Trojan horse that invited secularism into their neighborhoods. (The difficulty of access for filming should be noted here: Ms. Eiselt identifies as Orthodox herself and, while serving as her own cinematographer, followed her subjects’ customs relating to modesty during shooting.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 17, 2018The film’s central figure is one of the group’s founders, Rachel Freier, known as Ruchie (she is now a civil court judge). She eschews labels like “feminist,” which, she says, among some Hasidim connotes women who want to overstep religious boundaries separating women from men — boundaries that Ruchie continues to observe.One of the biggest debates within Ezras Nashim as the corps gets underway is whether to allow single women to participate. Ms. Freier suggests that being married indicates that a woman is mature enough to handle being an EMT on call. At another moment, Ms. Ellis explains that accepting single women might give ammunition to Ezras Nashim’s detractors, because of a view she attributes to some rabbis that single women shouldn’t be exposed to situations the organization deals with.The obstacles go beyond that. Online messages accuse Ms. Freier, among other things, of challenging the Torah and playing with fire. Rabbis refuse to publicly endorse the enterprise. And once inaugurated, the service meets with a rash of prank phone calls and, initially, few legitimate ones.“93Queen” is not a groundbreaking documentary, but it does offer a more nuanced view of ultra-Orthodox Jews than is presented in films like “One of Us” from last year. Without denying that these women face discrimination in reaching their goal, the movie shows how its subjects are able to find ways to combine strict observance and progress. The contradictions aren’t always easy to square — the movie might benefit from certain basic details about how, say, Ezras Nashim and Hatzolah function during the unplugging that is part of observing Shabbat — but the movie’s upshot is heartening, even inspiring."

Recently arrived in a small Midlands town, the two are desperate to make friends. But Lyn, mentally slow and physically burdened, invites only the scorn of her neighbors, while Iona, geeky and ginger-haired, is a too-tempting target for the über-mean girls at her new high school. Brutally exploiting her social and sexual naïveté, they enact a campaign of escalating humiliations.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018Holding tight to both as they struggle to fit into a community that patently doesn’t want them, Ms. Haywood — who shot the film in her hometown and describes it as “emotionally biographical” — fashions a portrait of mental illness and extreme bullying that can be tough to watch. Deliberately exaggerating every cruelty, she shows how slights are magnified when you’re young or otherwise vulnerable. Backing her up, the cinematographer, Nicola Daley, employs the colors of cartoons to amplify every emotion, overlaying her bright, muscular hues with gauze whenever Iona escapes into dreamy fantasies.Aligning perfectly with this hyperbole is a blizzard of whimsy in the costumes and set design: The movie looks as if a craft store exploded in Lyn and Iona’s living room. Yet while “Pin Cushion” might prove too distressing for some, it’s still peculiarly, undeniably original. Iona might seem more deserving of your sympathy, but it’s Lyn who could really crack your heart."

That is, like the first, all the action occurs within a computer screen. And as the first film had teenage friends (and the ghost of a teenager) tormenting each other online, this movie is also true to its title, exposing the seedier and more sinister sides of the internet.The ostensible protagonist, Matias (Colin Woodell), having purloined a snazzy laptop on the day of his online game night with pals both geographically local and far-flung, runs afoul of its actual owner. Matias and his friends learn, via hard drive examination and instant messaging, that said owner is potentially a serial home invader, possibly a serial torturer and, maybe, a serial murderer? Whatever you think the situation might be at any given minute, it gets worse.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018The writer Stephen Susco makes his feature directing debut here, but he’s an old hand at tricky contemporary horror, having written the 2004 United States remake of “The Grudge” and its sequel, among others. What’s striking in this movie, apart from an ostentatiously glitchy screen distortion that occurs whenever a denizen of the “dark web” appears on one of the screens within screens, is how credibly its extreme trolling plays. (I admit I raised an eyebrow on noting that a couple of the film’s producers are Russian.) Otherwise, the most effective way this maliciously clever little movie emulates life as it is lived online is by not giving you much time to really think about its implications (not to mention the plausibility of the story line)."

On either side, two giant robotic arms dip and turn, spraying her with dye until the white froth of her dress is streaked in black and citron. It’s a gorgeous assault that leaves her defiled, yet strangely exultant.Triumph over abuse was a motif that the British fashion designer Alexander McQueen (who died in 2010) returned to repeatedly in his legendary runway shows, as Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui’s compassionate documentary, “McQueen,” reveals. In simulated settings like a mental hospital or a Highland moor, his models turned violence into performance and suffering into story. Their garments — often cunningly tattered or fabulously deconstructed — weren’t always wearable, but were impossible to disregard.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018Dazzling and divisive, these shows are the backbone of “McQueen,” and the directors wisely drape the movie’s psychological insights (courtesy of a parade of friends, family and collaborators) around them. A trove of catwalk footage presents McQueen’s artistry as both a manifestation of childhood wounds and an indictment of the fashion industry’s mistreatment of models. This lends the beauty of his work an ache that radiates throughout a film that simultaneously acknowledges the complexity of his influences while distracting from their diversity.Feeling less like a celebration than a fond farewell, “McQueen” successfully steers clear of hagiography, yet has its share of omissions and missteps. There’s virtually no footage of the work itself, of the sheer graft involved in creating a collection, and Michael Nyman’s score can be annoyingly pushy. Yet the filmmakers’ emphasis on drama honors the driven personality of their subject, while tracing a fairly conventional glad-rags-to-riches narrative arc: The sweet, blue-collar lad from London’s East End who catapulted from using fabric bought with his dole money to designing for Givenchy and Gucci.He would fall almost as quickly, done in by drugs, residual demons and the stress of mounting more than a dozen shows a year. It’s a story begging to be transformed into a television series by Ryan Murphy — someone else who understands, as McQueen did, how to shape trauma into art."

One of the reigning symbolic patriarchs of genre cinema — a fraternity that includes Clint Eastwood, Liam Neeson and the rather less-convincing Bruce Willis — Mr. Washington has been meting out extreme punishment for some time. He’s especially persuasive playing the kind of brutal redeemers who unblinkingly snuff out the murderous many to save a single innocent, which is exactly what he does at the start of “The Equalizer 2.”The violently avenging hero is a durable American archetype, and denying it — and the indefensible, irresistible pleasures of watching primitive justice in action — is probably pointless at this stage in our history. For decades, the TV producer Dick Wolf, the diabolical genius behind the “Law & Order” franchise, has profited from the reassuring spectacle of professionals balancing (usually) the scales of justice. Although the holy spirit of Gregory Peck’s Atticus Finch hovers over many cinematic courtrooms, movies have often seemed more satisfying when they forget order and the law and serve up justice as cold (and blood-red) as possible.We’re clearly not meant to worry about the niceties — legal, ethical, narrative — while watching “The Equalizer 2.” We are meant to watch, and to cheer. It’s forgivable if you don’t remember anything about the original (I didn’t), which blurs with all the other movies in which Mr. Washington has played characters who righteously or just summarily deliver death to the deserving: “The Magnificent Seven,” “The Book of Eli,” “Man on Fire” and so on. He has played his share of decent, morally assured and even bland characters, but, like so many of the greatest American male stars, violence becomes him.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018In some ways, Mr. Washington plays the role once embodied by John Wayne, except that the fight now usually takes place in cities instead of the wild West of Hollywood’s own Manifest Destiny. Antoine Fuqua, the excitable director of “The Equalizer 2,” traces a line between his star and the Duke by alluding to one of the most famous shots in film history: Wayne framed in a doorway in “The Searchers,” the closing frontier stretched out behind him. The allusion is more ritualistic nod than anything else, and there’s little otherwise in “The Equalizer 2” that connects it to “The Searchers” other than the bluntly obvious: the near-mythic status of its stars and our very American love of violence.However much separates these two movies — story, craft, technique, production context, the larger world, you name it — they both hinge on a familiar American defender-savior: the resolute, physically imposing, quite possibly deranged solitary older man who sets wrongs right. In each film, the hero roughly takes a younger, less-hardened man under his wing, giving the audience a surrogate, someone to cling to when things or the avenger get too weird or uncomfortably rough. That role here is played with glimmers of feeling by Ashton Sanders, the memorably delicate teenage protagonist of “Moonlight.”In “The Equalizer 2,” Mr. Sanders plays Miles, a student and would-be artist who’s started to stray and who lives in the same homey Boston apartment complex as Mr. Washington’s character, Robert McCall. To his neighbors, McCall surely seems a good neighbor: reserved, helpful, friendly without being pushy. He watches over the building with a sharp eye — Mr. Fuqua has a serious ocular thing going on in this movie — and a secret arsenal. He draws from his stash now and again when he’s not quietly reading in his monastic apartment or driving for Lyft, picking up souls who, with one unruly exception, he benevolently observes in the rearview mirror.Written by Richard Wenk (his name can be found on some of Mr. Washington’s earlier sanguineous vehicles), “The Equalizer 2” has a whole lot going on. Mostly, it has McCall and the characters who rotate around his divine radiance, notably Miles, who’s in need of a drastic course correction. (A believer in tough love, McCall gives him a stern talking-to delivered at gunpoint and a copy of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s book “Between the World and Me.”) There’s also Sam (Orson Bean), a shameless cliché in need of rescue and a rewrite, and Susan (an effective Melissa Leo), McCall’s only friend and a retired Central Intelligence Agency officer who still takes care of classified business.The story skips from Turkey to Boston and elsewhere as McCall smoothly juggles crises, regularly pausing to break someone’s bones. Mr. Fuqua handles all this with his customary visual flamboyance, using different speeds, off-kilter angles and ophthalmological close-ups of McCall’s eyes to convey his near-mystical abilities. Mr. Washington is especially strong when he trusts his director, as he did with Tony Scott and does with Mr. Fuqua. Like all great actors, Mr. Washington commits to the performance, but every so often he also breathes fire, imbuing a scene with such shocking ferocity and bone-deep moral certitude that everything else falls blissfully away."
"2279","Generation Wealth","R",0,"JEANNETTE CATSOULIS","Review: ‘Generation Wealth’ Examines Toxic Materialism","Lauren Greenfield’s emotionally complicated documentary looks deeper into our obsession with money and status.","2018-07-19","2018-07-20","2018-08-17 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/movies/generation-wealth-review-lauren-greenfield.html,Read the New York Times Review of Generation Wealth,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/20/arts/20generation1/generation1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"“I loooove money” are among the first words we hear in “Generation Wealth,” Lauren Greenfield’s crammed compendium of capitalist excesses and toxic materialism. They’re spoken by the former hedge fund manager Florian Homm, a louche and rueful mansplainer of the collapse of American fiscal responsibility. Since becoming a longtime fugitive from the F.B.I., it seems the scales of greed have fallen from his eyes.Lust for wealth followed by regretful mea culpas (genuine or otherwise) is something of a pattern in this deeply depressing, emotionally complicated documentary. For 25 years, Ms. Greenfield, a photojournalist and anthropologist of the privileged, has observed their rituals and addictions with a keen eye for the person beneath the designer logos. Best known for her 2012 documentary, “The Queen of Versailles” — about a billionaire couple’s attempt to replicate a French chateau in Orlando, Fla. — her work functions both as vulgar voyeurism and social criticism.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018Playing like a greatest-hits compilation with bonus tracks, “Generation Wealth” revisits some of those former subjects — the billionaire couple; a Las Vegas über-hostess; an impossibly fragile-looking adult film star — to see how they’ve fared. Not well, by and large: many seem damaged and drained, sad victims of an obsession that neither our society nor this movie has a cure for. The revelation that the longed-for lifestyles of the flush and famous don’t always confer happiness isn’t a surprise; but perhaps it should be, the film seems to say. That it’s not only underscores the cynicism with which wealth is so often pursued.And it’s the pursuit, even more than the acquisition of lucre, that’s the movie’s true subject. From an Atlanta strip club where cash-crazy dancers rake bills off the floors, to a school where aspirational Chinese learn to pronounce essential phrases like Dolce & Gabbana, Ms. Greenfield’s work pokes insistently at the psychological spaces we hope money and status can fill.Wobbling uncertainly between sensationalism and studiousness, “Generation Wealth” might seem simply a marketing adjunct to her 2017 breeze-block of a book and exhibition of photographs. Darting from micro to macro and back again, squashing obscene consumption against child beauty pageants and ruinous debt, its structure makes for an unfocused thesis.The through line, though, works, as Ms. Greenfield repeatedly turns her camera on her own family and career choices. Fretting over endeavors that have kept her so often away from her two delightfully articulate sons, she binds the film’s far-flung concerns before coming to rest on a spot she’s been aiming at all along: Love matters more than money. But we already knew that — didn’t we?"

But its goal is similar: The director, Rachel Dretzin, and Mr. Solomon, a professor of clinical psychology who is both a producer and an on-camera presence here, set out to explore families in which parents and children differ profoundly, whether because of innate factors (Down syndrome, dwarfism) or divergences (the film introduces us to a mother and father whose son was convicted of murder).The lone holdover from the book is Jason, who has Down syndrome (as a child, he made regular appearances on “Sesame Street”) and sometimes struggles to tease out fiction from reality. He longs to travel to Norway because he harbors a crush on Elsa from “Frozen,” a yearning that his mother attributes to a desire to feel attached to someone who can’t leave him following the death of his father.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018There is Jack, a teenager with autism who is unable to speak. Thanks to old video footage, Ms. Dretzin is able to show us a breakthrough at a clinic in Austin when Jack used a stencil-letter tool to communicate with his parents. Wearing noise-canceling earbuds, he gets straight A’s and — joking as he prepares for dental work — is unafraid to show a sense of humor.Mr. Solomon also relates, sometimes superfluously in this context, his own life story, and how his acceptance of being gay influenced the writing of the book. Like some of the conditions in the film, homosexuality was once regarded as an illness but is now seen as an identity — a shift toward acceptance whose implications hover over the rest of the movie. We meet Leah and Joe, a married couple with dwarfism who are hoping to have a child. Leah wants a little person, but if her child is average-sized, she says, she’ll understand the dynamic intuitively, because she grew up different from those raising her.The outlier here is the family of Trevor, who killed an 8-year-old when he was 16 and ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. Although the shame has reverberated for the family (Trevor’s siblings are reluctant to have children of their own), the emphasis here is on how Trevor’s former household has coped. (“You love your children,” his mother says. “You don’t get to choose to love them.”)While the segment is thought-provoking, its feints at uplift feel forced and dubious — a way of smoothing over the complications in Mr. Solomon’s ideas about differences and happiness."

Even the filmmaker seems to have boxed the defendant in: The movie opens with the defendant bashing in the victim’s head and then burning the corpse. A trial seems almost beside the point, a view that the writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda goes on to dismantle with lapidary precision.Mr. Kore-eda is best known for his movies about families, including “Like Father, Like Son,” a heart-shredding story about two boys swapped at birth. With a quiet, adamantly moral sensibility and unassuming yet exacting technique, he tells seemingly small stories that grow deeper and more emotionally complex one nuance at a time. His technique can be so unassertive that if you aren’t paying attention you might not even notice it. He avoids pyrotechnics and look-at-me camerawork and editing, preferring to thicken and deepen his stories with suggestively revealing details: a critical word, gesture or glance. At times his emphatic discretion can verge on mannerism, but not here.For Shigemori (Masaharu Fukuyama) the case seems fairly straightforward. His client, Takashi Misumi (Koji Yakusho), has confessed that he killed his former boss. Misumi was in prison for several decades for two other murders and will probably face the death penalty if he’s found guilty. It all looks straightforward and fairly hopeless, but Shigemori sets off on his own investigation in an effort to reduce the charge and possibly save Misumi’s life. He’s aided by some employees (a decorative woman and two men, one seasoned and the other wide-eyed) and his father, a retired judge who presided over Misumi’s previous murder trial.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018Mr. Kore-eda is a smooth enough storyteller that this coincidence doesn’t disrupt the flow too much. Instead, he pulls you along as Shigemori begins his inquiry, visiting the murder scene, rooting out witnesses and poking around in the past. Facts and faces begin piling up along with additional coincidences as daughters start to multiply. Misumi’s adult daughter figures into the story somewhat obliquely as does Shigemori’s pouty teenage daughter, Yuka (Aju Makita). She in turn becomes a strange twin to the murder victim’s daughter, Sakie (Suzu Hirose), a lonely adolescent with a pronounced limp and plaintive mien who was curiously close with Misumi.In contrast to the usual law and order tales, the more that Shigemori uncovers about the case the murkier everything appears. He pores over the evidence and grapples with enigmas, like the ashy crosslike shape where the body was found and a small, tidy animal grave that’s been marked with its own cross. Again and again, he returns to the detention center where Misumi is being held, prodding and poking his client. Shigemori is seeking answers, and sometimes he gets them, though they don’t necessarily shed light on the case, as when Misumi explains that the reason he paid his rent in advance even though he had planned on being arrested: “You don’t pay rent in prison.”This observation is indicative of Mr. Kore-eda’s humanizing of Misumi, a character who nevertheless remains satisfyingly slippery. He clearly committed the murder, as the story regularly reminds you. During his inquiries, Shigemori examines surveillance images recorded in a taxi after the murder: Nothing if not obliging, the blood-splashed Misumi politely asked to be driven to a police station. The back and forths between accused and lawyer are among the movie’s most enthralling scenes, largely because the soft-featured Mr. Yakusho — lips lightly curling — can make a nice smile seem positively terrifyingly. (The actor probably remains best known to audiences in the United States for his charming star turn in the original version of “Shall We Dance?”)At times, Mr. Kore-eda pushes too hard and overstates the obvious, as when he superimposes images of Misumi and Shigemori’s faces, as if to underscore that the two are more alike than not. He’s making a fine ethical point but it’s an overly blunt cinematic stroke. Far better is an earlier scene in which Shigemori and his daughter share little but a restaurant booth and their mutual estrangement. He’s had to rescue her from some trouble and asks why she cried. She shows that she can weep on cue — and as Mr. Kore-eda, who uses close-ups with devastating results — fills the screen with her manufactured tears everything seems to crumble, Shigemori and the truth included."

You want to make a sequel to a very popular movie (based on an even more popular musical) whose best asset was Meryl Streep, a very famous actor, who after decades of intergalactic acclaim, was unveiled, at last, as a major movie star. And you’re going to make that film — “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” — with every other member of the movie’s original cast, except for her but including poor Pierce Brosnan, whose singing, as a lovelorn widower, remains a dare to file a noise complaint.And you’re going to keep the musical’s Abba-centric conceit — only you used up all the great Abba songs the first time. So now you’ve got to lean on second- and third-tier stuff like “My Love, My Life,” “I’ve Been Waiting for You” and “Kisses of Fire.” And because you suspect some of us might, not unreasonably, prefer numbers set to “Dancing Queen” and “Waterloo,” and because you’re running embarrassingly low on credible options, you recycle those songs, but with as little movie-musical imagination as you can get away with.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 10, 2018Now you don’t have Ms. Streep as Donna, the American proprietress of a Greek villa, and so because of scheduling, money, perhaps Ms. Streep’s dignity, you’ve killed Donna off. But you still need an element that lends the proceedings a whiff of showbiz. So you import the opposite of Meryl Streep. You import someone with one screen self (and one name!) as opposed to dozens, someone with buoyancy, immortality and a welcome sense of campiness, someone who can sing. You bring in Cher. But you don’t bring her aboard to play Donna’s sister, childhood bestie, long-lost lover or even rival Mediterranean hotelier. You hire Cher (who’s 72 to Ms. Streep’s 69) to play — oh, I can’t. Do I have to?You hire Cher to play …Her mother.It takes about 90 minutes to get here. Because, in part, the movie, which Ol Parker wrote and directed, has to thumb-twiddle with a plot involving the grand reopening of Donna’s villa by her daughter, Sophie, who’s still played with a damsel’s distress by Amanda Seyfried. Oh, the stress. Will any of her three fathers — Stellan Skarsgard, Colin Firth and Mr. Brosnan — show up? Will her boyfriend, Sky (Dominic Cooper), or her mother’s best friends (Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, lascivious as ever)? And what about that catastrophic storm from the first movie? Yes, yes, yes, and yes — but it’s a pitiful cinematic event, especially compared with Hurricane Cher.When she does arrive, it’s almost ominously — by chopper, the way, in “Zero Dark Thirty,” the SEALs sneak up on Osama bin Laden, or how, on “Game of Thrones,” a dragon might invade Westeros. She’s Ruby, some kind of Vegas-encrusted entertainment legend who arrives in a bleach-blond wig and an outfit made with the pelts of a dozen disco balls. Meryl Streep’s mother? LOL. Lady Gaga’s younger sister? Bingo.ImageCher pops up, almost ominously, in “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.”CreditUniversal PicturesI know. It’s weird to fixate on a person who shows up with only 20 minutes to go. But believe me, it’s no hardship abandoning all the flashbacks to the tail end of the 1970s and the opening bits of the 1980s, when an obnoxiously blissed out 20-something Donna, who’s played by Lily James, sleeps her way around southern France and Greece, and does so immaculately, it must be said.These are monotonous interludes meant to expand on and explain the legend of Donna — how she turned her university valediction into “When I Kissed the Teacher,” a number that not even the Muppets would endorse; how she wound up pregnant with a daughter of uncertain paternity; how she turned a bunch of dust and debris into the sort of seaside splendor you find only in a Nancy Meyers movie. It’s cruel to put an actor in the cross hairs of Streepists. So Ms. James deserves some credit for agreeing to make herself a target. And even though she did nothing for me (she’s ruthlessly plucky with young Donna’s platitudes), I’ll admit to admiring her choice to not even bother “doing” Meryl Streep. She seems a lot likelier to wind up as Dyan Cannon, a star of eventually spiked loveliness who is to Ms. Streep what a Lakers hat is to Carmen Miranda’s.In the first movie, Ms. Streep luxuriated in a mode other than technical virtuosity. The director Phyllida Lloyd launched her upward toward the camera as a nifty metaphor for stardom. Now she’s haunting the new movie courtesy of what looks like an unflatteringly framed publicity still from the previous one. It’d be unhappier if it weren’t also passive-aggressive. The movie won’t let us miss her!Her incandescence was an asset. It both attracted and blinded you to what, ultimately, was a movie about the pernicious allure of cultural imperialism. (You mean, a Greek enclave full of Brits, Americans and Mr. Skarsgard singing hits by Swedes couldn’t find even one vaguely Hellenic arrangement?)Ms. Streep’s near total absence leaves a hole Cher is expected to fill. It’s too little, way too late, of course, and because it’s Cher, it’s also too much. The movie doesn’t know what to do with her, anyway. For one thing, the camera maintains a mysterious, disturbing distance. Her appearance does weakly justify all the Latin-lover hot air that Andy Garcia has to blow as Sophie’s glorified help. (His face is safely hidden behind a thicket of gray bearding.) But she’s so natural (and spectral) here that you don’t know why they didn’t just build a different movie around her and her decades of hits. Although, she’s no dummy. Her own collection of Abba covers is coming, and, as I write this, “The Cher Show” hurtles toward Broadway. So maybe her work here is best appreciated as a pop-up ad.Mr. Parker does give the movie these flashes of old, literal-minded Hollywood staging, like when young Donna’s virginal suitor (Hugh Skinner) shoots “Waterloo” all over a French restaurant. But most of the movie’s 18 numbers just kind of sit there. You don’t feel much. So even when you get a goodie like “Dancing Queen,” wherein a lot of tan and actual brown people gyrate in unison on landward boats, you can simultaneously admire a perfect pop song and spare a thought for the real boat-bound migrants who’ve perished in waters just like these.Most of the musical sequences are creaky, but not that far from some of what Damien Chazelle was going for with the singing and dancing in “La La Land”: passionate amateurism. But that’s some of what made the first movie such a kick. Nobody was Barbra Streisand. None of the songs were Stephen Sondheim’s. You were watching very good actors do karaoke in an Anglo-Nordic telenovela. Now you’re watching them do it in a sequel, which means you’re also watching something more inscrutably sad: karaoke of karaoke."

One side shows a vibrant multiracial culture living in a frequently beleaguered environment; the other a gentrifying city whose newest residents — young, white, start-up-happy, new-money types — seem eager to embrace the area’s “authenticity,” as long as their interactions with its longtime residents don’t involve any real discomfort.Collin (Daveed Diggs), nearing the end of his probation for a felony we don’t learn much about until relatively late in the movie, initially confronts the “new” Oakland via a bottle of green juice now being sold at his regular bodega. It goes for 10 bucks a pop. Feeling flush on his way to his job at a moving company, he picks one up — partly to impress Val (Janina Gavankar), his ex-girlfriend, who works as the moving company’s receptionist and scheduler. “It’s part of my regimen now,” he tells her, unconvincingly. (He takes one sip and looks as if he’s about to be sick.)Looking good to Val is one of Collin’s many concerns. Anticipating getting sprung from a halfway house, he’s maintaining regular work hours and keeping his nose clean. His friends aren’t, it seems, completely dedicated to his cause. Collin’s best buddy from childhood and partner at the moving company gig is Miles (Rafael Casal). He’s white, while Collin is black. They sometimes like to recap their days and evenings by concocting rhymes together; this element of their friendship comes into crucial play at the movie’s nerve-grinding climax.Miles, despite having a child by the girlfriend with whom he lives, seems more devoted to being “street” than Collin is — he even wears a grill in his mouth — and when Miles illegally purchases a gun from a mutual friend for “house protection,” you just know that nothing good is going to come of it. But the movie’s first occasion of gunfire comes from the police.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 11, 2018Driving home one evening, nervous about making his 11 p.m. curfew, Collin witnesses a white cop shooting an unarmed black man. Near paralyzed at the sight, he’s ordered to move along — but not before locking eyes with the officer (Ethan Embry). The shooting makes the local television news, distorted from the reality of what Collin saw.One night while hanging out with Val, who’s studying psychology, Collin notices in her textbook an illustration called “Rubin’s Vase,” a set of two-dimensional forms that appear to be a vase or two human profiles depending on your perception of it. The changing social sets in Oakland are, in this movie, creating not just ambiguity but distortion. And as Collin approaches the end of his probation, he seems to gain clarity with respect to the victims of police brutality. They begin to haunt him even as he fails to see the immediate ways he’s putting his own life in danger.This movie, which was written by Mr. Diggs and Mr. Casal, has an energetic-to-the-point-of-boisterous style. Its lively frequency is embedded in the writing, bolstered by Carlos López Estrada’s direction, and kept buoyant by the performers. This particular aspect of the film makes it exciting to watch, but can also be confounding. “Blindspotting” often seems as if it wants to split the difference between its social concerns and its engagement level as an entertainment.The schematic nature of the movie’s story line and the on-the-nose quality of many of its observations can add to the frustration. My first impression was that “Blindspotting” worked best as a suspense narrative, with its countdown structure, ticking off the days before Collin’s probation ends. Collin is so appealingly portrayed by Mr. Diggs — a 2016 Tony winner for “Hamilton” — that you want him to be O.K. Indeed, the movie’s ultimate compassion is such that it makes you want everyone to be O.K., including Miles, who often just behaves like a straight-up knucklehead.But whatever my quibbles, the actual core of the movie is so pertinent that I’ve continued to think about it, hard, since I first saw it. (The same is true of another new, Oakland-set movie about race and American society, the outrageously affecting “Sorry to Bother You.”) What I took to be tonal inconsistency may actually be a form of dialectic. I unabashedly admire the movie’s aims, and think “Blindspotting” ought to be seen by the widest audience possible."

This one was to be based on “The Soft Centre,” a book by James Hadley Chase (who wrote the lurid and scandalous “No Orchids for Miss Blandish” in 1939, as well as “Eva,” which was made into a notable film by Joseph Losey in 1962). Drawing on his own frustrations in a new era of film production, Mr. Godard concocted a narrative that, like his movies “Contempt” (1963) and “Passion” (1982), chronicles a film that doesn’t get made.Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Gaspard Bazin, a frenetic, declaiming figure driven to distraction by, well, it’s hard to say what — although the implication is strong that he’s been broken by filmmaking itself. Mr. Léaud’s performance here is a marvel, both manic and meticulously controlled.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018Making a film of “The Soft Centre,” he uses the small offices of his producer, Jean Almereyda (Jean-Pierre Mocky, an actor and director who was a contemporary of Mr. Godard’s), to conduct elaborately ritualized auditions, creating assembly lines of emoting. He approaches women in bistros and requests that they come to his place for private auditions and that they bring their bathing suits. When they tell him that sounds shady, he responds, “That’s not our style.” (Sure enough, when they do show up, Bazin is sufficiently scattered and passive that you think maybe he wasn’t lying.) He does take a genuine interest in working with Almereyda’s wife, Eurydice (Marie Valera). Almereyda is too caught up in financing concerns to take much notice.The allusive character names and the absurdist spectacles of the depicted auditions suggest that the proceedings constitute an elaborate inside joke, which they do. (Bazin of course refers to the groundbreaking French film critic, mentor to François Truffaut and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Godard and several other critics turned filmmakers; Almereyda was the assumed name of the filmmaker Jean Vigo’s father; and you hopefully know who Eurydice was.) The effect is heightened when Mr. Godard himself shows up, playing the director Jean-Luc Godard. But his work never operates on just one level. Beneath the playfulness, there’s both genuine melancholy and anger; as ridiculous as the characters here can seem, the movie attaches them all to a palpable thread of anguish.“Mais c’est Godard!” Almereyda exclaims when the filmmaker materializes, an unlit cheroot in his mouth. The two get in the fictional producer’s car and discuss recent real-life events in the film world, including the 1985 drug overdose of the producer Jean-Pierre Rassam and the 1982 death of the actor Romy Schneider.As funny as Mr. Godard’s claim that he’s recently moved to Reykjavik, Iceland, to be closer to great chess is, his near prediction of what would become, in his own life and practice, a larger isolation from the ostensible center of French filmmaking here speaks to a disillusionment that has a genuine poignancy. In the most piquant of the film’s dozens of allusions, one of the central characters of “Rise and Fall” emerges from the inevitable shipwreck of the Hadley project to present himself for employment at another company, this one called Albatross Films. Cinema: Can’t live with it, can’t live without it."

The soft sounds of voices and the clinking of crockery as meals were prepared drifted through to the section of the elegant Belgrade apartment where the director Mila Turajlic grew up. Only much later would she learn what lay behind those doors, and why. Yet their eventual opening would liberate more than just the two rooms carved off and allotted to strangers by a long-ago government: It would help one woman decide it was time to pass the political baton.That woman is Srbijanka Turajlic, the director’s mother, a proud Yugoslav and the dynamic and fearless subject of “The Other Side of Everything.” A retired engineering professor and a prominent player in Serbia’s opposition movements, she leads us through the traumatic 1992 dissolution of Yugoslavia and its lingering bruise on her psyche and circle of friends. Srbijanka was just 2 years old when the new Communist government decided that her middle-class parents had too many rooms and installed additional, poorer families; it would be seven decades before the last would be gone and the rooms reclaimed.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018Spatially restricted yet ideologically free-ranging, this thoroughly absorbing documentary, shot mainly inside the apartment, details the family’s rich history within the fluctuating fortunes of Serbian democracy. It’s a story of police beatings and state surveillance, marches and speeches and the rousing, youth-led movement that would remove Slobodan Milosevic from power and which — in light of its divisive aftershocks — Srbijanka now regards as a “failed revolution.” Well-chosen archival footage brings her memories to life, but it’s the clarity of her thinking that dominates. A mind that views the pursuit of democratic freedoms and the long con of weaponized nationalism with subtlety and self-awareness is all too rare in any era.Engrossing despite its daunting scope and tangled politics, “The Other Side of Everything” offers an uncommon opportunity to view the shifting borders and identities of an entire region through the eyes of the Eastern European intellectuals caught in the turmoil. Filming mainly from 2012-17, the director invites air and light into her shots through the apartment’s wide-open windows, her camera revealing a leafy, upscale neighborhood whose embassies attract boisterous civic protests.Confrontation of all kinds is the movie’s unifying theme, tying personal to political and private to public in a story energized by the detailed memory and staunch pragmatism of its subject. All too often, Srbijanka explains, people overthrow their leaders with no clear plan of what to put in their place. Revolutions are fine; it’s what you do the day after that really matters."

This stunning documentary, directed by Jake Meginsky with the assistance of Neil Young (a musician, but no relation to the rock star) does not offer anything like a conventional biography or career trajectory of the percussionist, who was and continues to be a unique force in jazz.Among Mr. Graves’s signal achievements are his work with the pianist Paul Bley and his being a co-founder of the New York Art Quartet, an ensemble small in discography but enormous in influence. But this movie won’t tell you about that. Rather, “Milford Graves Full Mantis” throws you into the man’s world. (The title refers to a martial arts stance; Mr. Graves is a devotee.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018It opens with his own music playing underneath a montage of artifacts and instruments, scientific and musical, from the portion of his home in Queens (the exterior of which is beautifully adorned in stained glass and polished stones) that serves as his laboratory. It then cuts to some sizzling black-and-white footage of a 1973  performance. Even at its most frenetic and thundering, there’s a coherence to Mr. Graves’s drum work. That’s not an accident.Mr. Graves, 76, speaks in this movie about his studies of heartbeats and discusses how the false perception of a human pulse being somehow metronomic has created an equally false consciousness with respect to music.There are also anecdotes from his life, including a harrowing one about the shooting of one of his sons, and an uplifting one about performing for autistic children in Japan. You can get a lot of facts about Mr. Graves and his discography on the internet (and I recommend you do). This movie gives you, well, the man’s heart, and it’s a beautiful one."

At home, Nisha (the newcomer Maria Mozhdah, in an arresting performance) speaks Urdu and diligently maintains her grades so that she might one day become a doctor. But at school, she is indistinguishable from her Norwegian friends who wear makeup, sneak out of their homes at night and lust after boys while dancing to techno music.After Nisha spends a clandestine night out, her father, Mirza (Adil Hussain), catches her bringing a boy home. Her parallel lives collapse into chaos. Mirza beats the boy, who was not yet Nisha’s lover. With the help of extended family, he kidnaps his daughter and sends her to Pakistan, where she can be watched with surveillant strictness by her aunt and uncle.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 3, 2018Her family burns her passport, holding her under threat of abandonment, public humiliation and even death. As a result of her exile, Nisha is subjected to traumatic ordeals with such frequency and intensity that it becomes tempting to retreat into the false belief that it should be impossible for such terrible things to happen to one person. But the film is based in part on the director Iram Haq’s own experience of being kidnapped by her parents and sent to Pakistan. Her familiarity grounds even the story’s most horrific details in reality.Ms. Haq builds suspense as Nisha’s attempts to escape force her to negotiate between her two cultures. In Pakistan, Nisha’s European assumptions that the streets are safer than her family home are met with dire consequences. Even when Nisha is finally able to return to Norway, she must represent both herself and her parents in meetings with child protective services because of the language barrier. Her role as a translator gives Nisha’s family an opportunity to monitor her precious opportunity for rescue.Drawing attention to the cultural differences between Nisha and her parents, Ms. Haq emphasizes the compounding pressures facing immigrant families. Nisha’s parents try to uphold the appearance of traditionalism despite their distance from home, and their anxiety at cultural loss is transferred onto their daughter (and her developing sexuality). In a resolute acknowledgment of the oppression that too many young women face at home, the film portrays the family structure as the enforcing unit of feminine docility. Here, love is another form of bondage."

Scanning the recent past, she explores how and why both the state and citizens fought this meddling, as well as the ominous forces behind it. That killer clown postcard turned out to be bankrolled by dark money, which the Republican state senator Llew Jones defines here as “advertising where you don’t know who’s paying for the ads.” He wonderingly asks: “Who’s paying for this? What are they attempting to buy?”Over 98 packed minutes, Ms. Reed answers those questions, or tries to. It’s a tricky, complicated story, one that stretches back at least to 1912, when Montana declared that corporations could not make contributions in state elections. This prohibition was challenged in 2010 when the Supreme Court ruled — in the decision known as Citizens United — that the government could not ban corporate spending in candidate elections, rendering state laws like Montana’s potentially unenforceable. Montanans had something to say about that, which is where this movie gets cooking.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018Drawing on a raft of experts, Ms. Reed explores how dark money became a political tool and why it matters. One of the documentary’s strengths is that, as it digs into local politics, it also points to the larger national stakes. As Ann M. Ravel, a former chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission puts it succinctly: “Campaign finance is like the gateway issue to every other issue that you might care about — whether it be education or tax reform or foreign policy.” Ms. Ravel also sketches in the past as she discusses the F.E.C. and her own work when she was with the California Fair Political Practices Commission.This section with Ms. Ravel, who’s an engaging presence, typifies what works and what doesn’t in “Dark Money.” Ms. Reed augments Ms. Ravel’s section with archival images (Richard M. Nixon, protesters) that don’t really clarify matters but keep the visuals jumping. Yet as faces and headlines pop on and off the screen, the chronology and the movie’s direction grow fuzzy. Ms. Ravel abruptly shows up in a California news conference announcing “that a record fine has been levied against a dark money network of political nonprofits.” Juicy stuff, even if it isn’t at all obvious yet what California has to do with Montana, never mind what year it is.Ms. Reed has taken on a vital story in “Dark Money,” which is why it’s frustrating that her storytelling isn’t better. Some introductory text or explanatory narration would have better helped historically ground viewers, who need to juggle a lot of information. When Ms. Reed introduces some time stamps, the chronology and her approach become clearer. Even so, other decisions keep things needlessly murky. Steve Bullock, for one, is identified as Montana’s attorney general for quite some time but has been its governor since 2013 and, more recently, viewed as a presidential hopeful.And so it goes in a documentary that is by turns engaging, exasperating and confusing. It’s rarely a good idea to remake a movie as you’re watching it, but it’s hard not to think that this one might have been improved by a more straightforward approach, better editing, greater critical distance and some basic information. The billionaire brothers, Charles G. and David H. Koch, for instance, are mentioned rather than actually introduced, an odd choice given that they are a major source of dark money in the United States. And while you might come away from this documentary thinking that only conservatives use dark money in politics, liberals do as well, as ProPublica and others have reported."

It belongs to the diamond merchant Lucas Hill (an earnest Keanu Reeves), who presumably got into his dangerous business to pay for stuff like his big American kitchen. Or maybe not. His motivations are as cloudy as a cheap gemstone, as he alternates between lethal skill and naïve bumbling in Matthew Ross’s leaden thriller.Lucas travels to St. Petersburg to meet his business partner, Pyotr (Boris Gulyarin), who has suddenly disappeared, leaving Lucas on his own to deal with their sadistic buyer, Boris Volkov (Pasha Lychnikoff). Boris expects a delivery of precious blue diamonds, so Lucas makes his way to Siberia in search of those jewels and Pyotr, finding instead a charming cafe owner named Katya (Ana Ularu).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 3, 2018The affair between buttoned-up Lucas and free-spirited Katya provides most of the film’s energy, in schematic contrast to Lucas’s apparently bland life at home. (Molly Ringwald plays his wife in a brief cameo appearance, the Skype equivalent of a dry peck on the cheek.) Lucas, though, is so stodgy that it’s hard to understand Katya’s instantaneous devotion to him. Yes, he might look like Keanu Reeves, but Katya goes to degrading lengths to help out someone who doesn’t seem to know exactly what he’s doing.When she asks what drew him to diamonds, he says, “I love them because they’re beautiful, and rare, and tough.” It’s a lumbering line that’s probably meant to allude to Katya as well, though as in the film itself, something crucial is missing: Lucas, risking his life and now hers, forgot to mention they’re expensive, too."

Save me some work.”With this aim in mind, I persuaded some friends to loan me their delightful 8-year-old daughter, Willow, for a press screening of “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation.” Willow is familiar with the premise of the franchise; utterly unbothered by the potentially adult-disturbing logic of building a children’s entertainment franchise around an undead vampire hero (the most famous one, Dracula, voiced once more by Adam Sandler) and his monster friends; and most tickled by the recurring character Blobby, the Jell-O-like creature who can vomit miniature versions of itself.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018This installment opens with a 19th-century flashback showing Dracula besting the vampire hunter Van Helsing: think a caped and fang-bearing Bugs Bunny versus Elmer Fudd. In present day, Dracula’s daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), arranges a cruise vacation for dad, and on board he falls for the ship’s captain Ericka (Kathryn Hahn), the granddaughter of Van Helsing and a foe who could turn friend. Both Willow and I saw this plot development several miles before its reveal.The scenes of Dracula befuddled by a mobile phone were familiar; those in which the vampire’s garlic “intolerance” preludes a flatulence joke predictable. Returning a third time as director, Genndy Tartakovsky lends his usual graphic savvy, providing a not-quite-saving grace.One of the problems with the child film reviewer model, it turns out, is the changeability of children’s opinions. During the end credits, Willow said she “loved” the movie. On the ride home, she said she “liked” most of it, but some parts were “a little scary.” Upon overhearing me tell her parents that the picture wasn’t my cup of tea, she loudly proclaimed it “the best movie ever made.”"

Powell.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018The film is not another “Spotlight,” let alone an “All the President’s Men.” The writing, by Joey Hartstone (who scripted Mr. Reiner’s “LBJ”), has more interest in reaching the least-informed viewers than in realism. (Those who deal with national affairs coverage every day don’t have so many expository conversations explaining who’s who; Milla Jovovich, as Landay’s wife, tells him that she canceled their subscription to The Times because she sees the paper’s coverage as packaged government news releases.)Still, at a time when the current president routinely dismisses the accuracy of reporting, “Shock and Awe” feels more timely than it might have. It also captures an aspect of journalism not often portrayed: the fear of being wrong when the conclusions of your reporting break from those of your competitors."

Much of “Path of Blood” makes these extremists, who sought to destabilize Saudi Arabia, look inept. Late in the movie, as cell members drive to a planned attack, one car runs low on gas.

But with a location inspired by Ireland’s infamous Magdalene laundries — where, for more than two centuries, religious orders imprisoned so-called fallen women and used them as virtual slaves — this smart but uneven horror movie has little interest in fun.Its fury, however, is all-consuming. The year is 1960 and the priest, Father Thomas (a wonderful Lalor Roddy), has been dispatched to a laundry by the Vatican to investigate reports of a statue weeping blood. He’s accompanied by a younger, wet-behind-the-ears colleague (Ciaran Flynn) who will film the investigation and whose footage reveals a diabolical stew of torture, religious depravity and satanic jiggery-pokery. The confessionals in this place must be standing room only.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018CreditCreditIFC MidnightEmploying the simplest of scares — a child’s feet whispering past the camera lens; a ghostly hand sliding from beneath a bed — the movie sometimes evokes a budget blend of “The Exorcist” and “Rosemary’s Baby.” But it’s the sincerity of the emotions that impresses. Ms. Clarke, whose family has direct experience of these laundries, uses that knowledge to inform Father Thomas’s compassionate outrage.Wielding mostly 16-millimeter film, the director of photography, Ryan Kernaghan, mimics the home movies of the time with flickering ellipses and flares of dazzling, burned-out white. Some of his images, like one of sweating young women scrubbing sheets in a haze of boiling steam, are quite beautiful. Yet despite its brief running time, the movie feels dragged out; like the priests, it will eventually lose its way."

Back in the late 1960s, it was a critic in the Paris-based magazine Cahiers du Cinéma who saw the profound subtext that American reviewers overlooked in George A. Romero’s formative “Night of the Living Dead.” And just when you thought modern portraits of the undead couldn’t become more pretentious, “The Night Eats the World,” Dominque Rocher’s tediously solemn feature debut, finds new ways to drain all the fun out of flesh-eating monsters.Its opening scene portrays Sam (Anders Danielsen Lie) falling asleep at a party, only to wake up to an empty apartment and a mob of ravenous undead on the streets below. He appears safe on this high floor. These stumbling zombies are neither fast, nor slow, but all extremely dumb. This familiar premise leads to a twist: Instead of adrenaline rush suspense scenes, this plot languishes in mundane melancholia. Mopey and alone, Sam goes about his daily tasks such as washing in rainwater and soulfully playing the drums.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 6, 2018CreditCreditBlue Fox EntertainmentThe makeup design and chase scenes are rote, and the little dramatic conflict — arguments over where to hide — traffic in the oldest clichés in the genre. What’s left is a vaguely philosophical mood, the drama class seriousness of someone who read Chekhov for the first time. When Sam stares at a grunting corpse and says: “Dead is the norm now. I’m the one who is not normal,” it’s so on the nose that you want the zombie to grab his and devour it."

(I speak from personal experience.) And rarely are they as heart-pangingly real as the girl fumbling through the sharp, smart comedy “Eighth Grade.” Like a lot of people, Kayla (the wonderful Elsie Fisher), spends a lot of time tethered to a cellphone that serves as her touchingly imperfect portal to the world. Day and deep into night, she scrolls through screen after screen of images — celebrities, cartoons, celebrity cartoons, stranger selfies — sprinkled with hashtags, online handles, candy-colored effects and emojis.A hyper-connected voyeur, Kayla seems hooked on other people’s experiences and emotions, a torrent suggesting that they, unlike her, are living their best lives and having the coolest, most awesome time. In an unplugged era, she might have just tucked into a corner with a hardcover diary, dotting her I’s with hearts as she poured out her most intimate thoughts. Instead, she watches. She also makes affirmational videos that she posts on her online channel, which is one of this movie’s shrewdest conceits. “The topic of today’s video,” she announces in one, “is being yourself,” before doling out some commendable advice: “Don’t care about what other people think about you.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018Child, heal thyself! That’s what you may find yourself thinking as “Eighth Grade” opens and Kayla slumps off to class, walking with shoulders hunched and head bowed against the chattering, exuberant student tide coming at her. It’s the last week of eighth grade, and it’s hard not to feel for the poor thing. It’s also hard not to feel exasperated by what makes Kayla so dear — her frailties, mistakes, gawkiness — as she doodles alone at lunch or buries her head in her hands after being voted “most quiet” by the other students.[Eighth graders watch “Eighth Grade,” and they can relate.]“Eighth Grade” is a simple story of an unremarkable girl, tenderly and movingly told. It was written and directed by Bo Burnham, a stand-up comic who started out by posting videos of himself on YouTube. He obviously has some ideas about the internet, which takes away so much — time, sanity, reason — but also gives. For Kayla, being online is a way of being and of becoming. That’s not necessarily understandable to grown-ups, including her single father, Mark (a note-perfect Josh Hamilton), who, with eyebrows at full alert, hovers around her with a look of barely suppressed panic bordering on terror, as if one ill-timed word or gesture could destroy life as they know it.Movies about teenagers are often filled with contrived excesses, but Mr. Burnham understands that some of the most pronounced extremes — the drama, the comedy, the horror — take place in that lonely room known as our heads. Not much happens in “Eighth Grade” except that, for Kayla, everything does and with exclamation points. When she stares at a cute boy (Luke Prael), the music thunders and the image slows, much as it did when Dudley Moore gawked at Bo Derek once upon a time. And when Kayla walks into a pool party wearing a tragic green swimsuit, she turns into the imperiled heroine of a psychodrama that briefly transforms into a psychological thriller.ImageMs. Fisher at the pool party, a squirmy tour de force for the director Bo Burnham.CreditJosh Ethan Johnson/A24The pool party is a squirmy tour de force embellished with a punctuating zoom and a plangent sense of dread that make Kayla’s isolation feel like alienation. From the way that she walks into the party — she scans the scene like a soldier heading into battle, clutching her middle as if already wounded — it’s evident that Kayla believes everyone is looking at her. What makes the scene more uncomfortable and touching is that as she wades into the suffocating surge of the cute and popular, no one even notices her. (The one attendee who does is a nerd delightfully played by Jake Ryan.) It’s a brutal scene and might have been unbearably painful if Mr. Burnham didn’t love Kayla so much.But he does (and he’s funny), a love that Ms. Fisher — only 14 when the movie was shot — complements with a performance that’s so visceral and unforced that you might find yourself transported back in time and walking again into an agonizingly similar party, thighs swishing. Part of what makes her feel so convincing is that for all her time online, Kayla looks and moves like an actual underage human being. She isn’t as smoothed and hollowed out as the smiling avatars she watches. She’s an image-obsessed 21st-century adolescent staring at a screen, but she’s also just another teenager lurching forward, one comic, hapless step at a time.It would be easy to read “Eighth Grade” as a simple cautionary tale — the following should be read in the disproving voice of adult received wisdom — about Kids These Days. Yet to do so would be to miss a crucial point about Kayla’s videos, which are at once an act of creation and self-creation. (And, by extension, are like this movie.) Kayla is lucky if she gets two views for a video, yet she continues making them, yammering into the seeming void. No matter how lousy or lonely her day, she tries to keep talking, pushing on, reaching out. She knows — or just hopes — that someone, somewhere, is paying attention, a much-tested optimism that Mr. Burnham celebrates beautifully."

And why not? All he had to do was pad it with some recycling, bank on his relationship with Mr. Johnson — they worked together on “Central Intelligence,” as mocking a title as Hollywood has produced — and Mr. Thurber had his elevator pitch: “The Towering Inferno” meets “Die Hard” but in China. Box-office domination was guaranteed as soon as the seven-figure deal was signed.There is of course a story, or at least a whisker-thin excuse for one, that finds Mr. Johnson’s character, Will, a security analyst, visiting Hong Kong on business with his surgeon wife, Sarah (Neve Campbell), and their twins. Soon after he interviews for a high-end job in the world’s tallest building — an ugly metallic behemoth that looks like a twisty trunk of an African elephant grasping a baseball — violence happens. Heavily armed thugs set fire to one floor. Will is wounded in a brutal fight and must perform self-surgery. Men in black run and plot. Sarah and the tots scramble. A chick in black with an anguished haircut mows down a roomful of anonymous computer guys.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 3, 2018Mostly, Will gets to work, or rather Mr. Johnson does, as the character undergoes the hero’s crucible of suffering with throbbing muscles, an impressive deadpan and yards of duct tape. As is always the case in male-driven fantasies like this, an ordinary man rises, just and noble and true, and transforms into a hero. As he rises, Will dodges bullets and more bullets, scales a soaring construction crane and leaps across an impossible void, a superhero without cape or portfolio. Again and again, he also dangles by a single, sweat-slicked Hitchcockian hand as all of Hong Kong anxiously watches his escapades below or on TV, oohing and ahhing in presumptive harmony with the movie’s audience.There are intermittent pleasures, including Ms. Campbell, who seems ready to transition to a new career phase playing hard-hitting maternal types with Mona Lisa smiles. Mostly, though, “Skyscraper” is about the movie’s other, far more towering figure: Mr. Johnson, a performer whose colossal physicality is strikingly complemented by a delicate expressivity too rarely seen in contemporary blockbusters. He doesn’t have to do all that much here, but as one of the last authentic monuments to he-man masculinity, he easily holds you rapt. (To see him flex more than muscles, check out the unfairly maligned fantasy film “Southland Tales” or his work on the HBO show “Ballers.”)Blockbusters like “Skyscraper” are near-indestructible entertainment delivery systems partly because they inoculate themselves against criticism with winking self-awareness — hence Will’s “stupid” line and the succession of increasingly outrageous physics-and-logic-defying stunts. Mr. Thurber ups the ante with cinematic allusions (“The Lady From Shanghai”) that feel like reviewer bait, and wouldn’t you know, I took it. Of course I did. That’s part of the contract, as is my noting that it’s welcome how race quietly figures into the story without becoming a problem that needs solving. And it is genuinely welcome even if it would have been nicer if the movie had tried harder on every other count."

Self-pitying or smug, jaunty or crestfallen, callous or contrite, the movie’s fitful tone is fully yoked to Joaquin Phoenix’s sodden-to-sober lead performance.Maybe that’s why the camera works so hard to maintain an even keel. We meet Callahan (who died in 2010) after a bender, racing to the store to refill before the D.T.s set in. He will remain precariously pickled even after a fateful night of partying in 1972 with an equally soused pal (Jack Black) leaves him quadriplegic and entirely dependent on his lackadaisical caregiver. Only when hoisting bottle to mouth becomes impossible without help does he decide it’s time to drag his sorry self up the 12 steps.ImageJack Black, left, and Joaquin Phoenix in Gus Van Sant’s “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot.”CreditScott Patrick Green/Amazon StudiosNeither embracing nor completely skirting the sinkholes of the recovery narrative — among them sanctimony, sentiment and backslapping triumphalism — Mr. Van Sant (adapting Callahan’s 1990 memoir of the same name) marshals a number of countervailing strategies. Adopting an erratic, flashback-fortified style, he disrupts the typical plod to sobriety. Offbeat casting decisions enliven Callahan’s otherwise repetitive A.A. meetings, including the reliably odd Udo Kier and marvelous turns from the musicians Beth Ditto of Gossip and Kim Gordon (formerly of Sonic Youth).The movie’s most effective antidote to piousness, though, is Callahan’s corrosive sense of humor. Sometimes scabrous and always irreverent, his cartoons swipe gleefully at disability and other sensitive topics, piercing the movie’s one-day-at-a-time orthodoxy. His hard-won, childlike drawing technique softened these provocations, yet his grim gaze could be divisive — a controversy that Mr. Van Sant glides past with little drama or detail.Which is too bad, because that surrenders a large chunk of screen time to the trudge of recovery and Callahan’s maudlin callbacks to the mother who abandoned him and whom he blames for his addiction. This wallowing can become claustrophobic; so it’s a relief to accompany Callahan as he barrels around his native Portland, Ore., in his motorized wheelchair, wiping out on street corners and goofing with a group of young skateboarders. These excursions, captured with reckless fluidity by the cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt, aerate the movie and temporarily dispel the dust of Higher Power earnestness.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018Nothing, however, can excuse the movie’s preposterous depiction of Annu (a purely decorative Rooney Mara). A stunner in a sundress (and a composite of several women in Callahan’s life), she appears before the hospitalized Callahan so drenched in angel dust she could be an illusion. The whole episode is classic inspirational mush; even later, when she transforms into a sunny flight attendant and Callahan’s layover lover, she still seems as incorporeal as his vision of his absent mother.Staggering between corny conventionality and zesty, upbeat weirdness, “Don’t Worry” never fully acknowledges the cruelty and selfishness required to sustain a longtime habit. Callahan’s Step 9 trek to make amends is accomplished with remarkable ease, and his support group is a haven of simpatico sufferers.None more so than its leader, Donnie (a revelatory Jonah Hill). A trust-fund Christian in flowing scarves and suede jackets, Donnie moves in a haze of Lao Tzu quotations and enigmatic recovery-speak, punctuated by the delicate arcs of his cigarette holder. The benevolent tugs between his chill philosophizing and Callahan’s indulgent egotism have a relaxed, buddy-movie appeal; he’s the tonic in Callahan’s gin.“Maybe life’s not supposed to be as meaningful as we think it is,” a fellow addict says during group, perhaps realizing that self-absorption can be an even tougher habit to kick than booze. Like most of us, Callahan, by movie’s end, is not quite there yet."

Creativity is a largely internal process, and most movies that succeed in capturing it do so by thinking outside the box — visually, dramatically, structurally.Simply having a famous actor grow a beard and pick up a paintbrush isn’t a recipe for a great drama. That said, next to  the recent film “Rodin,” which cast Vincent Lindon as the sculptor Auguste Rodin, “Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti,” which casts another Vincent — Cassel — as Paul Gauguin superficially has more potential for tension, given that Gauguin — who modeled and preyed sexually on underage women — is today regarded as a wildly problematic figure.But content to be yet another great-man biopic, the movie would rather sanitize than probe. The film has been adapted from Gauguin’s “Noa Noa,” the painter’s journal of his first stretch living in Tahiti, with what the director, Edouard Deluc, has acknowledged was a free hand. Some fictionalization seems fair enough, given that Gauguin’s own account has been questioned. (“If he published it today, Oprah would be demanding an apology,”  Holland Cotter wrote in The Times in 2011.)When we first meet the Gauguin of the movie, he lives in fetid surroundings in France and is eager to spend the last of his money to travel to French Polynesia. His wife (Pernille Bergendorff), confessing not to understand the undertaking, resolves to end their marriage.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJuly 2, 2018No matter. “Those who criticize me, including your family, know nothing about an artist’s nature,” Gauguin writes to her, exuding the confidence of a man who knows he’s the subject of a biopic being made more than a century later. Convinced he has the ruggedness to survive (there’s a silly scene of him trying to shoot fish with a gun), he is portrayed as a consummate artist at all times. Recovering at a hospital after a heart attack, he paints on a window.Mr. Deluc, working with the cinematographer Pierre Cottereau (and a lilting, moody score by Warren Ellis), emphasizes Tahiti’s natural light and raw scenic beauty, as Gauguin would have seen it before refracting it into bold colors and rounded edges. The movie is at its most evocative when depicting his multilingual interactions with the residents, who call him “Kokay” (their pronunciation of “Gauguin”) and propose that he marry a woman who becomes his muse (Tuhei Adams, a newcomer).But in an icky dodge, the movie does not acknowledge that the real-life bride, whom Gauguin called Tehura, was about 13 at the time of their marriage.And because showing how Tehura sparks Gauguin’s imagination isn’t quite enough to sustain a movie — in one of the bigger eureka moments, she inspires his famous 1892 painting “The Spirit of the Dead Watches” — Mr. Deluc, working with three other screenwriters, invents a love triangle of sorts, in which Gauguin suspects Tehura of having eyes for Jotepha (Pua-Tai Hikutini), a protégé of Gauguin’s.In the end, the movie reveals very little about an artist’s nature — and a lot about craven commercial calculation."

But it can also be extremely inconvenient. Love happens at a bad time for Wilson Ugabe (Cake-Baly Marcelo), the protagonist of this Hungarian film.

But he is not easily dissuaded.

The viewer may be exasperated by some of the seemingly poor decisions made by the characters. (Wilson’s stubborn masculine pride, or what seems like that, can be especially frustrating.)

A long-ago loss has slowly curdled her humanity; but the immediate focus of her ire is the neighbor’s bodaciously athletic second wife (Selma Bjornsdottir), whose suntan is being thwarted by the branches of Inga’s beautiful old tree and who wants them removed.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018CreditCreditMagnolia Pictures“At least she takes care of herself,” mumbles Inga’s husband, Baldvin (a wonderfully wry Sigurdur Sigurjonsson), squinting sidelong at his frowzy spouse before escaping to choir practice. Caught up in the feud is the couple’s disgraced son (Steinthor Hroar Steinthorsson), recently banished to his parents’ by his enraged wife over his enjoyment of a homemade sex tape. Can’t a man have a hobby?Maintaining an unrelentingly gleeful grip on the film’s tone, Mr. Sigurdsson skillfully whips absurdist comedy and chilling tragedy into a froth of surging hostilities. Neither pets nor possessions are spared as his small section of manicured suburbia, soaked in bitter enmity and pearl-gray light, begins to crumble.Over this suffocating uniformity, the tree looms like a totem of spiritual rebellion, its spreading branches as threatening to the social order as Inga’s unfettered cruelty. By the time a nail gun and chain saw make an appearance, we already know that this is a director who has no intention of wimping out."

Discussing the components of a piano, he explains how, since the industrial revolution, pianos have been made possible by imposition of civilization on nature. Machinery presses wood and strings into shape.“We humans say it falls out of tune, but that’s not exactly accurate,” Mr. Sakamoto says. When the instrument’s tuning goes awry, it means “matter is struggling to return to a natural state.”The conflict between industrial and natural elements, and Mr. Sakamoto’s embrace of both, runs throughout “Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda,” an uncommonly engaging artist portrait from Stephen Nomura Schible. The creative process is notoriously difficult to capture on camera, but by the end of this documentary, you will feel as if you not only understand Mr. Sakamoto intellectually, but also share a sense of the excitement he feels when discovering just the right match of sounds.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018Based on watching him at work, Mr. Sakamoto is more liable to approach a cymbal with a bow or a coffee mug than he is with a drumstick. He embraces computers to help with composition and, in footage we see of him as a younger man, praises their ability to play fast, difficult musical phrases. But he also strives to incorporate natural sounds into his work. We see him recording audio of melting snow in the Arctic, the way it would have sounded before human disruption.His environmental activism is presented as a function of his art. He visits the Fukushima contamination site and, as the movie opens, plays a piano that survived the 2011 Japanese tsunami damaged but intact. (“I felt as if I was playing the corpse of a piano that had drowned,” he says.) He later admits it took him time to appreciate that piano’s sound.A wry and genial subject, with a wispy crop of white hair, Mr. Sakamoto shares memories of composing music for Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor” and is shown writing the score for Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “The Revenant,” an assignment he accepted while battling throat cancer. Most behind-the-scenes documentaries have their share of dishy anecdotes — Mr. Sakamoto recalls how, on “The Sheltering Sky,” Mr. Bertolucci made him rewrite a section of the score on the fly while a 40-member orchestra waited — but part of what’s exciting about “Coda” is that it increases your appreciation for Mr. Sakamoto’s influences, too. Mr. Sakamoto is particularly passionate when analyzing the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky’s use of Bach, water, wind and footsteps in “Solaris.”It helps that Mr. Schible has enough respect for Mr. Sakamoto to let his performances play at length. (There is footage of him playing last year at the Park Avenue Armory.) The music is the thing, but it’s wonderful to hear the man as well."

Those are both present — the songs, that voice. But they’re heavy with cost. They’re warped, enlisted to indict rather than delight. The goose bumps Houston’s singing gives you in “Whitney” are the goose bumps you get anytime you hear her sing. There’s a clip of her, at 19, on “The Merv Griffin Show” doing “Home” from “The Wiz,” and the chills that come are involuntary. Here was a fever you wanted to catch.Even at this early point, the movie urges you to think about Houston as someone other than — or in addition to — one of the three or four greatest vocalists in the history of American popular music. It presents her life anew and reconsiders the very private suffering with which she might have lived it. How did someone whose nickname was Nippy, go so suddenly from angel to ghost?“Whitney” is too funereal to be a party, too sad, strange and dismaying to cheer. Yet, in its grim, guilt-inducing way, the film works, even on the occasions when it’s working against itself. What Mr. Macdonald wants to do is a kind of cultural psychobiography. The movie comprises a range of footage (famous and mostly rare) along with one-on-one interviews with her family and friends and exes and collaborators about her childhood, fame, sexuality, technical ingenuity, drug addiction, and the raising of her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, who was also an addict. Houston’s mother, the singer Cissy Houston, her ex-husband, Bobby Brown, and the music executive L. A. Reid seem self-protective in their reticence and deflection. But most participants, like her aunt and personal assistant Mary Jones, gush memories, analysis and feelings.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018Together, it all becomes a roiling drama built around Houston’s celebrity. No one person is responsible for her drug-related bathtub drowning in 2012. Guilt here is powerfully diffuse. Yet when one of Houston’s two brothers leans forward and stage-whispers something like, “This family is full of secrets,” it sounds like histrionics. But this family really was. It was rich in lies and charades, too, like Cissy and her ex-husband, John, going out in public as a couple to bolster the wholesome, whiter image they and the Arista records executive Clive Davis wanted for Houston.Some of the trouble might stem from the years the three Houston kids spent living with relatives in the Newark area while their mother was on tour. We learn that Houston’s drug use actually began as a teenager. Another of the film’s bombshells has already made it to the press, but the film itself isn’t sensational about it. A question of whether she had been sexually abused is casually raised, affirmed then unpacked by several people. And it blows open your perception of Houston as a star, mother, wife, addict and persona. It reframes her unceasingly gossiped about bond with her best friend and assistant Robyn Crawford, so that a question like “Were they lovers?” insults the salvation of the friendship.This is the second movie in two years about Houston’s demise made by a white British man. Last spring we got “Whitney: Can I Be Me?,” which the tireless gumshoe speculator Nick Broomfield directed with Rudi Dolezal. It was a Swiss Army knife of pointed fingers. That juicy, speculative sensationalism was right for the director of “Kurt & Courtney” and “Biggie and Tupac.” But even at Mr. Broomfield’s sleaziest some kind of compassion is along for the ride. Mr. Macdonald is a Scotsman who’s moved between meaty nonfiction (“One Day in September,” “Touching the Void,” “Marley”) and trashy melodrama like the Idi Amin blood bath, “The Last King of Scotland.” Their Houston documentaries complement each other in a way that establishes an unhappy genre of pop forensics — Whitney: SVU.They share some of the same players and pivotal events, like Cissy Houston and Mr. Davis’s early hold over Houston’s career and her being audibly denounced at the Soul Train Awards. (Mr. Macdonald’s film remembers Al Sharpton as a notably ruthless assailant of her racial authenticity.) Both films argue for what a primal scene the Soul Train Awards were. She was booed, she saw Mr. Brown perform, and a light bulb is said have gone off. Her humiliation as insufficiently black allegedly drew her to Mr. Brown, who, at the time, was at the height of his talent and popularity.ImageHouston taking a break during a photo session in the late 1980s or early 1990s.CreditThe Estate of Whitney E. Houston/Miramax-Roadside AttractionsCulturally, this interpretation makes sense. Maybe her apparent lack of legible blackness — of grit, stank and swagger — made a striking contrast with his abundance of it. We’ve been meant to find some kind of Faustian bargain in this — the selling of a soul for some soul. That reading of Whitney-meets-Bobby has never satisfied me. It discounts Mr. Brown’s profane sexiness and how it magnetized millions of Americans to him. (I remember wanting his phone number, too.) Maybe Houston’s attraction was opportunistic. Maybe she also got caught in a pop star’s tractor beam. It also disserves how hard it must have been for Mr. Brown to resist Houston, at least the spontaneous, cutting, charismatic version of her these two movies present. Houston was responding to something about this man, and what if it was more than a Boston adolescence spent in public housing?Mr. Macdonald can see Houston as being greater than her victimhood. Or maybe it’s that he sees her victimhood as being a tragedy greater than any single culprit. The opening minutes come from the set of the “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” video, the most buoyant (and blond) five minutes Houston ever had in the MTV era. But the first thing you hear is Houston recounting a recurring dream in which she runs from the Devil and is never caught. (Later we hear her tell Diane Sawyer, in a flabbergastingly intimate interview, that she’s her biggest devil.)While she ruminates, chaos keeps interrupting the images from the video until it rips the buoyancy apart. And what comes bulldozing through is riot footage that’s meant to connect Houston to her upbringing in Newark. You see something like that, and you groan. It’s a cinematic flourish that suggests a director who doesn’t trust his material.But Mr. Macdonald doesn’t let up. He uses a montage to boil down her explosion into superstardom scored only, at first, to the vocal track of “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” So you get the Billboard chart zoom-ins put in a blender with bad-metaphor shots of a rocket launch and footage of the Statue of Liberty, a Coca-Cola commercial and, randomly, Michael Jackson in his “Bad” video. He pulls this move once or twice more (tossing in Bill Clinton, O.J. Simpson, the Oklahoma City bombing, Princess Diana’s death, the L.A. Riots), and we’re meant to think of this woman’s turmoil as matching half of the planet’s. But if it feels like too much, it probably should. Here’s an argument for Houston as this tabloid-addled natural resource that we guzzled like soda.Really, though, you don’t even have to look that far out. Simply probing Houston’s ache gives “Whitney” its hefty woe. Toward the end of the film, he takes us back to her doing “Home” that day on “Merv Griffin.” Seeing it again, after absorbing the biographical shocks, deepens the movie and its subject. Now, you not only hear longing but pain. Whitney from Newark becomes the inverse of Dorothy from Kansas — or, in “The Wiz,” Dorothy from Harlem. Maybe the wicked witches and phony wizards made home seem like such a terrible place that she might actually have felt safer in Oz."

As he brushes the dirt off his mother’s gravestone, Moss (Mitchell Slaggert) explains that his birth came at the cost of her life. Today he turns 18, an event that brings his filial guilt to the surface.Rather than offering congratulations or solace, his father (Billy Ray Suggs) orders Moss to deliver his grandmother’s medicine. But for his first act of grown-up freedom, Moss ignores his family. Instead he wanders into the swampy wilderness of his hometown to meet women and smoke weed with his best friend, Blaze (Dorian Cobb.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018Though the plot is built around the drama of Moss’s family, no person in this film is as clearly detailed as the place they call home. The director, Daniel Peddle, captures the culture of rural North Carolina through small observations of texture and atmosphere.In his meandering tour of the territory, Moss meets and becomes infatuated with Mary (Christine Marzano), an itinerant traveler who teaches him how to make an apple bong after they spend an afternoon gutting fish. They watch from a distance as Moss’s father picks up driftwood along the beach, mining waste that he will eventually transform into the found object sculptures that carry his grief.With its gently twanging score, “Moss” is a film made in a minor key and its pleasures are minor, too. It passes like a lazy afternoon spent gently high. There’s not much this movie wants to accomplish, but it maintains a mood that sets the mind at ease."

So he probably would have found “A Skin So Soft” — Denis Côté’s surreal study of six dedicated musclemen — as depressing as I did.Both works in progress and obsessively maintained machines, the bodies displayed here seem as inhospitable to play as to love handles. Oiled and pumped, exfoliated and massaged in preparation for upcoming competitions, these sculpted specimens focus fanatically on self-care. Their narcissism is repellent yet riveting, and Mr. Côté comes at his subjects with an artful, exploratory obliqueness that’s endearingly curious, as if discovering a whole new species.It’s a species that rarely speaks — “You haven’t spoken to me in two days,” a woman complains to her hulking partner — or socializes. Solitary, meticulously measured meals are consumed, one man grimacing as he forces a Kibbles-like mush down his throat.

Yet his long shots of the men, motionless and alone, express a melancholy and isolation that’s oddly touching. There’s no apparent joy in these painful exertions, and the occasional signs of a wider life — practicing kinesiology, getting lost inside a virtual-reality headset — fail to banish the movie’s disconsolate monotony. Even a neatly arranged shoe closet looks heartbreaking.Mr. Côté, though, knows what he’s doing, deliberately calling attention to the defenselessness and uncertainty beneath the men’s apparent invincibility.“Don’t forget your thighs,” one woman commands from a lawn chair as her partner poses experimentally on a makeshift backyard stage.

It begins in 2013 as he is unspooling big plans: “We’ve just opened Pakta, a Peruvian Japanese, and a vermouth bar. In January we’ll open the Mexican … I see it like a film director making five genre films.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 29, 2018In Mr. Adrià’s kitchens, we see the standard features of high-end postmodern cuisine: foam, zest, oil, small butane torches. Chefs speak of food using words like “language” and “discourse.” Conventional notions of customer satisfaction are rarely broached. The ethos seems to be, let conceptual imagination and meticulous preparation rule, and a memorable dining experience is bound to follow. But the film also shows how these meals are built from the ground up, and with backbreaking work. It also addresses, albeit not with too much specificity, the economic anxieties of creating these businesses.Mr. Adrià rarely loses his temper even as he faces steep challenges on the path to opening his magnum opus, Enigma. He shows a sharp tongue at times, upbraiding a chef with, “You have the capacity to deform and destroy everything.” Sibling rivalry is a consistent subtext but only that — Mr. Adrià’s main concern is to create. As it happens, in this generally likable film he is at his most endearing when fixing himself a simple (but indeed delicious looking) grilled ham and cheese sandwich."

At 64, Mr. Chan is still the most talented and witty athlete in cinema.

(For reasons too complicated, and dumb, to get into, Nancy doesn’t know Mr. Chan’s character is her dad.) The villain, André, is a failed experiment in this line. This renders the fellow — who’s made up to look like a minor Sith Lord, or the mascot for a Goth-metal band — very hard to kill.

In its world of over-muscled giant slayers, the wee superhero Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has proved an anomaly because, even when he expands from ant-size to giant, he remains a regular guy, one of life’s little people. That’s still very much the case in “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” an engaging goof that resists bludgeoning you with bigness and instead settles for good vibes and jokes. Look! Up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! [Squints.] It’s a surprisingly enjoyable summer romp!Known as Scott Lang when he’s off duty, Ant-Man got off to a shaky start, particularly when compared with Marvel’s current constellation of cinematic heroes. As laid out in “Ant-Man,” his grindingly dull first stand-alone movie, he’s an electrical engineer turned thief turned superhero who doesn’t have a mythology, natural powers or a dramatic origin story that can be repeatedly retold ad infinitum. (Although given Marvel’s reliance on recycling, it might well be.) Mostly, Ant-Man has a cool suit that enables him to downsize while having superhuman strength and allows him to communicate with insects that do his bidding. Sometimes, he hitches a ride on the back of a flying ant. It’s a living.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018CreditCreditBen Rothstein/Marvel-DisneyThis time it’s also fast, bright and breezy, having already dispensed with the back-story particulars. These were largely forgettable and involved Scott’s stealing the Ant-Man suit from its original owner, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas, back again, goateed and amused), one of those genius scientists who stir up good and bad trouble in Marvel world. Dr. Pym has a convoluted history and a missing wife, Janet van Dyne (the reliable M.V.P. Michelle Pfeiffer), who factors into the story along with their daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, finding her groove). Hope in turn has a much-improved haircut and, as the title announces, a much-expanded role as the Wasp, Ant-Man’s kicky partner.The sequel has the same director, Peyton Reed, although it might as well have a new one. (The screenwriters are Mr. Rudd, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari.) Like everyone else who has returned for duty, Mr. Reed seems vastly happier to be here than he did last time around, perhaps because he is no longer burdened with having to introduce a Marvel movie brand or has managed to loosen the corporate yoke. Whatever got his juices flowing, Mr. Reed, a comedy veteran (“Bring It On”), handles the new, fairly unencumbered material with a generally light touch, so that for once a Marvel movie feels shorter than its running time (in this case 118 minutes).That lightness extends through “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” affecting not just what the characters say and do but how they interact. In too many superhero movies and especially sequels, characters don’t as much talk to one another as advance the story in between big blocks of action. One kablooey leads to another, and every so often, as if to remind us of the pretty faces that go with the suits, the superheroes huddle. They plot and they quip and then it’s just bang, boom, repeat. The assumption seems to be that because the audience knows the franchise there’s no need to incorporate anything meaningful — anything like life — that might distinguish or deepen its characters.ImageEvangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym.CreditBen Rothstein/Marvel-DisneyPartly because Ant-Man is such a modest champion, particularly by blockbuster standards, he needs a personality and not simply powers to sustain interest, especially for a sequel. The filmmakers smartly give Mr. Rudd enough to work with: Scott has friends, worries, a pulse. He also has an equal and romantic sparring partner in Hope, and a kid who doesn’t make your teeth hurt (Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie). Mr. Rudd could have coasted on his cutie-pie smile and natural appeal, but he fills in the character winningly, imbuing Scott with an easygoing looseness — and a deadpan that teasingly teeters between innocence and stupidity — that keeps his heroics grounded and human.It’s funny how little things, like personality, can lift a movie. “Ant-Man and the Wasp” features kinetic action sequences, but what makes it zing is that Mr. Reed has figured out how to sustain the movie’s intimacy and its playfulness, even when bodies and cars go flying. He wants (needs) to wow you with special effects. But he seems even more committed to the absurdity of Ant-Man this time around, to the dread and laughter that accompany this eminently squishable superhero. Mr. Reed persuasively embraces the story’s Alice in Wonderland weirdness and also makes it a seamless piece with the action sequences, as in one witty kitchen fight that would make Claes Oldenburg giggle.As with many movies of this type, the story is the least of it. There are villains, a few lines of action, the usual cliffhangers, some getaways and dashes of family melodrama. There’s an office building that Dr. Pym shrinks to suitcase size and rolls away, and a car chase through the streets of San Francisco that, disappointingly, does not involve Mr. Douglas, a star of the 1970s TV series “The Streets of San Francisco.” There is also a cavalcade of seasoned second-bananas and scene-stealers — Michael Peña, Randall Park, Walton Goggins, Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale, among others — who with talent and timing help keep the buzz going as Mr. Rudd and Ms. Lilly go gently, amusingly buggy."

Juxtaposing a clinical control bunker, where mainly white operatives observe the gory action, with a neighborhood church where overwhelmingly black and Latino residents huddle in fear, the movie insists that the sidelines are not an option. In the end, even Skeletor will learn where his true loyalties lie."

(The movie credits two directors in different capacities: Akiyuki Shinbo as chief director and Nobuyuki Takeuchi as director.) Though the premise is taken from a live-action television film, the story seems well suited to the free-form possibilities of animation. The unrealized potential makes the rote line style and stagnant backdrops seem all the blander.The plot is as old as junior high school: Two schoolboy friends, Norimichi (Masaki Suda) and Yusuke (Mamoru Miyano), have a crush on the same girl, Nazuna (Suzu Hirose). She asks Yusuke on a date but ends up spending time with Norimichi when Yusuke stands her up.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018The pair’s time together is disrupted, though, and could never last long, anyway: Nazuna is about to move away. But at the beach, she has found a magic orb (described in the subtitled version as a ball, though it looks like a marble at first). Norimichi discovers that if he throws it and makes a wish, he can turn back time to earlier in the day to relive events with improved outcomes.But “Fireworks” doesn’t turn into “Groundhog Day.” After a few second chances, the couple begin to appreciate the time they have and perhaps recognize the importance of perspective in defining how we see the world. (In a subplot, the schoolboys argue over the basic shape of fireworks.) Both morals are too trite to qualify as revelations."

Sales reps are supposed to start with “Sorry to Bother You,” which is the title of Boots Riley’s movie about Cassius’s rise, fall and bizarre sideways bounces. Mr. Riley is not sorry at all. If you’re not bothered — also tickled, irked, mystified and provoked — then you’ve fallen asleep on the job.It’s fair to say that “Sorry to Bother You” sticks to its own script, but crucial to add that the script in question flips, swerves, meanders and all but explodes in a flurry of ideas and inspirations. If Mike Judge’s “Office Space” and Robert Downey Sr.’s “Putney Swope” hooked up after a night of bingeing on hallucinogens, Marxist theory and the novels of Paul Beatty and Colson Whitehead, the offspring might look something like this.If you wanted to propose an alternative genealogy — an episode of “The Twilight Zone” directed by Melvin Van Peebles and Ken Loach; a blaxploitation Polish sci-fi allegory from the ’70s; a puppet show produced by Kendrick Lamar and Charlie Kaufman — I wouldn’t be mad. Mr. Riley, an artist, activist and musician making his feature-directing debut, is both an omnivore and an original. One of the secondary pleasures of watching “Sorry to Bother You” is sifting through its possible influences. But Mr. Riley isn’t constructing yet another postmodern playhouse out of borrowings and allusions. He’s building a raft, and steering it straight into the foaming rapids of racism, economic injustice and cultural conflict.ImageLakeith Stanfield sticks to the script as a telemarketer in Boots Riley’s “Sorry to Bother You.”CreditPeter Prato/Annapurna PicturesThe film opens on a note of impish farce, as Cassius (Lakeith Stanfield) shows up for an interview with a counterfeit trophy and a phony employee-of-the-month plaque. He settles into his cubicle with a copy of that must-be-stuck-to script and a list of names and numbers. Mr. Riley adds a touch of loopy surrealism when Cassius pops into the homes of his marks, and drops hints of dystopian satire in the form of advertisements for a company called Worry Free.Worry Free, founded by Steve Lift, a Silicon Valley libertarian tech-bro visionary dirtbag (played by Armie Hammer, perhaps too perfectly for his own good), offers desperate people guaranteed food and shelter in exchange for lifetime servitude. This system of contractual slavery, which combines mass incarceration with the old plantation regime in a context of free consumer choice, doesn’t much worry Cassius, whose upward mobility accelerates at his new job. His existence may be precarious — he lives in his uncle’s garage and is behind on the rent — but at least he can work alongside his best friend, Salvador (Jermaine Fowler). And Cassius’s girlfriend, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), an artist with a day job twirling signs in front of businesses, is happy that he’s gainfully employed.Things keep getting better, and also more complicated. A union drive at the telemarketing firm coincides with Cassius’s rise through the ranks. He is transferred from the basement boiler room to the airy upper-floor suites where the big shots make their calls. He is taken under the wing of one such big shot (Omari Hardwick), who introduces Cassius to Steve Lift himself. It’s not all bread and roses, though. Lift makes Cassius a little uncomfortable, and a labor organizer (Steven Yeun) seems to be making a move on Detroit.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 26, 2018But she and Cassius have left the garage for a sunny, uncluttered apartment, and all in all the terms of his Faustian bargain look pretty attractive, like an upscale version of the Worry Free deal. Why even have a soul if it can’t be monetized?Did Cassius have one to begin with? His inmost self can be hard to discern. Mr. Stanfield, who has shown himself to be an intriguing actor in “Crown Heights,” “Get Out” and the FX series “Atlanta,” can seem quiet to the point of passivity. But his diffidence goes hand in hand with sensitivity, hyper-alertness and a scorpion-tailed wit. Cassius is by turns cautious and audacious, unflappable and panicky, easily freaked out and able to deal with the craziest of situations.And the situations get pretty crazy. There may not be method to Mr. Riley’s madness, but there is a measure of coherence, of intellectual discipline, to his wildness. What Cassius wants is what everyone wants: success, security, solidarity, sex. But the movie’s imaginary world forces him to make choices that seem unfair if not impossible — between political commitment and personal ambition, between love and power, between staying true to his friends and becoming a sellout. Which makes it a lot like the real world.ImageArmie Hammer plays a Silicon Valley tech-bro in “Sorry to Bother You.”CreditPeter Prato/Annapurna PicturesWhich is how satire works, of course. And like other works of contemporary satire, “Sorry to Bother You” sometimes has a strenuously chaotic, all-over-the-place feeling. Mr. Riley misses a few easy targets, and occasionally shows off his skill at shooting oversize fish in tiny barrels. He is after big game, though — race and class, labor and capital, art and technology — and his aim, while eccentric, is very often true.I hesitate to unpack too much from his grab bag of gags and conceits. His take on the code-switching that is part of how African-Americans function in white-dominated social spaces involves giving certain characters access to a “white voice.” Sometimes when Mr. Stanfield and Mr. Hardwick open their mouths we hear David Cross and Patton Oswalt. Conceptually the joke might not be all that fresh, but the execution is weird enough to make it pretty hilarious.A later development is so outlandish that it sets the movie wobbling on the edge of willful silliness. Unless, that is, it resets the premise and raises the stakes, turning a playful, barbed riff on identity politics and political economy into a nightmarish vision of impending human extinction.Or — you see how the possibilities multiply, how the potential arguments swarm and swirl — a vision of revolution. Mr. Riley’s futurism is not merely speculative or playful, and while “Sorry to Bother You” is too nimble to be polemical, it is insistently political. Cassius and his peers belong very much to the present. Like many young people, they drift into adulthood in search of pleasure and meaning, money and sex, navigating their own anxieties and a radically inhumane but somehow also tolerable social order. It’s fun to hang out with them, but you can’t help but be bothered by what might be coming next. Not only in the movie."

It is a blissful, serene scene, one set to the sounds of human movement and the familiar natural buzzing, chirping and whirring. The tall mossy trees and carpet of ferns suggest that it’s the Pacific Northwest, somewhere deep in the woods. Father and daughter seem to be camping — there are tarps as well as a fire pit, though no car or other people in sight — but then the girl sits on a plastic milk crate and the two settle into the site they call home.The director Debra Granik has a gift for cinematic spaces that are vibrantly, palpably alive, and for putting you in places, whether modest homes or the great outdoors, that make you feel as if you’re standing right alongside her characters. In “Leave No Trace,” she immediately sets you down in a forest that’s so inviting, so tranquil, that it seems like utopia and all the possibilities that wistful, elusive ideal implies. Look, she seems to say as the camera pulls up and away — and cuts the two human travelers down to humble size — look at all this grandeur, all this unspoiled beauty. Don’t you want in?ImageBen Foster and Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie play father and daughter in “Leave No Trace,” the new movie from Debra Granik, the director of “Winter’s Bone.”CreditScott Green/Bleecker StreetThe title evokes the ethos embraced by experienced campers and others who know the true way to love nature is to do no harm. (Pack it in, pack it out.) In “Leave No Trace,” the words also come to mean something more disturbing and difficult, namely the desire and sometimes the need to be so far apart from civilization that you’re profoundly, perhaps permanently outside it. When the movie opens, the young teenage girl, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), and her father, Will (Ben Foster), aren’t just living — foraging, surviving, apparently thriving — in the forest, they are existing in a state of willed invisibility.In “Leave No Trace,” Ms. Granik explores what it means to be so far on the margins you might as well not exist at all, at least as far as the larger world is concerned. It’s a familiar concern for Ms. Granik, who’s drawn to American outsiders — intentional and unintentional exiles alike — living in what are often blandly called poor and marginalized communities. These are the people who populate her stories and bring them to tangibly real life in dramatic movies like “Winter’s Bone,” set in the Ozark Mountains in rural Missouri, and in her documentary “Stray Dog,” which centers on a gruffly warm biker and Vietnam veteran who radically defies stereotype.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018Shortly after the movie begins, a swarm of police and social-service types crashes Tom and Will’s makeshift sanctuary, destroying it. After a brief interrogation, father and daughter are relocated to a modest house adjacent to a tree farm. There, under supervision — the main caseworker is a kindly, stubborn meddler — Will works for the owner helping harvest trees while Tom, her curiosity blossoming as her world expands, explores their new home. She learns how to ride a bike, a donation that Will initially refuses, and meets a boy (Isaiah Stone). He’s building a tiny house (self-reliance is one of the movie’s refrains) and introduces her to 4-H (community is another).Based on the novel “My Abandonment,” by Peter Rock, “Leave No Trace” opens up gradually, much like Tom does. Written by Ms. Granik and Anne Rosellini, it follows a fairly straight narrative line that occasionally heads down seeming detours that subtly enrich its realism. When Will and Tom visit a Veterans Affairs facility in an early scene, Ms. Granik visually underscores the building’s chilly institutionalism yet also reminds you of the people inside it. Because when Tom speaks to one man, the point isn’t so much their talk but all the veterans around them who — having once served with others — seem to now wait and roam, on foot and in wheelchairs, in pronounced isolation.ImageDale Dickey with Ms. Harcourt McKenzie.CreditScott Green/Bleecker StreetThroughout, Ms. Granik brings you into worlds within worlds and puts her loners in sight of communities, creating a dynamic that pushes the story forward and pulls at Tom and Will. Other people continually tug at this insistently quiet, intimate movie (you hear birds and human breath alike), unsettling the seclusion that Will, freely or by necessity, has escaped into with Tom. And while his name sounds meaningful, it isn’t easily decoded. Ms. Granik is interested in free will or its illusion — a grimy Palestinian scarf Will wears points to military time served in the Middle East and the haunted history he continues to carry with him — but she’s also asking what we owe to other people.“Leave No Trace” is only Ms. Granik’s third fiction feature, and she is still finding ways to create and sustain narrative tension without the kind of genre beats that helped give “Winter’s Bone” its forward thrust. (Her feel for down-home alienation and the charisma of that movie’s breakout star, Jennifer Lawrence, did their part.) Here, Ms. Granik instead employs a restraint that worked so well in her documentary “Stray Dog.” She looks hard and by looking encourages us to see the beauty — and meaning — in the everyday: the velvety moss on a tree, the opalescent shimmer of a spider web and the tenderness that envelops Will and Tom, sustaining them and a story that occasionally drifts.In its best moments, “Leave No Trace” invites you to simply be with its characters, to see and experience the world as they do. Empathy, the movie reminds you, is something that is too little asked of you either in life or in art. Both Mr. Foster’s and Ms. Harcourt McKenzie’s sensitive, tightly checked performances are critical in this regard; he holds you close to Will by keeping the character boarded up even as she draws you to Tom with anxious discretion and a heartbreaking vocal tremulousness that sometimes speaks louder than words. Neither actor begs for your heart, but each — like this movie — takes it."

For better and for worse, their parenting style matches their prickly relationship. Flighty Erasmus plans parties to help Bill make friends, while duty-bound Paul takes over mundane tasks like packing lunches and driving the boy to his Santa Fe elementary school.The director of “Ideal Home,” Andrew Fleming, based the movie on his own experience as the second parent to his partner’s child, and the movie thrives by depicting the idiosyncratic textures of gay relationships. “Ideal Home” is genuinely funny, and the poignant and pithy script is aided by the chemistry between its stars, who are equally adept with comedic punch lines as they are with dramatic gut punches. Refreshingly, the film’s tone seems pitched more to gay audiences than straight ones. Erasmus and Paul would prefer white wine over beer, thank you, and there is a pleasing and rare lack of self-consciousness about the way the characters engage with their identities.“Ideal Home” avoids explicitly addressing its politics until the credits, which play over a photo montage of real gay families. Mr. Fleming’s gesture is clearly heartfelt, but in a film that avoids the sappiness so frequently reserved for gay domesticity in popular entertainment, it is the one sentimental sleight of hand that gives the game away."

Yet even in the swelling canon of British rural miserabilism, this unrelentingly intense psychodrama burrows beneath the skin.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018CreditCreditFilmRiseMuch of that is due to Ruth Wilson’s tough, traumatized performance as Alice, an itinerant sheep shearer who returns home to claim tenancy of the family farm. Fifteen years have passed, and her estranged brother, Joe (a fine Mark Stanley), who nursed their terminally ill father while the farm crumbled around them, is not having it. He might be a bitter drunk — and the farm, under his stewardship, a vermin-infested husk of the smallholding Alice remembers — but he feels equally owed his inheritance. And, unlike Alice, entirely unable to share it.Gorgeously photographed by the Brazilian cinematographer Adriano Goldman, “Dark River” is a raw ballad of doom and damage. As in Ms. Barnard’s first feature, the 2011 experimental documentary “The Arbor,” it broodingly excavates the lingering grip of childhood abuse. Economic anxieties press in from outside, but it’s the farm’s fusty interiors, where every cranny conceals a flinching flashback, that spark Alice’s worst memories. As the ghost of her father (indelibly played by Sean Bean) slips in and out of the frame, she turns from steely survivor to terrified child. It almost hurts to look at her.Woven through with a musical version of the traditional children’s rhyme “An Acre of Land” (sung with haunting clarity by PJ Harvey), “Dark River” fumbles the ending, but its pain echoes far beyond the decaying rooms where it was born."

Once a month or so, Oren arrives in Berlin for business — and a generous slice of Black Forest gâteau — leaving a wife, Anat (Sarah Adler), and young son back in Jerusalem.When Oren dies suddenly between visits, Thomas, obeying some primal instinct and with no clear purpose, immediately travels to Jerusalem. Concealing his identity, he takes a part-time job in the small cafe run by Oren’s weary young widow, so impressing her and her customers with his piping skills that he soon becomes a fixture.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018This doesn’t sit well with Moti (Zohar Strauss), Anat’s Orthodox brother-in-law, whose disapproval of the lonely gentile in their midst subtly pokes at historical animus. Yet social and religious undercurrents remain mostly muted; and while Moti might be worried about the newcomer’s effect on the cafe’s kosher certification, he’s also kind enough to ensure that Thomas doesn’t eat Shabbat supper alone.Relying on warm intuition over cold logic, “The Cakemaker” can at times seem almost detached from reality, its characters mere symbols in a delicate fable about the fluidity of attachment and the permeability of boundaries. Thomas’s gentle diffidence, and his director’s fiercely rigorous style, leave his motives denser than unproved sourdough. With no back story or visible friends or family, he’s a smooth-skinned enigma whose soft, cushiony physicality anchors the movie’s tactile preoccupations. Is he seeking a companion in sorrow or an immersion in a life that was always kept hidden? He isn’t saying, but his kind eyes and busily kneading hands are somehow eloquence enough.Sad and sweet, and with a rare lyricism, “The Cakemaker” believes in a love that neither nationality, sexual orientation nor religious belief can deter. Some may find its reticence off-putting or even irritating, but at heart it’s just a tender love triangle with a ghost in the middle. And a mouthwatering abundance of crème fraîche."

The documentary, “Love, Cecil,” directed with energy and affection by Lisa Immordino Vreeland, doesn’t grapple with that question, and doesn’t have to; almost 40 years after Beaton’s 1980 death at age 76, no aesthete has come close to duplicating his output or his impact.Narrated by Rupert Everett and enlivened by vivid swatches of Beaton’s own prose, “Love, Cecil,” after beginning with archival footage of a late-in-life television interview with the man, hews to a relatively straightforward linear chronology.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018Born into an upper-middle-class but not quite upper-crust family in turn-of-the-century England, the young Beaton was introduced to high society by his friend Stephen Tennant. Beaton initially made his name photographing the “bright young things” of 1920s London, the more refined precursors of what we now call “club kids.”A subsequent alliance with the publisher Condé Nast opened the door to fashion and celebrity photography. Beaton had to leave Vogue for a spell after inserting a piece of anti-Semitic graffito in one of his drawings. While he apologized profusely and sincerely, the movie never pins down what he was thinking when he did that.Not that it matters much. The quirks of Beaton’s personality — his cultivation of enemies and frustrated romanticism, among them — are finally not as interesting as his work.

Albeit one that gets no more physical than a desperate cuddle.Intent on painting the portrait of the Lakota Sioux chief Sitting Bull (Michael Greyeyes), Catherine (Jessica Chastain) travels from New York City to North Dakota. Merrily widowed and wealthy enough to roam with relative impunity, she’s unprepared for the complex politics of the region, managing to irritate the tribespeople, the United States Army (in the brusque form of a stellar Sam Rockwell) and the brutally bigoted townsfolk. A treaty is being negotiated (the never-mentioned Dawes Act of 1887), and tensions are running high.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018CreditCreditRichard Foreman/A24As Catherine unwisely decides to mix painting and politicizing and gin up opposition to the treaty, her stays loosen and her hair escapes its elaborate pins and tucks. Sitting Bull, for his part — little more than a dejected potato-planter before she shows up, according to Steven Knight’s vague, unfocused script — needs only a pep talk from Catherine to put the light of resistance back in his eyes and the feathers back in his headdress.It’s all ridiculously romanticized and self-serving. But the performances are so good (Mr. Greyeyes, in particular, is a miracle of intelligence and dignity) and Michael Eley’s vistas, shimmeringly shot in New Mexico, are so stunning, it feels churlish to resist. A single image of distant hilltops, white-capped to suggest the bleached bones of long-gone buffalo, evokes the tragedy of the West more powerfully than any page of impassioned dialogue."

Pepsi is also a producer of this feature, which helps account for its character.The story line involves the hapless amateur coach Dax (Lil Rel Howery), who has his team usurped by a childhood rival (Nick Kroll, laying on a lot of “in your face” schtick that’s more annoying than he might have intended). He’s told to find the aged court legend “Uncle Drew,” here fleshed out to feel like a homage to the real-life street-ball legend Earl Manigault. Mr. Irving’s crusty codger insists on filling the roster with back-in-the-day teammates played by Mr. O’Neal, Reggie Miller, Chris Webber and Nate Robinson.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018The old-age makeup applied to these performers is — and I suppose this was entirely deliberate — unrealistic. The outlandish hairpieces and facial prosthetics produce an effect somewhere between TV sketch comedy and Kabuki theater. As conventionally unconvincing as the enterprise has to be, the movie tries to tug at the heartstrings with its suggestion that in these old men Dax has found a new family.At the same time, possibly because of the soft-drink-company sponsorship, “Uncle Drew” has a bland undertaste. The comic dynamo Tiffany Haddish, as Dax’s mercenary ex-girlfriend, seems tame here. Through it all, though, Mr. O’Neal, playing a martial-arts instructor harboring an old grudge against the title character, quietly but steadily builds the most complete characterization in the movie. It turns out, he’s learned an acting trick or two since the ghastly “Kazaam.”"

There is nothing supernatural, nothing especially out of the ordinary, about the force that terrorizes Miriam Besson (Léa Drucker) and her children. It’s Miriam’s ex-husband, Antoine (Denis Ménochet), a man who wears his everydayness like a badge of righteousness. In his own mind, Antoine is a simple fellow with reasonable expectations, whose rage when they aren’t met is surely justified. To everyone else — Miriam, her parents, his children, the audience — he is a ticking bomb, a train hurtling down the track from battery to homicide.Mr. Legrand is skilled in the techniques of dread and suspense, and without sensationalizing or cheapening the story, he gives this closely observed drama the tension and urgency of a thriller. Or, to put it another way, he uses thriller tactics — a ruthlessly objective camera, editing rhythms that ratchet up the anxiety of quiet moments, disciplined performances — in the service of documentary ends.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018“Custody” begins with a scene that could be an excerpt from a Frederick Wiseman film (“Domestic Violence” most obviously). A magistrate and her assistant sit down with Miriam, Antoine and their lawyers. The mood is patient and deliberative. Everyone has a chance to speak, as the judge listens intently and asks skeptical questions. Emotion cedes the floor to reason.Antoine, who is the only man in the room, wants to see his kids, or at least his son, Julien (Thomas Gioria). Neither Julien nor his sister, Joséphine (Mathilde Auneveux), wants anything to do with him, but only Josephine is old enough for her wishes to be respected by the state. Julien, who is 11, is in effect sentenced in absentia to spend alternate weekends with his father, a person whose name he has whited out of his school forms and whom he refers to in depositions as “l’autre.” (The subtitles render it as “that man”; the literal meaning is “the other.”)Antoine’s history of violence against his family — Miriam in particular — is alluded to in the hearing. (It is also the subject of Mr. Legrand’s powerful Oscar-nominated short, “Just Before Losing Everything,” which observes Miriam’s desperate flight from her abuser.) There is nothing ambiguous about the situation, but since Miriam never pressed charges and Antoine is an otherwise upstanding fellow, the state in its wisdom decides that compromise is the fairest way forward.The consequences of this decision are horrifying, but hardly surprising. Mr. Legrand’s realism is more procedural than psychological. We don’t know a lot about Miriam, who used to work in a big-box retail store, or Antoine, who is in charge of fire safety at a hospital, beyond their day-to-day actions. Their marriage is far in the background, as is anything that might impair the precision of what amounts to a thorough and rigorous diagramming of the loci of abuse.ImageThomas Gioria portrays an 11-year-old who wants nothing to do with his father.CreditKino LorberIt is just possible to imagine that the burly, brooding Antoine was once a kind husband and an attentive father. But whatever tenderness might have been inside him was long ago swallowed up by possessiveness, self-pity and paranoia. The love he professes for his family expresses itself as a furious desire for control and a petulant sense of grievance when his will is thwarted. He manipulates Julien to get to Miriam, tormenting the boy with promises that turn suddenly into threats. With Miriam, Antoine can be coldly rational, weepy and needy, or quietly intimidating. When he is with her, the possibility of violence hovers in the air like an odorless, highly flammable gas.Nobody knows what the explosion will look like, but Antoine is certain of one thing: It will not be his fault. The truest and worst thing about him is his ironclad sense of victimhood. When he hurts or terrifies Miriam, Julien or Joséphine (or when he erupts at his own father), it is because they made him do it. Their desire to be free of him is the greatest provocation of all, one that warrants a campaign of stalking, harassment and worse.“Custody” never lifts its eyes beyond the particulars of this family, which becomes as vivid and real to us as our own neighbors and friends. But Mr. Legrand knows that no family is an island. The Bessons are citizens, students and workers, enmeshed in networks of solidarity that offer at least a partial, fragile promise of protection.This film’s absolutely convincing depiction of intimate abuse is less a case study than a political theory. Antoine responds to a perceived loss of dominance with limitless resentment and a hypersensitivity to the slightest sign of disrespect or incivility. The objects of his wrath need to be nice to him, or else. He doesn’t only frighten Miriam, Julien and Joséphine. He forces them to live on his terms, in anticipation of his moods and whims and in fear of his inevitable disappointment or displeasure. You can call this toxic masculinity, pathological narcissism or the ugly face of patriarchy. You may also recognize it as a currently fashionable principle of governance."

So, tread (and read) lightly! Engrossing, and sometimes enraging, the movie tells of triplets who, after being adopted separately at birth, were reunited by happenstance. None of the men — or their families — knew about the others, which naturally led to questions and has inspired the director Tim Wardle to turn their mysterious history into a detective story in reverse, one that begins with the seeming denouement (the happy reunion) and then moves back and forth across time.Image“They talk the same, they laugh the same, they hold their cigarettes the same — it’s uncanny,” one of their mothers said in a 1980 article in The New York Times.CreditNeonOlder viewers may find themselves nodding along, remembering the triplets story as fragments emerge. In 1980, Robert Shafran, 19 at the time, arrived at Sullivan County Community College in New York for his freshman year and was surprised that everyone was so warmly welcoming. Students smilingly greeted him, clapping him on the back. Some girls kissed him, he remembers, and everyone called him Eddy. Mr. Shafran was in his dorm room when another student, Michael Domnitz, excitedly told him that he must be a twin. There was a hasty phone call, a long drive into the night and an emotional reunion with Eddy Galland, Mr. Domnitz’s friend and Mr. Shafran’s unsettling double.Mr. Wardle brings you into this grabber of a story effortlessly with a lively, nimble mix of archival imagery, contemporary interviews and some unnecessary fictional re-creations. The story he tells grows exponentially more complicated with the emergence of another look-alike, David Kellman, and — just like that, these newly acquainted twins are now triplets. In a 1980 article in The New York Times about the men, one of their surprised mothers, Claire Kellman, said, “They talk the same, they laugh the same, they hold their cigarettes the same — it’s uncanny.” She also said that she had learned about the other brothers (after the story broke) from Louise Wise Services, the agency that had placed the babies.The Times quoted a spokesman for Louise Wise, which specialized in Jewish adoptions, saying that the agency was “not at liberty to discuss the case.” But it had much to explain. First, though, Mr. Wardle tracks the fun stuff that happened after the brothers were reunited, in those giddy days when, as one of them puts it now, they were falling in love. In 1980, their story was as unclouded as it was irresistible. They were good looking and graced with curly halos and dazzling smiles that seemed bright enough to blot out every worry. The tabloids loved them. They even popped up with Madonna in “Desperately Seeking Susan,” leaning against a wall with mirrored grins and threads.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018The revelations about the brothers, their similar habits and quirks, not only stoked the media firestorm but also led to discussions about genetics and the influence of environment. On “The Phil Donahue Show,” the brothers sauntered out in near lock step, again in matching outfits, and answered questions in unison. As the audience tittered appreciatively, they said that they all smoked Marlboros and claimed to share similar taste in women. There were ripples disturbing the uniform picture they were helping create — one brother had been implicated in a crime — but their resemblances were charming and funny if a bit eerie. Nature seemed to have won this round over nurture.Nothing, though, would prove easy or obvious about their stories, which grow darker and more disturbing as “Three Identical Strangers” develops into a shocker. Puzzle piece by piece, interview by interview, Mr. Wardle fits together a grim story of hubristic doctors and their grotesquely unprincipled enablers who played with human lives in the name of science. It’s an ugly, familiar story as well as a historically specific one that has partly been told before by The New Yorker journalist Lawrence Wright (who appears here); in Lori Shinseki’s documentary “The Twinning Reaction”; and in “Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited,” by Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein.“Three Identical Strangers” is the latest chapter in a larger, sprawling chronicle of abuse that, in certain queasy moments, invokes memories of Josef Mengele and his twin experiments. Mr. Wardle relates that story smoothly and persuasively, but his telling sometimes provokes more questions than it answers. And there are instances in some of the fictional re-creations when he seems more invested in delivering an entertaining documentary than an informative one. During one stormy night dramatization, he deepens the shadows and cranks the suspense, embellishing material that — as this fine documentary makes clear — is already the stuff of fraught, memorable drama."

He’s a born anecdotalist with a lot of interesting friends. Whether he’s addressing the camera solo, or in the company of one of those friends — Rosie Perez is among the most prominent — he’s funny, likable, sympathetic.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 19, 2018Of course, when you’re the subject of a documentary like this, it helps to have a filmmaker who’s sympathetic, too. And in this case, Mr. Garcia, 51, is fortunate, as he is also the director of “Rock Rubber 45s.” He’s also the producer and music supervisor. That last credit is important. Mr. Garcia’s film has a pulsing visual energy, feeling like an Instagram feed brought to life, and the Latin and hip-hop music with which Mr. Garcia fortifies those images give the movie an infectious charm.Mr. Garcia’s multihyphenate feat of filmmaking is eyebrow-raising on the face of it. One recalls a vintage Norman Mailer title, “Advertisements for Myself.” But there is something about Mr. Garcia’s life story that makes him uniquely qualified to tell it. He became what some now call an influencer by following his feelings. And as a child of Puerto Rican parents (one of them abusive, he says) growing up in a mostly African-American New York neighborhood, he experienced intense and complex feelings of both alienation and belonging.We learn that once he got into a good school on a scholarship, his foster mom off campus was Patti LaBelle, who contributes fond reminiscences here. Mr. Garcia worked hard in the service of his passions, but a little serendipity always lifts one’s narrative."

Hlynur Palmason, born in Iceland but based in Copenhagen, shot the movie in and around a real-life limestone factory in Denmark, a location that allows Mr. Palmason and his sound designer, Lars Halvorsen, to give the film an extraordinary aural dimension. The clanks, drips and sirens of the workplace accumulate in a soundscape that suggests Björk crossed with “Stomp.” An electronic score by Toke Brorson Odin blends well into the industrial symphony.The movie also has a startling visual texture. Shooting on 16-millimeter film, Mr. Palmason, gliding his camera through snowy woods, has an eye for compositions that rhyme chalk-covered faces and wintry vistas. Although the way “Winter Brothers” is edited encourages a degree of disorientation, a narrative — either productively minimalist or simply underdeveloped, depending on your taste — gradually emerges.The protagonist, Emil (Elliott Crosset Hove), is a socially isolated employee at the factory. He estimates that he has worked there for between five and seven years (what’s the difference?) and doesn’t profess much interest in advancement. There is a hint of fraternal tension with his brother, a co-worker named Johan (Simon Sears).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 20, 2018CreditCreditKimStim Films“You know what your problem is?” Johan asks Emil at one point. “You don’t like anyone. You don’t like people.”“Johan, I am a person,” Emil replies. “How can I not like myself?”That exchange offers a taste of the movie’s mix of the bleak and the absurdist, although whether Emil is as innocent as he often acts is an open question. He steals chemicals from the factory to brew his own liquor, which almost certainly sickens one of the workers and leads to an ambush-like meeting with his boss (Lars Mikkelsen). Emil also creepily yearns for a young woman, Anna (Victoria Carmen Sonne), a longing that intensifies his rivalry with Johan.At times, Emil’s behavior puts him just to the lighter side of Travis Bickle. Having acquired a rifle, he watches a military training videotape and practices his shooting positions. It’s unclear whether the movie means to critique his aggression or, more troublingly, pat him on the back for rare assertiveness.On a character level, “Winter Brothers” is only arresting in individual moments: a brutally staged brawl in the buff between Johan and Emil, or Emil sweetly performing a trick of chemistry for Anna. Mr. Palmason’s showy technique, magnetic on its own, ultimately seems like a way of adding mystery to a story that, like Emil, is content with having no place to go."

Dumber, less inventive and not as pretentious as “Sicario” (released in 2015, directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Mr. Sheridan), it both advances and retreats, expanding on the original and narrowing its scope. Emily Blunt is missing, and so is some of the sharpness that made “Sicario” interesting. This time, we’re in more familiar genre territory.Just which genre “Day of the Soldado” belongs to takes a while to determine. When a jihadist suicide bomber blows himself up near the United States-Mexican border — an attack followed by another, even more horrific bombing in Kansas City, Mo. — you may think you know what’s coming: a Trump-era throwback to grim geopolitical revenger’s tales that flourished during the administration of George W. Bush. Sure enough, before too long, suspected terrorists are being chased down in various countries, hooded and interrogated without regard for the niceties of human rights.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 18, 2018CreditCreditRichard Foreman/Sony“This is Africa: I can do whatever I want,” says Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), the American operative in charge of the necessary dirty work. He’s the kind of rebel called on to do jobs that politicians and military careerists are too squeamish to handle. He favors sandals, cargo shorts and heavy facial hair, all signs of warrior iconoclasm. (Eventually things get intense enough for him to shave.) You know this guy, not only because you saw “Sicario” but also because you are aware of some of the other non-ironic Josh Brolin performances, most recently and germanely in “Deadpool 2.”But glimmers of irony, soupçons of subversion, start to appear amid the somber, super-violent, “24”-ish proceedings. Matt’s handler (Catherine Keener) and the weasely secretary of defense (Matthew Modine) preserve deniability by giving their guy carte blanche. His plan is to apply a lesson “we learned in Iraq,” namely that it’s easier to prevail when you make your enemies fight each other. Apparently that’s why that particular war went so well, which sounds more like a macabre joke than a sober assessment of policy. Mostly it’s sheer misdirection, a feint in the direction of global military conflict in a movie whose real concerns lie elsewhere.ImageBenicio Del Toro in “Sicario: Day of the Soldado.” In this world, his character is both predator and protector.CreditRichard Foreman/Sony PicturesMatt’s bright idea is to foment a war between two rival Mexican drug cartels, at least one of which might have helped the terrorists. He enlists the help of Mr. Sicario himself, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a stupefyingly competent killer with a personal grudge against one of the cartel bosses. That guy was responsible for the slaughter of Alejandro’s family, and in a twist of screenplay karma, Alejandro acquires extralegal custody of his enemy’s teenage daughter, Isabel Reyes (Isabela Moner).Meanwhile, another teenager, Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez), a Mexican-American boy with family on both sides of the border, joins a gang of human traffickers. How his story will entwine with the other threads of the plot is a significant source of suspense. Another is the relentlessly foreboding, throbbing score by Hildur Gudnadottir. Her music creates the impression that “Day of the Soldado” is a dark, high-stakes thriller, much as the bulked-up military hardware and souped-up operational jargon make it look like a war movie and the border backdrop gives it a sheen of sour topicality.ImageJosh Brolin is back in this sequel to “Sicario”CreditRichard Foreman/Sony PicturesBut the film’s deep genetic code — it’s true grit, speaking of Josh Brolin — is found in a handful of quieter scenes, most notably when Alejandro and Isabela encounter a poor family in the Mexican desert. The innocence and decency of these strangers, who have nothing to do with government strategy or criminal enterprise, signal the presence of the dusty and durable machinery of the western.The Spanish word “sicario,” usually translated as hit man or contract killer, has an accidental resemblance to the word samurai — the same first letter, the same pattern of consonants and vowels. (“Soldado” means soldier.) Alejandro is cousin both to the masterless swordsmen of Japanese cinema and to the lone gunslingers of the postwar Hollywood western. He exists at the margins of civilization, outside the reach of the law, but his limitless capacity for violence coexists with a deep ethical code. He is both predator and protector.Alejandro also possesses nearly superhuman — if not outright supernatural — survival skills, and “Day of the Sodaldo,” for all its lean macho bluster, flirts with silliness as well as sentimentality. Neither is entirely a bad thing. Mr. Sollima and Mr. Sheridan (who also wrote “Hell or High Water” and “Wind River,” two superior recent neo-westerns) are canny about what the audience might want in the way of cruelty, and also about how much we are likely to accept.Including how much reality. “Day of the Soldado” gestures toward a few from-the-headlines subjects and accidentally collides with others, but like most Hollywood movies of the moment, it keeps actual politics at a safe distance. Instead, it embraces a comforting form of cinematic conservatism, based on the mythical competence and essential decency of men whose vocation is violence. The two main adult male characters might look and act like brutal nihilists, but don’t worry. By the end, they put the “I care” in “Sicario” and remind everyone that you can’t spell “Soldado” without “Dad.”"

In part, it tells the familiar story of the poor little boy who became a king. But Mr. Jarecki has a second, larger and more complicated story he wants to address, too: that of the United States. Tying one man’s body to the body politic, he seeks to turn Presley’s life — from ravishing, thrilling youth to ravaging, putrefying fame — into the story of the country, an arc that takes the documentary from Graceland to Trumpland.Why Elvis? For Mr. Jarecki, the answer seems to be, why not? Mostly, though, there is the 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which came into Mr. Jarecki’s sights a few years back and serves as both the documentary’s roving stage and silent co-star. It’s a silver beast: huge, cumbersome-looking and temperamental. (It breaks down.)

Ward in the Rolls-Royce that serves as both the documentary’s roving stage and silent co-star.CreditDavid Kuhn/Oscilloscope LaboratoriesMr. Jarecki, who is regularly seen and heard throughout the movie, never goes into how he got behind the wheel of this pricey collector’s item (now resold), which is too bad because it provokes your curiosity. (I had to ask the publicist.) He just invites you to hop in while he steers you cross-country, following ribbons of road and a time line that shifts from the past to the present and back again. The details of some of that history are as familiar as a fairy tale, like the shotgun shack in Tupelo, Miss., where Presley was born on Jan. 8, 1935.He was the only surviving child of his beloved mother, Gladys, and his father, Vernon, who three years later was in prison for check forgery, just one of the many milestones that Mr. Jarecki passes as he quickly begins complicating his story. Working with a team of editors, he introduces Presley, the man and the myth, using an onslaught of archival images and sounds. In interviews and in early television appearances (hello, Ed Sullivan), the young Elvis rises to a mesmerizing, cacophonous chorus: “We want Elvis, we want Elvis!”Mr. Jarecki complies, delivering Presley with the help of a large group of revolving guests that includes James Carville, who soon after slipping into the Rolls invokes Mike Tyson, another fallen god. Mr. Jarecki likes to visually embroider the dialogue, and as Mr. Carville speaks, the movie cuts to Mr. Tyson delivering a devastating blow in the ring. “Mike Tyson,” Mr. Carville says, “hit you so hard he changes the way you taste.” Then it’s back to Mr. Carville opining on Elvis in the Rolls: “America never tasted the same after he hit.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 12, 2018This show-and-tell strategy is diverting — as are guests like Ethan Hawke — but “The King” is at its strongest when Mr. Jarecki uses his material to build an actual argument. That’s what happens when he enters a juicy virtual discussion about Presley, white supremacy, black heritage and cultural appropriation that features Van Jones, Chuck D and the TV auteur David Simon (“The Wire”), who are united through the editing. “It’s important to recognize,” Mr. Jones says, “that Elvis as hero does not rest comfortably in the mouths of all Americans.” Mr. Jarecki seems to let Chuck D and Mr. Simon do the talking for him. “Listen,” Mr. Simon says, “the entire American experience is cultural appropriation.”Every documentary is also a chronicle of its own moment, and so it’s no surprise that throughout “The King” Mr. Jarecki restlessly looks at contemporary America as he tracks Presley’s path from Tupelo to Memphis, Nashville and beyond, and simultaneously heads toward Donald J. Trump, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and beyond. Mr. Jarecki’s weaving of past and present makes seamless sense — even if images of Tupelo today say more than his brief, rather opportunistic visit with a few residents — but at other times his searching feels like reaching. One of the most attractive things about Mr. Jarecki as a filmmaker, though, is that he’s comfortable letting you see him struggle.“What do you think I’m doing with this movie,” Mr. Jarecki asks as “The King” nears its midpoint. He’s riding shotgun, and Wayne Gerster, a crew member, is behind the wheel. “I don’t know what the hell you’re doing with this movie,” Mr. Gerster gruffly replies. “I’m not sure you know what you’re doing, that’s what’s scary.” He ventures a reasonable guess, offering that Mr. Jarecki is after “some comparison between — I hate to say ‘fall’ — but the rise and decline of Elvis with the rise and decline of America.” Mr. Gerster volunteers his own take on the country (he believes it’s stagnant), even as Mr. Jarecki listens and continues on his search.He finds a great deal throughout “The King,” which finally proves more seductive than persuasive, particularly as Presley and Mr. Jarecki approach the finish and the screen turns into an imagistic, intellectual blur: Elvis falling, the twin towers burning, candidates rallying and Barney the purple dinosaur waving. It’s a chaotic end, but the journey is the destination in a movie that gives you plenty to think about and argue with, as it racks up the miles and people clamber in and out of both the Rolls and the movie. While most of the Presley experts Mr. Jarecki confers with are men (an unfortunate lapse), this otherwise generous, perceptive director, more than anything, clearly yearns to fit not only Elvis but also the whole wide world into his sweet ride."

But the first words heard in it are in English. As a handsome teen, the movie’s presumed protagonist, bicycles down a stretch of thruway untroubled by auto traffic, the beautiful, moving 1965 folk ballad “Blues Run the Game,” by Jackson C. Frank, plays on the soundtrack. “Wherever I have gone,” Frank sings, “the blues are all the same.” And this movie, written and directed by João Dumans and Affonso Uchôa, sees “the blues” as a universal language and condition.André, the cycling teen played by Murilo Caliari, lives with his younger brother and his aunt Márcia (Gláucia Vandeveld) in a glum factory town, where Márcia works as a nurse to laborers. André has no friends his own age, and not much to do. His parents are not just absent, but not at all heard from (they “travel,” Márcia tells one of her patients). During one afternoon driving with André, Márcia spots a factory worker named Cristiano and offers him a ride. Small of stature, thin but muscled, Cristiano, beautifully incarnated by Aristides de Sousa, cuts an unprepossessing figure. A little afterward, the worker is felled in a factory accident, and goes into a coma. Sent to Cristiano’s quarters to fetch some of his possessions, André comes upon a spiral notebook containing a journal. He reads it.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 12, 2018CreditCreditGrasshopper FilmAnd it’s here that the film properly begins, as an account of ten years of Cristiano’s life, narrated through the journal pages. An auto theft done on a lark in his teens nets him a year and change in prison. Once sprung, he wanders the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, picking fruit for no money, then working on a road project. Cristiano’s human connections are with the old friends who helped him get the work; of an evening they’ll get together, pass around a guitar and sing songs. After a grisly auto accident puts him in fear of another prison stint (the Frank song plays again, this time on the truck’s radio before the crash), he flees from a job renovating a brothel. Then, while working at a textile factory, he falls in love with one of his supervisors (Renata Cabral). The affair ends, but they maintain a correspondence after Cristiano arrives at his current job. Cristiano’s work and life go on, until they don’t. “Araby” doesn’t show the event that caused his coma, but these moments leading up to it help to expand its meaning.The directors have a refined style — the shooting and editing tell of a sensibility informed by Robert Bresson, the Dardenne brothers and Cristian Mungiu — but it doesn’t always fully pay off. When Márcia speaks to André in the hospital, she’s artfully posed in the frame, but she also looks like she’s talking to the window. And yet, thanks to Mr. de Sousa’s superb performance, the movie often convincingly portrays not just the exploited condition of laborers such as Cristiano, but the nagging sadness of life itself."

Marlina, a young widow living in remote Indonesia, spills blood in a story that plays out in four discrete acts. Each of the titled acts telegraphs some impending event (“The Robbery,” “The Birth”) and is clearly meant to create a mild sense of anticipation, much like the movie’s own explanatory title. Mostly, these are self-aware art-film touches ornamenting a blunt rape-revenge story that leans heavily and sometimes effectively on its sweeping landscapes, aesthetic violence, nods to Sergio Leone and what comes across as an overt debt to Jia Zhang-ke’s “Touch of Sin.”The first act unfolds at the small, isolated home where Marlina (a restrained, often opaque Marsha Timothy) lives with a dog, livestock and the mummified corpse of her husband. The animals mostly stay outdoors while the husband’s swaddled corpse is inside, propped against the wall in a seated position, open hands flanking his head as if in permanent deep thought. (A grave outside the house points to another death, one revealed later.) Marlina lives simply and presumably on the yield from her pigs, goats and chickens, though the director, Mouly Surya, doesn’t spend much time on Marlina’s ordinary life. What interests Ms. Surya is violence and its aftermath, which she visually plots with geometric precision.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 12, 2018Violence enters with a stranger, later identified as a bandit named Markus (Egi Fedly). Swaggering into Marlina’s house uninvited, he immediately makes himself at home, demanding food and announcing that he and his friends will also rape her. A small group of men arrive later and, like Markus, insist that Marlina feed them. The entire interlude passes by quickly, with a mounting sense of dread. Ms. Surya stages most of the invasion indoors, creating a sense of entrapment; there’s no place for Marlina to hide, no place for her to run. Ms. Surya also imbues the episode with a slightly stiff, vague theatricality that suggests that each character is playing his or her designated role.By the end of Act 1, Marlina has been brutally victimized, but most of her assaulters are now dead. When Act 2 — “The Journey” — opens, she is on the move and carrying Markus’s severed head like a market watermelon. After a chat with a pregnant neighbor, Novi (Dea Panendra), who has troubles of her own (and remains remarkably unfazed by the grisly head), Marlina pushes on and the story morphs into a road movie with western flavor. On foot, by bus and on horseback, she travels into a rugged, depopulated world, heading toward hoped-for justice as the tale meanders and pauses. Violence and its threat reverberate throughout, punctuated by an occasional Ennio Morricone-like wah-wah-waaah.Working with the cinematographer Yunus Pasolang, Ms. Surya gives “Marlina” a stark, steady, captivating look that keeps you largely engaged even when the story and your attention drift. The visuals and especially the locations do a lot of work, pulling you in with their unadorned natural beauty. Ms. Surya smartly foregrounds all that comeliness and every so often folds in a long shot that turns the characters into doll-like figures, a downsizing that gestures toward a nature vs. culture dynamic, maybe. She opens a lot of interpretive room for the viewer — mostly through ambiguity and the withholding lead performance — a strategy that can be liberating but here too often feels like mannerism."

The blank space in the title represents a word that cannot be published here, connoting the urgency of her mission.Even setting aside a prologue in Santa Monica — where Izzy (Ms. Davis) wakes up hung over next to a one-night stand (Lakeith Stanfield, billed as Keith Stanfield) — the vagaries of Los Angeles transit, and Izzy’s newness to the city, this is not a journey that should take all day.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 12, 2018But Izzy has a habit of getting sidetracked. Her afternoon’s activities include helping an alcoholic (Alia Shawkat) who is giving her a ride break into a house; being stabbed with a hypodermic needle; and playing a duet of Heavens to Betsy’s “Axemen” with her now-domesticated sister (Carrie Coon), her former musical partner.That last bit makes for a showstopping scene, partly because Ms. Coon and Ms. Davis can belt a tune, and partly because it gives the movie a moment to breathe. Watching Izzy’s frenzied pratfalls often feels like watching a documentary of Ms. Davis — always great — running a hamster wheel that powers uninspired comic material.Then comes the ending, which has an ambiguity and emotional complexity that the writer-director, Christian Papierniak, has done little to earn. The last 10 minutes aren’t worth getting across town for, but they’re something, at least."

Instead of offering a sprawling overview, Ms. Fairrie profiles individuals and families in France and Israel, in an apparent effort to capture a cycle of fear and xenophobia that, if exposed, might also offer hope for rapprochement.There is the Duran family, Parisian Jews preparing to leave France because of anti-Semitism. There is a lawyer prosecuting Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a comedian convicted in 2015 of condoning terrorism and known for making anti-Semitic statements.

François, a schoolteacher in the Jewish section of Sarcelles, remembers a time in his youth when Jews and Arabs in France were united. He suggests to his class that the way Jews have set themselves apart in the community rather than mingling with their neighbors has contributed to their own fear.Ms. Fairrie also visits Israel, interviewing a Jewish man from Manchester, England, who has become a settler in the West Bank with his family and the mayor of a Palestinian village.The upshot of the film is a little murky, which is the risk of such a diffuse, dialectical approach, and certain details could be clearer. By dividing a movie on this topic between France and Israel, Ms. Fairrie implicitly turns anti-Israel sentiment into a reductive scapegoat for anti-Semitism. Elsewhere, the degree to which far-right politicians like Marine Le Pen have grown in stature by stoking anti-Muslim hostility gets shortchanged in the movie’s account.“Spiral” is best in smaller-bore moments, showing how everyday lives are affected by prejudice.“We can’t deny that our children are more French than Israeli,” says the patriarch of the Duran family, in voice over, as the film shows them leaving for their flight.The English settler, who believes that his family lives on divinely given land, doesn’t traffic in ambiguities. “This is a place where you’re stepping on people’s toes,” he says of the West Bank. “We’re not obsessed with it.”"

Yet as entertaining as they are, Christopher Lloyd’s mischievous art forger and Peter Fonda’s vaping hipster are mere comic devices, props for loony misadventures.Self-satisfied and too slick by half, “Boundaries” projects a sheen of artifice that deflects any genuine engagement with the story. Ms. Farmiga is warmly appealing, and Mr. Plummer drizzles a welcome acidity over Jack’s roguish shtick. But a fine cast (including Bobby Cannavale as Laura’s feckless ex-husband) can’t compensate for the screenplay’s superficial sentimentality and lazy slapstick.

As it happens, the story line is plucked from the marginalia of World War II history. And from the history of American baseball.Morris, a.k.a. Moe, Berg, the protagonist of this based-on-true-events picture, was of that once elite and now seemingly rather rare breed, the scholar athlete. A Princeton graduate fluent in more than half a dozen languages, he passed the New York bar exam while beginning his professional baseball career as player and coach in the early 1920s.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 12, 2018This movie sketches out his career with several teams (notably the Boston Red Sox) and his intriguing personal life, and then it concentrates on his most dangerous, and emotionally fraught, overseas mission for the United States government: a confrontation with the German physicist Werner Heisenberg. Berg’s assignment is to determine whether the scientist is making a fission bomb for the Nazis. His orders are unambiguous: If he believes Heisenberg has embarked on such a project, he is to assassinate him.Paul Rudd plays Berg with the droll, boyish charm he’s brought to dozens of other roles, but he adds a protective coating. This movie, directed by Ben Lewin from a Robert Rodat script (one adapted from Nicholas Dawidoff’s fascinating 1994 biography of Berg), relishes Berg’s compulsion to remain an enigma even to those closest to him. He conducts a passionate affair with a piano teacher named Estella (Sienna Miller). In their first scene together, he is so moved by her playing that he stands her up, lifts her skirt and bends her over the keyboard. And when asked if he’s gay — a question that comes up in both his baseball and military worlds — he defers. “I’m good at keeping secrets” is all he’ll say to his Army mentor (Jeff Daniels) after being asked point blank.“The Catcher Was a Spy” has what they used to call an all-star cast: Guy Pearce, Connie Nielsen, Mark Strong, Paul Giamatti, Tom Wilkinson and Giancarlo Giannini all are used to excellent effect. This is also an unusually literate movie, one that cites Heisenberg’s own famous uncertainty principle the better to bring it to bear on the scenario itself. Berg and Heisenberg conduct most of their dialogue, when they finally meet, in chess moves. And the movie tantalizingly leaves open the question of whether the game ended in a mate or a resignation."

The “Fallen Kingdom” part is also frankly a little obscure. The mistake, however, might be to suppose that these words mean anything at all. Sense is a thing this movie doesn’t have much interest in making.Which is far from the worst that can be said about it. When the first “Jurassic Park” movie (based on a novel by Michael Crichton) opened in 1993, it was both a parable and an example of extravagant human ambition. One well-intentioned, misguided visionary (Richard Attenborough) used genetic engineering to revive of long-extinct species. Another (Steven Spielberg) used special effects to the same end. The results were a little ridiculous, but also scary, thrilling and intermittently thought-provoking.Image“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” has big-name actors, yes, but the stars here are clear.CreditUniversal PicturesThat was hubris. This is business. The reawakening of the slumbering franchise in 2015 gave birth to “Jurassic World,” one of the highest-grossing terrible movies of all time, a lumbering walk in the rebooted park that squandered the charisma of the big lizards and the charm of the human cast in a witless farrago of blockbuster self-importance. “Fallen Kingdom,” directed by J. A. Bayona, is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun. Some of its high jinks have a hokey, silly, old-fashioned mad-scientist feeling to them, especially when the dinosaurs are chasing people or vice versa. Which is reasonably often.Mr. Bayona and the screenwriters, Colin Trevorrow (who directed “Jurassic World”) and Derek Connolly (who was a co-writer of it), try to atone for the sexism that was one of the most remarked-upon features of the last installment. This time, Bryce Dallas Howard is outfitted with practical footwear. There is a “nasty woman” joke and a visual gag at the expense of President Trump’s hair. None of this should be mistaken for topicality. The semi-interesting ethical questions that have hovered around Jurassic Park since the beginning — what are the limits of human tampering with nature? What obligations do we owe to imaginary creatures? — have been stretched to almost invisible thinness. The park is gone! It’s time to go into the house.Because the filmmakers decided that the best thing to do with the rampaging digital dinosaurs was to bring them indoors. The tropical island off the coast of whatever is emptied out so that the giant proto-birds could be moved to a mansion in Northern California. Supposedly the creatures are there to be protected from a cruel re-extinction policy, but actually they are pawns in a diabolical scheme to breed super-weapons that can be auctioned off to a gathering of international bad guys.And it would have worked, if not for you meddling kids! To be precise, there is one meddling kid, named Maisie (Isabella Sermon). She is the granddaughter of the estate’s owner, Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), who was involved in the development of the original park. The other non-lizard residents include Maisie’s governess, Iris (Geraldine Chaplin), and Mr. Lockwood’s assistant, Eli (Rafe Spall), who totally seems like a nice guy.ImageBryce Dallas Howard is back, this time as a dinosaur-rights activist.CreditUniversal PicturesClaire Dearing (Ms. Howard), who has become a dinosaur-rights activist, reunites with the swashbuckling animal-behavior specialist Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to do the necessary wrangling. They are joined by Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) — younger, nerdier adventurers clipped from the newly updated 2018 edition of the Big Book of Action-Movie Clichés.I don’t mind those, necessarily. There are moments when “Fallen Kingdom” operates in breezy awareness of its own ridiculousness, embracing its second-rate, secondhand status as a way for people with no other plans to grab some air-conditioning. But in the current entertainment ecosystem, the good-faith B movie is not so much an endangered species as a genetic impossibility. To survive, you need either aggressive, frantically winking self-consciousness, end-of-the-world portentousness, or both. “Fallen Kingdom” has neither. It makes a few gestures toward “Planet of the Apes”-style apocalypticism, attempts a bit of tongue-in-cheeky humor and phones in the rest.The cast more or less does the same. Mr. Pratt’s affable, teddy-bear machismo grows staler with each movie. Ms. Howard’s character has been given a cliché-book upgrade to generic Strong Female Character. Apart from Toby Jones, the villains lack diabolical flair. The dinosaurs show more personality.But not as much as they used to. Their ability to elicit wonder, terror and empathetic recognition — the whole point of this franchise, after all — has declined even as the capacities of computer-generated imagery have expanded. Now I think I understand. The kingdom has fallen. The park is gone. Welcome to the petting zoo."

Played by John Travolta, this is John Gotti ostensibly at his dapper peak. Mr. Travolta’s charismatic, high-voltage smile is wide, and he approximates the real-life Gotti’s speech credibly. So far, so good. Then you hear the words coming out of his mouth. Mobsters such as himself end up “dead or in jail,” according to his little speech. “I did both.”Good grief. The conceit of Gotti speaking to the audience from beyond the grave might have been more effective had he been given dialogue that didn’t make him sound like an idiot.There does exist the possibility that John Gotti was an idiot. But because the movie, written by Lem Dobbs and Leo Rossi (an actor who appears in the film while also serving as one of approximately 700 credited producers), never attains a point of view on the character, one can’t really say.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018The movie, directed by the actor Kevin Connolly, does not recover from the opening outburst. Its unstuck-in-time structure is, one supposes, meant to be anchored by a scene threaded through the narrative in which Gotti’s eldest son, John A. Gotti, visits his ailing father in prison.But “Gotti” mostly incoherently bounces around the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, recounting “highlights” of his criminal exploits, including the assassination of the mob boss Paul Castellano in 1985. One suspects that jumbled structure was used because a linear account of Gotti’s criminal career would reveal little beyond banal tawdriness.Far from being any kind of Machiavellian mastermind, the Gotti here is driven by mere resentment. In a nightclub, conferring with an underboss, he points out various thugs and notes his dislike and distrust of them all. This Gotti is nothing more nor less than petty, but again, the movie declines to put that trait in the service of any point.For many scenes, it seems that Mr. Connolly asked himself, “What would Martin Scorsese do?” All his answers are wrong. His staging of shots is not even rudimentary. And when he tries for a slightly sophisticated effect, he whiffs. There’s a shallow-focus view of Gotti and his crew walking down the street near their social club. The background is impressionistically out of focus as intended, while the characters walking toward the camera are … well, they’re out of focus, too. Just less out of focus than the background.The use of period pop music on the soundtrack here is probably influenced by Mr. Scorsese’s “Goodfellas.” Except the choices are on-the-nose dull or out-and-out hilarious. The killing of Castellano, which occurred in December, is accompanied by Elvis Presley’s “Silent Night.” Mr. Connolly even throws in Isaac Hayes’s “Theme From ‘Shaft.’” You don’t put the “Theme From ‘Shaft’” in a movie that is not “Shaft.” Come on."

Watch it once, and you could come away a little underwhelmed; watch it twice, and you begin to suspect that its almost humdrum rhythms are exactly the point.In addressing a conflict that has lasted over 15 years, maybe our movies are as exhausted as the troops themselves. Here, two young soldiers (perfectly embodied by Alden Ehrenreich and Tye Sheridan) leave for Iraq, but only one comes home and he’s not talking. What happens before, during and after their deployment is largely, tragically unremarkable — scenes that have unfolded in similar fashion in more than a few war dramas before them. Their potency, however, is no less for that, given how closely the director, Alexandre Moors, attends to his small band of brothers (including a terrific Jack Huston as their sergeant) and how compassionate his gaze.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018Filming in Morocco, the cinematographer Daniel Landin paints vivid, near-alien landscapes studded with flaming vegetation and shockingly abrupt violence. As the mystery of the recruit’s disappearance is slowly unveiled and the emotional baton passes to his bewildered mother (Jennifer Aniston), the director refuses to sensationalize the tragedy, melting it into a broader narrative of everyday horrors.Capped by a truly lovely final shot, “The Yellow Birds” (the title comes from a particularly cruel Army cadence) is about unseen wounds and wasted lives. The closer we get to these young men, the closer we are to wondering how many more of these stories we can bear to hear."

I must have misread my notes. While “Tag,” directed by Jeff Tomsic and distributed by the venerable Warner Bros. studio, is indeed about that popular, sublimely simple children’s pastime, it is actually an R-rated feature film whose cast consists almost entirely of actors in their 40s. In 21st-century America, we work hard to keep children away from mischief, idle fun and unsupervised play. Their lives are structured around play dates, test prep and lockdown drills. Silly stuff is strictly for grown-ups.Which is to say that “Tag” is a late, anxious variation on the dominant theme of modern American film comedy, namely the headlong flight from maturity. This has been mostly but not exclusively a guy thing, and the five tag-playing pals in the movie — who are based on a real squad of adorable man-children profiled in The Wall Street Journal five years ago — are all dudes. Care has been taken to certify their masculinity as a nontoxic variety, and the “no girls allowed” rule governing their long-running game is justified by the fact that they were 9 when they started out.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018Ever since, with necessary adjustments and amendments, these friends have devoted every May to chasing one another around and shouting “you’re it.” This has not so much arrested their development as provided an oasis of youthful frolic in the midst of life’s other business. At least one of them, a veterinarian named Hoagie (Ed Helms), is married, and his wife, Anna (Isla Fisher), is nearly as enthusiastic about tag as he is. Chilli (Jake Johnson) is a divorced stoner; Bob Callahan (Jon Hamm) is the single C.E.O. of an insurance company; Sable (Hannibal Buress) is a man of unspecified professional and marital status who is surprised by three of the others in the middle of a therapy session.His shrink is played by Carrie Brownstein, one of a handful of stellar supporting performers sprinkled into the movie like macadamia nuts in a cookie. Others include Lil Rel Howery as Hoagie’s temporary boss, Rashida Jones as the crush who got away from both Chilli and Callahan, and Nora Dunn as Hoagie’s flirtatious mother. Chilli’s father is played by Brian Dennehy, which also happens to be the name of one of the real-life taggers.Four of the fictional ones — Chilli, Hoagie, Sable and Callahan (they only call him Bob when they’re teasing him) — head back to Spokane, Wash., where they all grew up, to find Jerry (Jeremy Renner), a fitness guru who is about to get married and who is threatening to quit the game. (They are joined by a Wall Street Journal reporter played by Annabelle Wallis.) At first, Jerry’s fiancée, Susan (Leslie Bibb), looks like a killjoy mom-wife in the “Hangover” vein, but “Tag,” which was written by Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen, subverts that cliché and makes Susan the agent of a singularly nasty and surprising gag.There are just enough of those — physical, verbal and conceptual — to lift “Tag” above the slough of mediocrity in which big-screen, big-studio comedy seems, at the moment, to be mired. While its humor is generally cautious and its characters a little too insistently likable, the story does wander into a few dark corners of middle age: romantic disappointment; addiction and recovery; the possibility of illness and the inevitability of death.To say that these matters are handled with a light touch would be to give the film too much credit. It gestures in their direction and then changes the subject, and settles into a soft cushion of masculine sentimentality at the end. But “Tag,” unlike too many of its recent ilk, at least bothers to be a movie, rather than a television sketch distended to feature length. The performers don’t seem to have been shoved in front of the camera and instructed to be funny. They have to work for their laughs, and to find coherence as an ensemble. Mr. Tomsic, a TV journeyman, executes both the dumb pratfalls and the quick banter with discipline and professionalism. Perhaps more than was called for, given that this is a movie about a game that is fun precisely because it requires very little in the way of skill, strategy or brains."

O.K., I had some lox, but probably only because the movie doesn’t deal with ocean fish.Christopher Quinn’s documentary makes a persuasive, far-ranging case against factory farming, which it skewers from philosophical, epidemiological and even economic perspectives. Factory farms may make it possible to feed more people, but their environmental effects may make their efficiency a Pyrrhic victory. The movie isn’t even advocating vegetarianism. But it seems impossible to come away from it without wanting to know more about where your meat comes from.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018The subject is familiar from documentaries like “Food, Inc.” and books like Michael Pollan’s “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” and Jonathan Safran Foer’s “Eating Animals” (2009), of which the documentary is at once an adaptation and an extension.Being a movie, it can show us Frank Reese, a Kansas poultry farmer who carries on old traditions, at work with his turkeys. We hear from others who aren’t in the book, like Craig Watts, a former Perdue contractor who blew the whistle on the way chickens raised for the company were treated, and James Keen, who approached The New York Times to expose animal mistreatment at a government research center in Nebraska.Natalie Portman (along with Mr. Foer, one of the producers) provides the narration. If there is a weak point in the movie’s argument, it concerns demand. Plant-based meat substitutes may be our future, but the broader public isn’t clamoring for them to replace burgers.Even so, this upsetting documentary offers plenty to chew on."

Izzy (Madelyn Deutch) is the elder sister, a college graduate in limbo after the recent suicide of her father. In mourning, she decides to commit to youthful disorientation, embarking on a year of part-time gigs and one-night stands. Her inconstancy is thrown into sharp contrast by her movie-star sibling, Sabrina (Zoey Deutch), who shepherds Izzy through her exploits with Type A efficiency.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018Though “The Year of Spectacular Men” never quite reaches comedic elegance, this heavily scripted movie is not as flat-footed as the hapless Izzy. There is a tuneful rhythm to the dialogue that might have been lost in a looser comedy, and the pleasure of watching actors throw lines back and forth is particularly evident in scenes between Izzy and Sabrina, whose chemistry reflects their real-life sibling bond.But the script, by Madelyn Deutch, is uneven, and for every punch line that lands, another undermines good timing with dated references and clichés. When the awkward clangers are kept between siblings, they are easy to tune out. But when Izzy and Sabrina turn their sights to their mother, Deb (Lea Thompson), and her romance with a female yoga instructor, the script’s cracks about New Age lesbians strike a sour note in this mostly sweet affair. Even in such spotty passages, it is the movie’s saving grace that its family acting troupe faces the gobbledygook with openhearted silliness and sincerity."

This is apparently true. “Straight Into a Storm,” an affectionate documentary directed by William Miller, celebrates Deer Tick, a band from Rhode Island that has appeared to exemplify a variety of rock ’n’ roll virtues.To wit: The band is loud; it has maintained a kind of dogs-of-the-road work ethic in spite of periodic substance-related impairment; and it makes sincere, foursquare music with metaphor-packed lyrics such as the one that gives this movie its title.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 8, 2018Thirty years ago, Deer Tick could have been as big as, well, maybe not Nirvana, but certainly the Replacements and Uncle Tupelo combined. The band, fronted for the most part by John McCauley — who maintains half-wasted bad-boy charisma throughout the movie’s archival footage — has affinities with all of those groups. And yet, since rock is no longer the dominant genre of popular music, a success milestone for Deer Tick was selling out downtown New York’s Bowery Ballroom, a venue with a capacity of 575.But being a cult concern — and the cult has grown over time, as the movie centers on six nights’ worth of 10th-anniversary gigs at a 600-capacity house — allows rockers to maintain auras of integrity and authenticity. Deer Tick’s iteration of an earnest, gruff-voiced, white-guy musical incorruptibility doesn’t float my boat, but it is what it is.What fascinated me most about the movie was its likely inadvertent depiction of the comfortable bubble the band and its fandom seem to have created for each other. It’s a realm in which, for example, Deer Tick’s drummer, Dennis Ryan, can convince himself that writing a song about the serial killer John Wayne Gacy constitutes some kind of flirtation with profundity."

There, a few cops berate the superhero Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and his wife and partner in heroics, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), for meddling. They left a swath of destruction in their wake, and besides the bank was insured. Mr. Incredible transforms into Mr. Indignant, declaring that they didn’t start the fight, which is an amusingly self-serving way to jump-start a sequel.The cops have a point, of course, but there’s no fun in insurance, which Mr. Incredible and his admirers know. Under the name Bob Parr, he used to work in insurance — that is until he angrily tossed his boss through a couple of walls. That was 14 years ago in “The Incredibles,” the movie that introduced the superhero clan whose members have unique abilities. Insurance was part of the normalizing disguise that Bob and the Family Parr wore to hide the brilliant gifts that are at once their calling and their art (and sometimes their burden). Few can rearrange the world as artfully and as enjoyably as the Incredibles, except of course their creator Brad Bird.And, like his superheroes, Mr. Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful “Incredibles 2,” which picks up narratively where the last movie left off. It’s still a fantasy 1962 or thereabouts as the boxy cars, clothing and midcentury modern flourishes suggest, but advances in computer animation make everything — from downy hair to brick buildings — look far sharper and more fine-grained. Here, you can almost count the stubble on Bob’s unshaven face and trace the swirls in the billowing, churning dust clouds that form after an explosion.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018All that detail is so exquisitely rendered that it would be easy to get lost in the movie’s particulars: to bask in the silvery glow of Elastigirl’s uniforms, to ooh and aah over the striking design of a luxurious hideaway worthy of a Bond villain, to meditate on the David Hockney-esque patterns of the water in a motel pool seen at night. But once again, and more so than in the first installment, Mr. Bird is working to the steady beat of a classic action movie — ka-boom, yakety-yak, ka-boom — so much so that there are times when you wish that he would slow things down and let you luxuriate longer in the sheer loveliness of his images.No such luck. Mr. Bird, who wrote and directed, clearly had a lot that he wanted to cram into this sequel, which runs two fast hours. The story is often the least of it, though it has its moments, including some awkward asides on free enterprise (good), government (not so much), women working outside the home (right on) and feminism (it’s complicated). Soon after the movie takes off, the Incredibles learn that the government has shut down the secret program under which they’ve lived and worked, leaving them stuck in a motel with no prospects. “Politicians,” someone laments, “don’t understand people who do something good because it’s right.”In steps a savior, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), a suspiciously upbeat zillionaire who runs a giant telecommunications company with his watchful sister, Evelyn (Catherine Keener). A longtime superhero admirer, Winston — Win for short — has both the means and a plan to relegitimize superheroes in the eyes of the public, one that involves putting surveillance cameras in their suits. As the words “superhero lives matter” formed in my head, I wondered, and not for the first time while watching this movie, what exactly Mr. Bird was trying to say as he gestured toward reality while only tentatively engaging it.These references to the real world pop up every so often like teasingly, briefly hoisted red flags. They flutter a bit, and then Mr. Bird gets back to the main event, which mostly involves the Incredibles agreeing to Win’s plan and all the busy, cartoonish rest. The story cleaves in two, with Elastigirl, a.k.a. Helen Parr, out in the field fighting crime and Bob at home taking care of the kids. The new division of family labor is hard on Bob — their daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell), has boy problems, for starters — but his Mr. Mom bumbling predictably gives way to heroic fatherhood. In between feedings and putting out fires, Bob teaches his son Dash (Huckleberry Milner) how to conquer new math and, better yet, seeks help caring for the baby, Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile).ImageElastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) goes into the field to fight crime while her husband (Craig T. Nelson) stays behind to take care of the kids.CreditDisney/PixarJack-Jack is the burbling, gurgling cherry on this confection whether he’s toddling through the house or tussling with a wily raccoon. (Mr. Bird’s nostalgic side is evident in the name Jack-Jack, which evokes the epithet John-John given to John F. Kennedy Jr. when he was a toddler in the White House.) It’s a blast when Jack-Jack spends time with a super-suit designer, Edna Mode (voiced by Mr. Bird) — this irresistible duo could easily spin into their own sequel nirvana — but it’s Jack-Jack’s kinetic dust-up with the raccoon that gives the movie its most delightful moments as baby and beast zip, zing and ping like Tom and Jerry in gloriously controlled chaos.Part of what makes Jack-Jack’s scramble with the (conveniently clawless) raccoon so pleasurable is its playfulness and relatively small scale. The scene reveals much about Jack-Jack’s abilities, but crucially, it doesn’t directly advance the larger story and isn’t weighted down by the big-bigger-biggest blockbuster-action imperative that often finds directors (Mr. Bird included) trying to top not only other movies but also, scene to scene, themselves. Jack-Jack’s raccoon time is pure play, which is something that “Incredibles 2” — with its self-aware political comments, its Bruckheimer-esque fireballs and all its locked, loaded guns — could use more of.Too often Mr. Bird seems to think that he needs to say something to the adults in the room, including those critics who have sniffed notes of Ayn Rand perfuming his work. (At least one plot point seems like a direct refutation of that reading.) In “Incredibles 2,” the government can’t be relied on, but it also, until recently, had been footing the bill for the Incredibles. And while the family certainly is special, as the movie underscores, the Incredibles don’t want to withdraw from the world. They want to save it and, importantly, save it together. It’s a hot mess, populated by looters and the usual moochers, but its un-incredibles also give the Incredibles purpose.The family that fights together remains the steadily throbbing, unbreakable heart of “Incredibles 2,” even when Bob and Helen swap traditional roles. There’s something too self-conscious — overcompensating much? — about Bob’s taking on the part of the stay-at-home father and Helen’s embarking on her solo adventures. Mr. Bird even throws in a line about strong women. Plunking the Incredibles down in the early 1960s informed the first movie’s graphic midcentury cartoon style. It also allowed Mr. Bird to stick to a comfortably old-fashioned vision of the world, one that he is redrawing one baby superhero step at a time."

He had been taking a year to travel the world before starting a graduate program at U.C.L.A., and he was expecting to fly home to Rio de Janeiro shortly. The last months of Buchmann’s life are the subject of “Gabriel and the Mountain,” a film by his friend Fellipe Gamarano Barbosa that is a perceptive and poetic hybrid of documentary and fiction. It both captures and gently critiques Gabriel’s free-spirited, adventurous sensibility.Gabriel is played by an impish, energetic actor named João Pedro Zappa, and his girlfriend, Cristina Reis — who meets Gabriel in Dar es Salaam and accompanies him for part of his journey — is played by Caroline Abras, also a professional. With one other exception, everybody else in the movie is someone who knew Gabriel, playing him or herself. The people he met along the way re-enact their encounters, which are mostly friendly but occasionally tense. They also reminisce about him in on- and off-camera interviews. Mr. Barbosa’s use of photographs taken by Gabriel himself, and of passages from letters he wrote to his family in Brazil, heightens the uncanny sense of his simultaneous presence and absence.Early on, during a stay at a village in Kenya, Gabriel hears some children referring to him as mzungu, which means white man. “But I’m not,” he says. “I’m from Brazil. It’s more complicated!” Racial identity in Brazil is certainly that, and so are the dynamics of power and privilege that inevitably arise when relatively wealthy people travel in mostly poor places. Gabriel is aware of those contradictions, and also frustrated by them.His disdain for “tourism” — his desire for empathy, equality and “sustainability” in his relations with the residents of the places he visits — is sincere, and also patently naïve. His itinerary includes Mount Kilimanjaro, Victoria Falls and a safari in the Serengeti, and he spends a fair amount of time haggling with guides and drivers. He throws a small tantrum when the safari leader won’t take him to see migrating wildebeest.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018But the rough edges and annoying aspects of his temperament are part of Gabriel’s charm, and they lend credibility to Mr. Barbosa’s portrait. The chapters dealing with Christina’s visit are like a novel in miniature. The couple’s squabbles and tender moments, the way they alternate between ease and unease in each other’s company, are interesting in their own right, but also connect with the larger ideas the film sets out to explore. An extended scene on a bus in Tanzania in which Gabriel and Christina argue about the role of state investment in economic development (and also about the future of their relationship) is a tour de force. The camera and the performers capture unstated nuances of feeling, while registering the wonderful absurdity of the situation.Gabriel’s sense of the absurd and his willingness to recognize his own foolishness make him a worthwhile companion, even though, the film suggests, his stubborn insistence on doing things his own way may have cost him his life. It is easy enough to poke holes in his romantic view of himself and the world, but it’s also hard to deny the infectious humanism that drove him.“Gabriel and the Mountain” finds a form for that impulse, a way to appreciate and make sense of it. More than a simple tribute or a fond remembrance, it is a remarkable and full-throated elegy, a work of art that is full of life."

But the director Thomas Piper, whose credits include another documentary that deals with the High Line and a film about the artist Sol LeWitt, never finds a way to convey the excitement of his subject’s innovations. Viewers may pay more attention to their surroundings the next time they walk the High Line, but that would be a better use of their time."

These days, it seems, the phrase is often used ironically. It’s all about the accumulation of wealth and a sybaritic lifestyle. There’s no spiritual dimension, no sense of genuine civic aspiration.Within those cynically defined contemporary parameters, Youngblood Priest (Trevor Jackson, dressed to the nines and sporting what one character derides as “Morris Day hair”) is doing well. He’s a major drug supplier in bling-driven Atlanta. He has two live-in girlfriends, the quietly sophisticated Georgia (Lex Scott Davis) and the younger, flintier Cynthia (Andrea Londo). He’s got a beautiful house and a beautiful car, commands respect, and presides over an uneasy peace with Snow Patrol, a competing drug gang that wears all white.That peace starts fragmenting early in the picture, outside a nightclub, where an indolently truculent Snow Patrol member, Juju (Kaalan Rashad Walker), takes a shot at Priest and instead hits a bystander. Priest plays good guy by handing the victim’s friends a wad of cash and giving them the name of the best local trauma center.VideoDirector X narrates a sequence from the film featuring Trevor Jackson and Michael Kenneth Williams.Published OnJune 12, 2018CreditCreditQuantrell D. Colbert/Columbia PicturesThe close call and its concurrent threat of a gang war compel Priest to take stock. He confides to a lieutenant, Eddie (Jason Mitchell), that he wants out. Pulling into his driveway, he confides to the audience, in voice-over, that he believes “no car ever outran fate.”This film, directed by Director X from a script by Alex Tse, is a remake of the 1972 picture directed by Gordon Parks Jr. (whose father had made “Shaft” a year before). The first film — titled “Super Fly” (two words instead of one) — was a low-budget affair with a gritty look and a claustrophobic feel. As Priest, Ron O’Neal had a charisma and enigmatic elegance that stood out in the Harlem back rooms and alleys where he did his business. The moral conundrum of drug dealing among African-Americans was addressed mostly by Curtis Mayfield’s superb soundtrack, which functioned as a kind of Greek chorus.This “Superfly” has original songs by the hip-hop artist Future, who’s also a producer of the film. But they’re not particularly distinctive; perhaps that’s why a couple of Mayfield songs are brought back to serve here. And indeed, when they pop up, they infuse the movie with fresh rhythm.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJune 4, 2018Director X has a larger budget and a more expansive milieu to deal with here. He seems almost as influenced by Brian De Palma’s “Scarface” (itself a remake) as by the original “Super Fly.” Witness the bright oranges and subsequent neon colors in the movie’s opening scene: a tracking shot of an underground nightclub, depicting Priest on a mission to collect money owed.Once Priest decides to pursue his “last score,” he seeks help from his mentor in crime, Scatter, played by an avuncular but cautiously sinister Michael Kenneth Williams. On the one hand, it’s a clever idea to have the pair negotiate drug supplies while sparring in Scatter’s martial-arts gym; on the other, the cleverness becomes beside the point because Director X can’t manage to make both the action and the dialogue work in tandem.Refused by Scatter, Priest has to pitch himself to a deadly Mexican cartel manager played by Esai Morales. Priest manages to get to terms with him just before some henchmen are going to throw him from a private jet. As Mayfield’s “Pusherman” plays, Priest’s drugs are seen hitting Birmingham, Ala.; Nashville; Miami; and Houston. The money rolls in, and soon a couple of corrupt white cops are making aggressive requests to dip their beaks.ImageAndrea Londo in “Superfly.”CreditQuantrell D. Colbert/Columbia PicturesThe roomier scenario of this remake has the potential to yield a decent thriller, but “Superfly” too often prioritizes showy sequences for dubious reasons. One lengthy sex-in-the-shower scene between the characters played by Mr. Jackson, Ms. Londo and Ms. Davis has a nearly risible box-checking quality.On “Freddie’s Dead,” a song on the 1972 soundtrack album (it’s not sung in the film itself), Mayfield calls out “Another junkie plan/Pushing dope for the Man,” vocalizing in a tone that the critic Greil Marcus (in his great book “Mystery Train”) called “incredulous and disgusted.”“The Man” so trenchantly invoked by Mayfield was incarnated in the earlier film by a white police superintendent who wants Priest as his puppet. That character was a stand-in for white oppression, someone Priest finally contrives to walk away from, clean. But in this film’s 21st-century Atlanta, “The Man” never really manifests. Greed and corruption are themselves the magnetic fields that pull together would-be players — white, Latino and African-American.Given human nature, the alliances and affinities are almost always short term, of course. Which isn’t to say that the film lacks for racial consciousness. “Superfly” saves its most righteous physical violence for its finale, and it’s a sequence that will probably enrage anyone who’s ever uttered the phrase “Blue Lives Matter.” The entire denouement has a nice satirical sting, pushed along by the rapper and songwriter Big Boi’s droll turn as an incumbent mayor hungry for re-election. He becomes a potent weapon in Priest’s score settling."

What “Hereditary” shares with “Get Out” — apart from a house full of white people behaving strangely — is an ambitious energy, a sense that the creaky old machinery of horror can be adapted to new and exciting uses.VideoThe director Ari Aster narrates a scene from his horror film.Published OnJune 7, 2018CreditCreditA24The film, Mr. Aster’s debut feature, is engaging, unsettling and unpredictable, generating a mood of anxious fascination punctuated by frequent shocks and occasional nervous giggles. But I also found it a bit disappointing. Mr. Aster writes an impressive-looking check and succeeds in cashing it, but on close examination the payout turns out to be skimpier than anticipated, and drawn mostly on someone else’s account.On the other hand, the minute-to-minute experience of watching the movie, sometimes through your fingers, is an ordeal of the best kind. The scariest line is “mommy,” the most terrifying scenes take place when the whole family is together, and the sound most likely to make the person next to you shriek out loud is the click of a young girl’s tongue against the roof of her mouth.[ Have you seen “Hereditary?” Read about the ending here. ]The girl’s name is Charlie Graham, and she’s played by a remarkable young actress named Milly Shapiro. Charlie’s hobby is assembling makeshift toys out of peculiar objects, including the severed head of a bird she decapitates with a pair of classroom scissors. This seems like a creepy variation on the artwork that Charlie’s mother, Annie (Toni Collette), makes in the studio that occupies part of their spacious wood-frame house. Annie constructs dollhouse-like dioramas that are painstakingly detailed and that recreate, in miniature, scenes and places from her own life.VideoA look at films where the boogeyman just may be a loved one.Published OnJune 6, 2018CreditCreditA24Mr. Aster plays with scale, size, sound and perspective to maximize the audience’s disorientation. He’s not an orthodox scaremonger, sending his camera gliding down dark hallways in search of the usual ghouls. The first hour of “Hereditary” moves with excruciating slowness, alternating between scenes of eerie menace and moments of dark and dry domestic comedy.The movie starts with the offscreen death of Annie’s mother, Ellen. “It’s heartening to see so many strange new faces here,” Annie says at the funeral, before going on to describe a “secretive, suspicious” woman who was, to say the least, a difficult parent. Maybe something about Ellen accounts for her daughter’s jumpy demeanor and her odd ways of talking to her own children. She can be chilly, needy or brutally blunt, but neither Mr. Aster nor Ms. Collette overdoes her weirdness. Annie is an artist, after all, a complicated and emotionally volatile person almost by definition. Her husband, a shrink named Steve (Gabriel Byrne), gets along with her pretty well. Their son, Peter (Alex Wolff), can be moody and detached, but he’s a high school student.Maybe this family isn’t scary at all. Maybe they’re just interesting, like characters in the Wes Anderson movie this one sometimes resembles, both in its deadpan humor and in its attention to architectural space and interior decoration.ImageMilly Shapiro and Alex Wolff in “Hereditary.”CreditReid Chavis/A24When horrible things start to happen, we don’t know what they mean, but we are prodded to suppose that they must mean something. What are those strange words that appear on the walls of the Graham house, and also inside the tiny rooms Annie builds within it? Why do the Grahams have a treehouse? Who desecrated Ellen’s grave? Is Ann Dowd going to freak us out again, as she has in “The Leftovers” and “The Handmaid’s Tale”?Well, of course. Long before the big revelations of the hectic, hair-raising climax, you may suspect that Ms. Dowd, playing a woman named Joan who befriends Annie in a support group, is playing a part roughly analogous to Ruth Gordon’s in “Rosemary’s Baby.” Like that film — and like “The Exorcist,” too — “Hereditary” draws on a deep, dark well of ambivalent maternal feeling and blurs the boundary between mental and supernatural disturbance. Ms. Collette, at once vulnerable and volcanic, solicits our sympathy even as we start to wonder if she might be the real monster.“Hereditary” is a terrifically absorbing puzzle until the moment you solve it, when its disparate elements coalesce into a dispiritingly familiar picture. The ending is kind of a reverse “Babadook.” The ingenuity of “The Babadook” was that it behaved like a well-executed conventional horror movie, only to reveal startling emotional resonance and psychological depths right at the end. Mr. Aster moves in the opposite direction, composing a rich and strange portrait of souls in distress and then swapping it for a picture we’ve seen before. Better the devil you know, I guess."

A return to Brooklyn for the filmmaker turned television director Jim McKay — whose terrific Crown Heights coming-of-age movie “Our Song” opened in 2001 — the film doesn’t shy from showing its range of influences or its multiculturalism. The credits and subtitles are in English and Spanish. The nonprofessional cast members are as compelling as any pros.Set over the course of slightly more than a week in the summer of 2016 (when it was shot), “En el Séptimo Día” (“On the Seventh Day”) revolves around José (Fernando Cardona), the captain of a Sunset Park soccer team. Like his fellow players, José is an undocumented immigrant. But after the team qualifies for the finals, José learns that Steve (Christopher Gabriel Núñez), his boss at a Mexican restaurant, needs him to work the Sunday of the game. Inconveniently, José is both the best player on the team and Steve’s best bicycle deliveryman.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 28, 2018From a practical perspective, José’s choice isn’t much of a choice. He can’t lose his job for a game, and besides, he likes the work, despite condescending customers, including an office worker who can’t even be bothered to be there when his order arrives. We eventually learn that José also has a pregnant wife in Mexico. She is peripheral to his daily routine and crowded living arrangement, which Mr. McKay captures in vivid but uninflected detail, though critical to his reasoning.The film turns less on José’s decision than on what that decision says about him. At once a work of social realism and a parable (as its biblical title suggests), the movie subtly advocates for the virtues of camaraderie, solidarity, and sticking up for yourself and your friends. José hesitates to reveal to Steve why he doesn’t want to work on Sunday; he also worries about telling his teammates he can’t play, although he repeatedly hints to them that they may need two men to replace Artemio (Genoel Ramírez), who is injured at the start of the film.Improbably, José’s teammates contrive a way for him to be in two places at once. The climactic sequence — simple in concept but tensely staged, foregrounding the ticktock of time that’s present from the opening minutes — may leave you as breathless as it leaves José. It’s a bit of movie magic, and “En el Séptimo Día” is too smart to pretend it will solve everything."

In “Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist,” the director Lorna Tucker shrewdly lets her subject, the British designer Vivienne Westwood, profess resistance to this movie early. “I think what you’ll have to let me do,” Ms. Westwood says right as it opens, “is just let me talk, just get it over with.” Wearing an indigo blue dress while posing and pouting on a mauve velvet armchair, she sighs. “I will get into it, but it’s so boring.”There are many words that you can use to describe Ms. Westwood (born 1941), an early punk rock tastemaker and merchandizer turned global couture brand. Boring certainly is not one of them. And as the movie jumps from past to present, from street to palace, from the Sex Pistols to Queen Elizabeth II, Ms. Westwood’s claim sounds increasingly strange and borderline ridiculous. It also starts to seem like a schtick, and a familiar one. Consider that the 2014 book “Vivienne Westwood,” a memoir that she wrote with Ian Kelly, opens on a similarly, equally dubious note of resistance: “Don’t talk to me now, Ian, I’m really, really busy.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 28, 2018Maybe Ms. Westwood was just being a punk and embracing the anarchic ethos with which she has long been identified. The documentary revisits some of that movement’s early history, its music and its stylized belligerence, though there’s only so much it can cram into 80 minutes as it follows Ms. Westwood across the decades and through her manifold transformations. In 1965, she met Malcolm McLaren, when he was an art student and she was a young single mother. They became a couple and had a son, Joe Corré, who went on to help found the lingerie company Agent Provocateur and appears in the movie as one of its most insidery observers.By 1971, Ms. Westwood and Mr. McLaren were selling records, clothes and ephemera in a store, Let It Rock, on King’s Road in London. It went through various iterations, as did its creators. Enter the Sex Pistols, controversy, success, failure and more success, a trajectory that Ms. Tucker entertainingly illustrates with a rush of talking heads and colorful archival material. After selling punk, Ms. Westwood turned to fashion. She was laughed at, and she laughed back, all the way to Lloyds. In 1980s, her company almost went bankrupt. In 1992, the queen gave Ms. Westwood the Order of the British Empire. She wore a smart hat, a gorgeous skirt suit and no panties.Ms. Westwood embraced high fashion boldly, at times thrillingly, often by pilfering and deconstructing British history. Mr. McLaren, she says, grew jealous. She soon outran him, and would outlast him. (He died in 2010.) “I got intellectually bored with Malcolm,” Ms. Westwood says, a shattering post-mortem. She can be as off-putting and frustrating as she is fascinating. She asserts that “we invented punk” (tell it to Patti Smith, Richard Hell, etc.) but brushes past the Sex Pistols. She may understandably want to keep the focus on her own legacy, which remains tethered to a past that gives the movie its funniest, most sly bit: a white-gloved museum curator contextualizing a Westwood-McLaren shirt festooned with a swastika, straitjacket clasps and Sex Pistols lyrics.As this portrait takes shape, Ms. Westwood — now a Dame — is often seen working, though much of the actual designing is now done by her husband, Andreas Kronthaler. (These days, she’s more keen on environmental activism.) Mr. Kronthaler seems happy to remain in her shadow — maybe. Much remains unexplained and underexplored, including her relationship with her company’s chief executive, Carlo D’Amario, whom she seems to criticize. In a  blog post this week, Ms. Westwood wrote, “For the latter half of my career in fashion I’ve hated my company.” So who knows? In the memoir, Mr. Kelly explained that “Setting the record straight has proved to be an elusive task, even for her, and she was there.” Ms. Tucker certainly deserves credit for trying."

Toggling between past and present, “The Valley” is grim going in both timelines. Was it the chronic pressure from her parents (and perhaps from the expectations facing first-generation Indian-Americans)? Did Maya have undiagnosed depression? How about the frat party the night before her death — could that have had something to do with it?In raising would-be solutions to the mystery, “The Valley” saves its most trivializing red herring — the one that sends Neal to a gun shop, where he rails against a mandatory waiting period — for its final half-hour. But in a sense, these Rosebuds are just a way of stalling for time. It’s clear early on that the movie’s subject, no less reductive as an explanation for suicide, is Neal’s inability to communicate with Maya.In her feature writing-directing debut, Saila Kariat shows better technical instincts than dramatic ones. (Lengthy shots that glide through a Christmas party and through an office are impressively staged, if pointless.) As an awareness tool, “The Valley” feels simple-minded. As a drama, it feels exploitative."

Not as such.At a conference, the American chef Dan Barber praises Mr. Ducasse for his advocacy of farm-to-table and its various forms, crowing, “He is why we are serving waste-fed pig on our menu and charging what we charge for it.” There’s a whole other movie somewhere in that statement, a more provocative one. But the movie depicts Mr. Ducasse’s sweeping streak — he prepares food for the homeless in Brazil and concocts a deluxe restaurant at Versailles — competently if not brilliantly.A screening of the film accompanied by a tasting menu afterward, though — that would be something."

But the majority of the filmmakers included here are directors for hire whose careers depend on agents and executives considering them for open jobs in television and movies. In talking-head interviews, these women recount their frustrations — meetings with condescending executives who hire to fulfill diversity quotas, insulting confrontations with male crew members and instances of sexual harassment.The stories that Ms. Adrion elicits may be infuriatingly recognizable to women who work in many fields. But if there is a missing element in her analysis, it is the effect that sexism has on these women’s artistry, not only their livelihoods. Although she has assembled a cohort of distinctive artists from Kasi Lemmons (“Eve’s Bayou”) to Miranda July (“Me and You and Everyone We Know”), and though each subject professes a desire to make personal films, Ms. Adrion only sparingly asks about their style, subject matter, passions and influences.As a result, “Half the Picture” becomes an unwitting example of the impossible bind facing women filmmakers. Whether female artists submit to a rigged system or fight against it, the energy they expend on the struggle tugs them away from dreaming and creating. They’re pushed to contend with discrimination and demographics even as the sounds, colors, lights, stories and private politics that drive their cinematic visions go unacknowledged — asked to justify the value of an artistic perspective they are not allowed to fully embody."

Foreign workers make up a large majority of the population yet, by law, many are confined to isolated camps.To help the men fight loneliness (and to give Qatar valuable PR amid accusations of abuses) a committee organized the competition of the title, and 24 companies fielded teams.

On the other hand, you might simply be weary of wincing at the visions of filmmakers (in this case, Christina Choe) intent on rubbing our noses in lives ungraced by a single second of loveliness or joy.Played by Andrea Riseborough, Nancy is a profoundly disturbed woman in her 30s who lives with her sickly, nagging mother (Ann Dowd) in a depressingly drab house. She’s also a pathological liar whose frozen affect borders on shellshocked and whose writing aspirations serve mainly to deceive unwitting readers of her blog. One of these is a bereaved father (John Leguizamo), for whose benefit she feigns pregnancy and fabricates an experiential intimacy. What she actually believes, or feels, or wants is unclear; but when she presents herself as the long-missing daughter of a comfortably-off older couple (beautifully portrayed by J. Smith-Cameron and Steve Buscemi), the movie’s emotional stakes rise precipitously.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 28, 2018Our fears, though, are all for the anxious couple, whose genuine decency and vulnerability pierce the movie’s artifice and shame Nancy’s posturing. Yet there’s bravery in Ms. Choe’s insistence on her remaining an enigma; wrapped in Zoë White’s bleak cinematography, Nancy is so closed off we can’t get a handle on her. What’s left is a strange, sour tale that’s neither origin mystery nor journey of self-discovery, but a vexing gesture toward damage and delusion that never permits us to peek under its broken heroine’s hood."

One of these men of the cloth is a fictional character, Ernst Toller, the anguished pastor (played by Ethan Hawke) who ministers to a dwindling flock in Paul Schrader’s “First Reformed.” The other is a real person: Fred Rogers, a graduate of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary whose millions of congregants assembled in front of their parents’ television sets from the late 1960s until the early years of this century, absorbing his benign and friendly secular wisdom.To them — to us — he was always and only Mister Rogers. The custom of this publication is to strip the dead of their honorifics (he died in 2003), but that feels almost blasphemous here. The “mister” signified that this man was a grown-up, that the friendship he offered his young fans wasn’t about condescending to us or compensating for his own lost youth. As he greeted us, he shed his suit jacket for a cardigan and traded his loafers for sneakers. But his tie stayed knotted, and his warmth carried an aura of gentle formality. He was not shy about being a role model or a benevolent authority figure. On the contrary, he took the responsibilities of adulthood seriously. He might have been the last of his kind.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 28, 2018A curious melancholy pervades “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” Morgan Neville’s moving and illuminating new documentary. A lump might gather in your throat during the opening titles and dissolve into sniffles and sobs as the final credits roll. Some of this can be ascribed to nostalgia. As a member of the charter generation of viewers — a toddler when “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” was first broadcast, in 1968 — I felt a bittersweet pang on revisiting the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, a place inhabited mainly by Mister Rogers’s puppet alter egos. It was delightful to see pictures of the low-budget set in the studios of WQED-TV in Pittsburgh, where the show started out, and to hear the reminiscences of members of the cast and crew.The movie doesn’t dig too deep into its subject’s personal life. I remember wondering if there was a Mrs. Rogers. Her name is Joanne, and she and Fred raised two sons, John and James. They are interviewed on camera, adding detail and texture to the portrait of their husband and father. But not much is said about his childhood or his parents, though there is some mention of bullying and other early hardship. Mr. Neville, whose other films include “20 Feet From Stardom” and “The Best of Enemies” (directed with Robert Gordon) is not interested in psychological sleuthing. Rather than trying to unlock offscreen secrets, he sets out to assess the meaning and impact of an onscreen persona.It is that emphasis — the earnest, critical attention to the public Mister Rogers and his legacy — that makes “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” feel like such a gift. Like Tom Junod’s great 1998 Esquire profile — the inspiration for a Mister Rogers biopic with Tom Hanks set for next year — this movie is at once unapologetically admiring and intellectually rigorous. (Mr. Junod shows up to add a few new insights and anecdotes.) It begins with an old clip of Fred Rogers, a trained composer, at the piano, explaining his approach to communicating with children by way of the musical concept of modulation. Some changes of key, he says, are easy enough to manage, while others are trickier. And so it is with feelings.Several generations of American kids learned letters and numbers from “Sesame Street,” phonics from “The Electric Company,” and civics and grammar from “Schoolhouse Rock!” What Mister Rogers tried to teach us — how to navigate “some of the more difficult modulations” in everyday life — might now be classified as emotional literacy. He acknowledged that anger, fear and other kinds of hurt are part of the human repertoire and that children need to learn to speak honestly about those feelings, and to trust the people they share them with.ImageRogers with François Clemmons from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”CreditJohn Beale/Focus FeaturesThere was always an ethical — and, at times, a political — dimension to his calm, compassionate pedagogy. Early episodes of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” tackled political violence and racial discrimination, and he could be a fierce critic of the commercial popular culture he deemed cruel, degrading or shallow. Part of the experience of growing up in his era was rebelling against his influence, and Mr. Neville gives some room to the satirists who pushed back against what could seem like a limiting and tyrannical niceness.A few right-wing cable-news voices are also heard taking shots at Mister Rogers’s belief in the specialness of everyone, which they take as wishy-washy, character-sapping progressivism rather than a straightforward gloss on basic Christian teaching. What such critics see as a license for solipsism was in truth a call to recognize and respect the dignity of others.A source of Mister Rogers’s charisma was his old-style conservatism. The Neighborhood of Make-Believe was a monarchy. The adjacent, “real” neighborhood, where he hung up his coat, fed his fish and chatted with Mr. McFeely and Officer Clemmons, was a utopian projection of the midcentury American small town, its problems not whitewashed but worked out, patiently and conscientiously, from one day to the next.Mister Rogers’s demeanor balanced openness with reserve, curiosity with tact. The most radical thing about him was his unwavering commitment to the value of kindness in the face of the world that could seem intent on devising new ways to be mean. “Let’s make the most of this beautiful day,” he would sing at the start of each episode. He made it sound so simple, but also as if he knew just how hard it could be."

Stuffed with talented, beautiful women playing naughty, this is the latest addition to the cycle that was once about an improbably suave thief, Danny Ocean (George Clooney), and his mostly male band of charming accomplices. Danny is now out of the picture, and Sandra Bullock has stepped in to play his sister, Debbie Ocean, who’s soon overseeing her own con with a knowing smile and the usual suspects, including a partner in crime, a hacker, a pickpocket and a distraction, played with fizz and delectable timing by Anne Hathaway.Like every sequel, the whole thing is familiar yet different enough. It opens much like “Ocean’s Eleven,” Steven Soderbergh’s 2001 series relaunch, with Debbie finishing a prison stretch and strolling into freedom in heels, camera-ready makeup and the kind of bed-head hair that takes a village of Vidal Sassoons. (Danny swanned out in a tux, equally buffed to a high sheen.) After flaunting her skills — she liberates a suitcase from its owner and demonstrates how to book into a fancy hotel gratis — Debbie winds the story’s clockwork, setting it whirring. She reaches out to her bestie, Lou (Cate Blanchett), an iteration on Brad Pitt’s old “Ocean’s” wingman — and we’re off.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 28, 2018CreditCreditBarry Wetcher/Warner Bros.The 2001 “Ocean’s” was a redo of a 1960 heist film with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin set in Vegas, amid the neon and ring-a-ding nonsense. It’s a lead soap bubble of a movie, a nostalgia item that’s memorable only for its Rat Pack stars, who seemed to have made it between martinis and rounds of golf. It’s best enjoyed as a relic of Playboy-era masculinity, with Angie Dickinson and assorted disposable women floating in and out like moths. Mr. Soderbergh’s remake, as well as his two follow-ups, greatly improved on the original and added a few substantive female characters. The new movie changes things up with its all-female gang that includes Mindy Kaling and an underused Rihanna.Plenty of movies have all or nearly all-male casts, including war and combat films, and manly teams have long been called to duty in heist stories and impossible missions à la “Dirty Dozen.” Women sometimes play a role in these stories (if only as a photo tucked in a G.I.’s helmet), but often remain sidelined or absent. There have also been all-female movies, of course, including the 1939 comedy “The Women,” in which men, though physically absent, remain the subject of obsessive female interest. Men often hover in these female-dominated realms, perhaps because the men (and women) who make these movies can’t imagine taking them out of the picture.That’s the case in “Ocean’s 8,” which includes an irritating subplot involving a very bad former lover. It’s needless narrative filler; worse, it dilutes the purity of the women’s work, their screen mission as it were. Part of the appeal of the “Ocean’s” movies is that their characters are excellent at their jobs, at slipping watches off wrists, cash out of vaults and all the irresistible, disreputable rest. Like the earlier movies, this one hews to the series doctrine that larceny is America’s favorite pastime. Here, as before, theft is a sexy calling and a near obligation, a service that the beautiful and the cool provide as they steal from the greedier, stupider and far less deserving.ImageFrom left, Ms. Paulson, Ms. Bullock and Rihanna.CreditBarry Wetcher/Warner Bros.The bad ex angle isn’t worked too hard or too long, but it means that even when women are running a multimillion-dollar con they have to make room for guy troubles, which is a drag. Most of the heists in the “Ocean’s” series involve Vegas casinos; the booty here is a Cartier chandelier of a necklace that’s being taken out of the vault for the Met Gala. Hence the peekaboo shots of the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, as well as of boldface names (Serena Williams, Katie Holmes) and swoony close-ups of gowns and gems. A lot of this is fun to watch but would have been more breezily enjoyable if the movie played as lightly (and seriously) with gender as much as it does with genre.Directed by Gary Ross, who machined the script together with Olivia Milch (and the uncredited help of anyone who’s ever written a caper flick), the movie goes down relatively easy despite these nits. At some point between the first and second hours, though, you may find yourself wishing that Mr. Soderbergh — a producer here — had also directed “Ocean’s 8.” Its cast aside, the movie sounds and narratively unwinds like the previous installments, but without the same easy snap or visual allure. As a director, Mr. Soderbergh doesn’t throw the camera around, but one of the pleasures of his movies is a commitment to beauty as a cinematic end. Here, the actresses carry that burden.The relaxed Ms. Bullock seems awfully pleased to be on call, but she never takes full possession of the role of Debbie Ocean, who’s meant to be satiny smooth. Part of what makes Sandra Bullock Sandra Bullock is seeing her characters sweat — no matter how shrewd or innocent, bungling or smooth — whether she’s doing hard labor or merely dewy from the effort of being alive. She’s an ace Everywoman, the star with that ineluctable something who also feels like best-friend material, the sort you can weep, laugh and close the bar down with, and who makes it easy to wake up the next morning feeling faintly optimistic about the new day.On backup, Ms. Blanchett keeps her performance low-key and cool, wrapping her character in just enough mystery to keep you transfixed. (The costume department does its share with animal prints and biker wear.) The rest of the women — Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson and Awkwafina — have one or two moments, but the movie is more or less the Sandy and Cate show until Ms. Hathaway fires up her smile and turns the part of a clichéd Hollywood female narcissist into a disquisition on performative femininity. It’s a role that presumably all the women in “Ocean’s 8” know well but that only Ms. Hathaway gets to turn into blissful, slyly political comedy gold."

Now in their 40s, Mr. Knoxville and Chris Pontius, the troupe’s other returning member, have endured so much above- and below-the-belt trauma that it’s only natural for them to want to (mostly) coast through a lame father-daughter bonding plot. But neither is it much fun to see them upstaged by a beer-guzzling bear.We’re not really watching to see whether Mr. Knoxville’s character, D.C., will take his daughter (Eleanor Worthington-Cox) to a Clash concert, or whether a corporate weasel (Dan Bakkedahl) will acquire the decrepit amusement park that D.C. owns and elects to make more dangerous to raise cash.The inspiration for the setting is New Jersey’s defunct Action Park, the subject of news reports of drownings and other deaths. (Mr. Pontius’s jobs in the movie include lifeguard; his attitude is “let God sort ’em out.”) It’s roughly 1979, and this is framed as a halcyon era when injured revelers wouldn’t run to reporters or lawyers. There’s no such risk with “Action Point”; only laugh-deprived moviegoers could sue."

A sustaining pleasure of this alluring subgenre, of course, is the spectacle of mostly male, mostly naked bodies miraculously sliding over and through the water. In “Breath,” the narrator recalls that on seeing surfers when he was young he thought: “Never had I seen men do something so beautiful, so pointless and elegant, as if dancing on water was the best and brightest thing a man could do.” So there’s that, too.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 21, 2018The narrator, Pikelet, is voiced as an adult by the Australian writer Tim Winton, who wrote the novel on which this quiet, quietly elegiac movie is based. Directed by the actor Simon Baker, making his feature debut, “Breath” centers on Pikelet (Samson Coulter), a gangly 13-year-old whose Modigliani beauty surfaces as he surfs, learns and matures into a weathered 16-year-old soul. When not in school, Pikelet spends much of his time with his reckless friend, Loonie (Ben Spence), biking around their West Australian hometown, a place where nothing seems to happen even when everything does.“Breath,” set in the 1970s, tells an appealing, familiar coming-of-age tale about a boy and his friend who, as innocence gives way to prickly adult complication, take divergent paths. When the movie opens, Pikelet and Loonie are like one, swimming underwater and smiling at each other as if into a mirror, the fragmented images of their pale, slender limbs making it difficult, at times, to see where one boy ends and the other begins. Surfing opens their world and minds. But it also distinguishes them, especially once their drifty, uneventful existence is shaken up by a famous surfer, Sando (Mr. Baker), who lives in bucolic bohemian isolation outside of town with his wife, Eva (Elizabeth Debicki), and their dog. The dog is far friendlier than the wife, at least at first.Sando soon becomes Pikelet and Loonie’s surf guru, their guide in the water and beyond. Initially, his deeds and words are obvious, solicitous and spiked with gentle teasing. He gives the boys wet suits, lets them stash their boards at his house and drives them to secret spots where perfect waves await. Before long, amid the swells and landscape beauty shots, Sando is dropping gnomic wisdom that announces the story’s metaphysical ambitions and reminds you that lamas come on land and on sea. “You don’t need to prove anything, mate, you were there” he tells Pikelet and Loonie after initiating them into the Way of the Wave. “It’s not about us, it’s about you, your moment with the sea.”ImageMr. Spence, left, and Mr. Coulter play friends whose world is opened up by surfing.CreditDavid Dare Parker/FilmRisePikelet and Loonie take these pronouncements very seriously, like the wide-eyed initiates they are, and so does the movie, which could have detached a little and laughed a bit more. Sando is the groovy dude in paradise, so there’s plenty to love about his scene, though plenty that gives pause, too. He is an adult who likes to hang out with kids, for one, a habit that only Eva skeptically questions as she wafts about in a cloud of pot smoke and bad vibes. Eva is the Bummer Wife, the unhappy female fly in the ointment. And while she isn’t wrong about her husband, the movie takes a long time to give her a voice, one that proves stranger, more contradictory and more difficult than the movie over all.Mr. Baker does nice work with the actors — his open-faced young leads are sincere, appealing, believable — and there’s a lot to like about “Breath,” including its attention to natural beauty and to how surfing can become a bridge to that splendor. The surfing scenes are unexpectedly entrancing, partly because of the water’s hypnotic pull, which visually draws you in even before Pikelet scrambles on his board. One of Mr. Baker’s smart choices, by design, season or an accident of the weather, is that the world he has captured looks very far from the sun-drenched endless summers of movie-made California. Here, the sky often looks colorless and the water strikingly, formidably gray.Perhaps out of loyalty to his source material, Mr. Baker at times overstates the obvious; when the sun does shine on the water, it can shoot down like a holy ray, and there is a lot of panting and gasping both on and off the board. His efforts to elevate the quotidian — the exultation of the ordinary that emerges as the story’s moral — can feel heavy-handed, and there’s too much of Pikelet smiling at his doting mother and dashing past his loving father doing something humble yet meaningful. Sando represents a magnetic masculine ideal, but he is also a lesson that Pikelet needs to learn because, as the movie reminds us (as if we needed reminding), boys become men but not necessarily adults."

She plots a course to Hawaii and reluctantly sets aside her vegetarianism to catch a fish and eat it raw. Days turn into weeks.Meanwhile, in the comfort of our seats, viewers muse about what we would do in a similar situation. True to its genre, “Adrift” dispenses both the terror of extreme conditions and the comfort of a competent response. Tami is both ordinary and extraordinary.The film is a notch below average. It lacks the austere grandeur of “All Is Lost,” the spiritual hoo-ha and digital gee-whizzery of “Life of Pi” and the technological bravura of “Gravity,” which it most resembles in terms of plot and mood. The chronological back-and-forth diffuses the dread and suspense — the feeling of desperate uncertainty implied by the title — that might have made for a more intense, more memorable yarn."

As their 4-year-old, Jake, nears school age, they talk the talk about wanting to support public education, but also about wanting the best for their smart kid.Jake is more than just smart. As Judy (Octavia Spencer), a family friend who also supervises Jake’s preschool, points out, he enjoys “gender-expansive play.” When Alex and Greg refuse to allow him to dress up as Rapunzel for Halloween, Jake does not respond well.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 23, 2018Directed by Silas Howard from a screenplay by Daniel Pearle, who adapted his own stage play, “A Kid Like Jake” is humane, compassionate and strangely detached, almost to the point of inconsequentiality. In Mr. Pearle’s play, Jake is kept offstage; here he’s played by the child actor Leo James Davis. He is often shot from behind, or heard more than seen. It’s probably difficult to get a child to credibly perform this role. The actor is present, but the character is absent. And this throws the movie off balance.The adults do well, though. Ms. Danes executes an impressive slow burn as her character’s tolerance and understanding are tested. Mr. Parsons’s character, a therapist, is deliberately unmacho. Greg’s fussiness has traces of Mr. Parsons’s most famous creation, the socially challenged Sheldon in “The Big Bang Theory.” At one point, Greg knocks urgently at the door of a colleague in his suite of offices; I half-expected him to say “Penny? Penny? Penny?”"

For Vincent Lindon, cast and bearded as the great man in this inert biopic from Jacques Doillon, that task entails gazing intently at statues, busts and naked models, looking gruff and serious, while the camera avoids close-ups of the detailing. Remember the artist; forget about the art.Critics at last year’s Cannes Film Festival received “Rodin” as if they had collectively taken a marble anvil to the head. If the movie plays marginally better now, it still lacks an arresting perspective on its subject. Employing an episodic, borderline shapeless structure, it subscribes to the kind of screenwriting shorthand that prompts bad guffaws.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 22, 2018“He’s coming to life,” Rodin’s lover and fellow sculptor Camille Claudel (Izïa Higelin) exclaims as her mentor shapes his latest triumph. “Soon you’ll know Balzac as well as if you’d spent years with him.”“Hello, Paul,” Rodin greets Cézanne.“No, Steichen, night,” Rodin tells the photographer Edward, referring to the best time to shoot the finished Balzac monument.In the battle-of-the-sexes byplay between Rodin and Claudel, who struggles to be taken seriously as a sculptor because of her gender, it is possible to glimpse traces of tougher films that Mr. Doillon has made. (“Raja,” from 2003, also dealt with a relationship imbalanced by age, wealth and colonial dynamics.) But signs of life are few. A desaturated palette makes “Rodin” as monotonous to look at as it is to endure."

The vanishing pleasures of Polaroids and video stores; the smarting efficiency of hot-wax defuzzing over newfangled laser treatments; the carefree thrill of freeloading over regular rent payments — these are what preoccupy the quirky slackers who knock about its Austin, Tex., locations.At their hub is Zoe (Noël Wells), pushing 30 and brightly shouldering the dual burden of a dying business and imminent eviction. Her House of Wax, where she performs stem-to-stern Brazilians — their yelping recipients inelegantly captured via “Call the Midwife”-style camera angles — is threatened by a new laser-treatment salon down the road. At the same time, the land rent for the trailer where she lives is overdue. Both crises are placed on hold while she diverts herself by taking keepsake Polaroids of her parade of one-night stands.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 30, 2018As the writer and director, Theresa Bennett, sympathizes with her hapless heroine, the script surrounds her with equally directionless, intimacy-challenged souls. There’s a best friend (the excellent Carly Chaikin) whose raunchiest lingerie can’t distract her conservative fiancé from a recording of the 2000 Republican Convention. And there’s a possible love interest in Paul (Josh Radnor), a fellow sad sack whose beloved video emporium is on the ropes and whose brittle, bossy wife (Aya Cash) would rather hire a male prostitute than conjugally indulge her husband. No wonder their youngest child believes himself a dog: his father is regularly treated like one.Depending on your tolerance for adults stalled in adolescence, “Social Animals” (not to be confused with Jonathan Ignatius Green’s identically named documentary) is mildly entertaining and at times maddeningly cutesy. Wearing little-girl dresses and short-shorts, Ms. Wells, who’s now 31, appears barely old enough to legally purchase alcohol. For me, at least, this gives her scenes with Mr. Radnor — whose rumpled, nonthreatening amiability served him well as a high-school drama coach in the recently canceled television show “Rise” — a distracting awkwardness.Even so, the lack of chemistry between the two leads is less damaging than Ms. Bennett’s inability to commit to a tone. When you define characters almost exclusively by their sexual frustrations and dysfunctions (and literally introduce them with cute line drawings illustrating their preferred bonking positions), you can’t waver between empathy and cruelty. And absent the requisite hilarity, this single-issue tactic quickly becomes tedious, leaving you with a limp sex comedy that feels as cinematically played out as the dusty charm of Austin itself."

Eight miles from the airport in Medellín, the charter craft crashed in the nearby mountains; all but six of the 77 passengers died. The team itself lost 19 players.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 22, 2018“Nossa Chape,” a title that translates as “Our Team,” begins with a sketch of the small city of Chapecó, billing it as a place of “trailblazers and warriors.” The implication is that if there’s a people who can rebuild after a tragedy, it’s the city’s residents.This documentary, which was directed by the brothers Jeff Zimbalist and Michael Zimbalist (who made the 2016 fictional biopic “Pelé: Birth of a Legend”; Julian Duque is credited as their co-director here) shows that, in real life, comebacks rarely work out as they do in the movies. Upon the club’s return, it quickly racks up a losing record. A couple of the deceased players’ widows sue for compensation. While the new manager, Plínio Nês, and the new coach, Vagner Mancini, wear their optimism on their sleeves, they cannot replicate the values that animated the old team. Wins do not come, and the fans become spiteful.As the team struggles, a shocking revelation about the cause of the plane crash is revealed. When the players finally do begin to improve, there’s a creeping sense that Chapecoense doesn’t have the same heart. The Zimbalists do show how the team finds its way again — largely by installing leadership that understands its ethos. But the movie the directors have made doesn’t have the passion that its subjects do."

Mr. Lad is certainly right about the hodgepodge part (he claims that an area on your left arm contains your mother’s pulse, which he can read and analyze), but quite off base when he asserts: “This is a science.”Mr. Lad employs “the ancient medical practice” of ayurveda and “The Doctor From India,” a fawning documentary, is happy to promote his beliefs unquestioned. He’s called a psychic, a yogi and more by his ardent followers.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 21, 2018What he doesn’t have is a license to practice medicine in the United States, where he lives part-time, and the director, Jeremy Frindel, does little to outline Mr. Lad’s qualifications beyond some references to his training at an ayurveda school in India. No competing viewpoints are heard on Mr. Lad’s ideas; no evidence of ayurveda’s cures is supplied; and no studies, peer-reviewed or otherwise, are offered on Mr. Lad’s vaguely worded declarations. Deepak Chopra, however, appears onscreen to give his blessing.It’s hard to argue with Mr. Lad’s call for healthy diets and reduced stress. And his pleas for people to live in harmony with nature sound sensible (even when you can barely hear the soft-spoken man over the intrusive score). Indeed, Mr. Lad praises Western medicine — he had wanted to attend a conventional medical school but didn’t have the grades.Yet ambiguous claims involving spirituality and a sort of interpersonal energy transference are unsupported, and there’s an underlying implication that doubters are just spoilsports. That’s perhaps the most misguided part of this film: To seek proof is distinctly human, and, in this case, a dose of skepticism is surely healthy."

But don’t tell that to our hero Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green).In his garage, a space apparently not affected by the design of the rest of his future-world smart house, he tools with vintage gas-guzzling beauties to the light of a Budweiser neon sign, while listening to Howlin’ Wolf’s “Smokestack Lightning.” Grey just wasn’t made for these times. But soon he will be.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 22, 2018After delivering a refurbished car to the whacked-out digital mogul Eron Keen (whose first name sounds a lot like Elon, and who is played by Harrison Gilbertson), Grey and his wife are waylaid by slime balls who kill her and severely disable him. Conveniently enough, Eron has developed a chip that cannot only make Grey walk again, but also improve him in every other way. The chip, called “STEM,” also speaks to Grey, in a voice similar to that of HAL in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”“Upgrade” is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the “but dumb” category. That is, it’s kind of like “RoboCop,” but dumb, and also like “Ex Machina,” but dumb. In this respect the movie manages to be pretty funny; and the grisliness of the action, while in a sense entirely deplorable, adds to the kicks. As do the plot twists, which are satisfying in a — you guessed it — dumb way.Poor Mr. Marshall-Green very gamely tries to simulate a robotic posture during the action sequences (when STEM takes over him entirely, Grey is an unstoppable killing machine), but he can’t help looking like a goofball."

A Vanity Fair article a few years later described the heist as one part “Ocean’s 11,” one part “Harold & Kumar,” which might raise your hopes for “American Animals,” a new movie that reconstructs the crime. But the film, written and directed by Bart Layton, can’t quite decide what it wants to be: a slick, speedy caper; a goofball comedy; or a commentary on the state of the American soul. It’s none of those — a tame and toothless creature that is neither fish nor fowl.Dispensing with the usual vague “based on a true story” smoke screen, “American Animals” claims to show the truth about what happened. The actual perpetrators show up as narrators, offering slightly different but essentially compatible versions of events with at least the partial wisdom of hindsight. Their presence adds a patina of documentary credibility. Their younger, more irresponsible selves are played by professional actors, who re-enact the hectic planning, frenzied execution and inevitable unraveling of the theft.The biggest prize is an exquisite first edition of John James Audubon’s “The Birds of America,” which catches the eye of Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan), an art student at Transylvania. He proposes stealing it, perhaps as a joke, to his friend Warren Lipka (Evan Peters), a University of Kentucky student with an impulsive, volatile temperament. The two are an interesting study in contrasts. Spencer is moody, cerebral and prone to bouts of caution and common sense. Warren, whose parents are divorcing and who is in danger of losing his athletic scholarship, is wilder, perhaps even to the point of instability.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 21, 2018The two of them nudge each other across the line that separates fantasy from felony. “What if?” gives way to “How,” and before long Warren is flying to Amsterdam to meet with potential buyers for the loot, and Spencer is sketching floor plans and escape routes. They enlist two more accomplices: Eric Borsuk (Jared Abrahamson), a tightly wound accounting student, and Chas Allen II (Blake Jenner), a brash young entrepreneur. The only person standing in their way is Betty Jean Gooch (Ann Dowd), the librarian who controls access to the special collections.The motives of the young men are something of a puzzle, as are those of the filmmakers. “American Animals” sometimes revels in their rebellious spirit and sometimes mocks their shallowness and lack of discipline. Though the thieves are dazzled by the prospect of easy money, they seem driven less by greed than by a vague grudge against the universe. Warren in particular sees the heist as an act of existential revolt against conformity, a chance to break out of the dreary destiny that seems to be the lot of young men oblivious to their own privileges.Interviews with their parents and glimpses of their noncriminal pursuits emphasize that these are nice kids. What that seems to mean, mostly, is that they are white and middle class, entitled to the benefit of every doubt even when they are showing their cruel, selfish or stupid sides. The movie doesn’t romanticize or judge them, but it also shies away from the kind of objective naturalism that would challenge viewers to think about what this story might mean. The action is carried along on jumpy, poppy editing rhythms and on-the-nose song cues. (“New York Groove,” for example, when the scene shifts briefly to New York.)Mr. Layton, making his fictional feature debut, is blessedly more competent than his characters, but there is something soulless and mechanical about “American Animals,” as if it had been made by a Martin Scorsese smartphone app and scored to a Spotify classic rock playlist. Like the robbery itself, it must have seemed like a good idea — a lark, a warning, a statement — at some point."

Accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Franco grew more prominent in the wake of that victory, and his Oscar hopes were derailed. (The actor denied the allegations but said he supported the right of women to speak out.)You might infer this is the reason Mr. Franco’s new “Future World,” which he stars in and directed with Bruce Thierry Cheung, avoided screening for critics. Perhaps not.Future World (2018 Movie) Official Trailer - James Franco, Milla Jovovich, Lucy LiuCreditCreditVideo by Lionsgate Movies“Future World” is a miserable, idiotic sci-fi trifle, threadbare in both the imaginative and production value categories. I’d say it looked like what Corky St. Clair of “Waiting for Guffman” would come up with if he had a mind to make a “Mad Max: Fury Road” knockoff, but that would be insulting to Corky St. Clair.Mr. Franco plays Warlord, a postapocalyptic villain he essays with relish that sometimes seems untoward, particularly in his hostile interactions with female characters. Warlord is trying to rule a female robot, Ash (Suki Waterhouse), who may find her “soul” courtesy of Jeffrey Wahlberg’s Prince. He in turn has left his Oasis to find medicine to cure his mom from the Red Fever.The script purports to be by Mr. Cheung, Jeremy Craig Cheung and Jay Davis, but as the plot description should indicate, there’s a good chance the three of them took turns copying it from a fifth grader’s composition booklet.This is a movie in which one character says, “I wish I could see a tree” while trees are actually visible in the shot. Yes, they’re out of focus, but come now. What’s most remarkable is that it took two directors to yield a work this turgid and inept."

Julianne Nicholson’s Beth is an ex-con whose struggles to find stability in her new civilian life are not helped by her fixation on gaining custody of her son. (Her child has long been in the care of her younger sister, who has not even let him know that Beth, whom he calls an aunt, is actually his mom.) Emma Roberts’s Jess is a young lawyer working for a public defender, her civic-mindedness inhibiting her from seeking better-paying law work and alienating her more materialistic-minded family.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 17, 2018The two catch glimpses of each other early on. Beth’s initial representative is Jess’s boss, a passionate practitioner played by an appropriately worn-out looking Jimmy Smits. Beth’s penchant for bad decision-making (exemplified by her job interview with a restaurant manager played by a weaselly Jason Biggs) makes Jess’s eventual determination to take on her case look like a weird hiccup in the lawyer’s common sense. But the action speaks eloquently about the corner into which Jess has allowed herself to be pushed.The writer-director Matthew Newton’s film is about the idea of justice in everyday life, as epitomized by a speech Mr. Smits’s character gives to the doubtful Jess in a key scene. Superbly acted and confidently shot, “Who We Are Now” delivers substantial dramatic pleasures while posing pertinent questions."

Melancholy, yes, and even momentarily wrenching; yet its emotional arc bends insistently from inarticulate sadness to gentle catharsis.Unfolding during a sun-dappled summer in the Catalonian countryside, this autobiographical debut (culled from the childhood memories and family stories of the writer and director, Carla Simón) is light on drama yet dense with unspoken feeling. At the center of every scene is 6-year-old Frida (a shockingly composed Laia Artigas), whose mother’s death from AIDS-related pneumonia has caused her to be transplanted from a Barcelona apartment to the rural home of her young uncle and his wife (David Verdaguer and Bruna Cusí).As Frida struggles to adjust to the unfamiliar rhythms of her welcoming new family and the companionship of her younger cousin, Anna (Paula Robles), the movie evokes her emotional fragility with a series of low-key yet vivid vignettes. Frida’s scraped knee provokes alarm from a village mother, who hustles her bewildered daughter away from the blood, and mild incidents of callousness toward little Anna reveal Frida’s uncertainty about where she fits in. A scene where she dresses like a woman and lounges, pretend-smoking, on a deck chair reminds us that memories of her mother are lingeringly lucid.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018Filmed in the locations where the director lived at that age, “Summer 1993” is movingly understated and beautifully acted. The colors are muted and the style is naturalistic; swimming ponds and poultry and heat-languid vegetables enable the children’s games, and the cinematographer, Santiago Racaj, crouches down to toddler height to watch. Through his lens, we see an entirely new family being born."

It depicts a petit bourgeois household: Georges (Marcel André) an ineffectual patriarch and would-be inventor; Yvonne (Yvonne de Bray) a diabetic who is introduced passed out in front of a sink, having botched her insulin injection; Léo (Gabrielle Dorziat), Yvonne’s sister and a former lover of Georges, who appears to possess the family’s only income; and finally Michel (Jean Marais), the son, in his 20s, whom Yvonne dotes on.Conversing with Léo about Michel’s whereabouts (he has spent the night away from home), Yvonne is terrified that her son might have a lover. Those fears are realized when Michel bounces into the apartment and tells his mom about his girl, Madeleine (Josette Day, who co-starred with Marais in “Beauty and the Beast”). Additionally, Madeleine is trying to get out from under a sugar daddy, who happens to be Georges. “Whether comedy or tragedy, it’s a masterpiece,” Georges says to Léo as they try to construct a web of lies to hide the truth from Michel and Yvonne.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 21, 2018The joke, as it turns out, is that there are no real secrets and there’s nothing genuinely at stake. Or at least there isn’t until one or another character arbitrarily concludes that everything’s ruined. As silly and trivial-minded as these characters are (Marais, so imposing in his incarnations as Cocteau’s Beast and Orpheus, does superb work playing a simpering dolt), Cocteau’s dramatic model, as ever, never strays too far from Greek tragedy and resolves appropriately.The influential French critic André Bazin called this film one in which “the notion of the ‘shot’ is finally disposed of.” I wouldn’t go quite that far, but the unobtrusive formal virtuosity on display here — particularly the fluidity of the shooting and cutting (the cinematographer was Michel Kelber, the editor Jacqueline Sadoul) — demonstrates Cocteau’s unique command of the medium. The fact that he directed fewer than a dozen films makes this one a very special treasure now."

Directed by John Cameron Mitchell (loosely adapting a Neil Gaiman short story), this loony romantic comedy, set in the London suburb of Croydon in 1977, encourages young love to bloom in the soil of an alien visitation.And why not? The Queen’s Silver Jubilee celebration is in the wings, and the punk-preoccupied lads at the movie’s center are up for all sorts of mischief. Led by Enn (Alex Sharp), an aspiring graphic novelist, the friends rock out at a local club then, drawn by strange tunes and the hope of an all-night party, wash up on the doorstep of a mysterious mansion. Inside they discover what looks like a Cirque du Soleil warm-up session — or one of those old “Sprockets” skits from “Saturday Night Live” — but is actually a commune of sexually adventurous alien tourists.Enn is particularly drawn to Zan (Elle Fanning), their single-syllable connection reinforced by interspecies curiosity. Obtaining a 48-hour pass from her collective, Zan joins Enn for a weekend of working-class wandering and a ramshackle punk-rock concert — a scene whose rowdy, pile-driving vitality only spotlights the sagginess of the movie around it. Ms. Fanning has an otherworldly glow that’s exactly right, but her character is no more defined or articulate than any other. And Mr. Sharp, who’s now 29, is as credible playing a teenager as most of the leads in “Riverdale.” (I’m not sure what to do with a safety-pin-bedecked Nicole Kidman as the doyenne of Croydon’s underground music scene, so I’m just leaving that one alone.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018CreditCreditDean Rogers/A24Moving from an abandoned housing project to the companionable din of a punk-saturated basement, “How to Talk to Girls at Parties” is a kitschy, spaced-out oddity. The energy peaks and droops, pogoes and flatlines, with Sandy Powell’s kooky costumes doing much of the visual heavy lifting. (I especially liked the white, hooded onesies for their callback to the spermatozoa from Woody Allen’s “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.”) And if the ending is unexpectedly sweet, the ideas that precede it are all over the place: A glancing ecological message about overpopulation is left to dangle, as is the story’s positioning of punk defiance as an antidote to hive-mind conformity.Rubbing blue-collar grit and grime against sterile futurism and free-love hippie nostalgia, Mr. Mitchell shows — as he did in his 2001 debut, “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” and the dizzily hedonistic “Shortbus” five years later — his talent for imbuing outré sex with a joyful, youthful innocence. Like Enn and Zan, he doesn’t really want to go deep; he’s much more content to play, starry-eyed, on the surface."

And why not. They’ve already gotten you to invest quite a lot in this clever little thriller.Set in London, the plot centers on Sofia (Natalie Dormer), a blind pianist working as a studio musician scoring films — a nice in-joke for a movie that itself features some very effective music (by Niall Byrne). Now and then she encounters Veronique (Emily Ratajkowski), who lives in the apartment above her.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018One night Sofia hears a dispute upstairs, followed by Veronique’s fall from a balcony. What seems like murder becomes more complicated as details emerge about Veronique’s life — her father is accused of Serbian war crimes, and is the subject of much media attention — and about Sofia’s, too. Soon a determined cop (Neil Maskell) and two mysterious figures (Ed Skrein and Joely Richardson) are also involved.Anthony Byrne, the director, wrote the screenplay with Ms. Dormer and he keeps the pacing tight while adding a slick style to several scenes, like when a street fight is shown only in shadows against a wall, or when one character’s attempt to poison another generates nail-gnawing tension.A shaky late reveal threatens to close the film on an unconvincing note, but Ms. Dormer and the cast remain dedicated to the story, and that helps the audience do the same. Still, even if you don’t entirely agree with where they’ve taken you, the ride alone is worth your time."

Within its isolated, frugally furnished walls, dozens of innocent campers have been variously subjected to flesh-eating viruses, ravening cannibals or unwisely resurrected demons, all providing ample excuse for flaying and freaking out.Following this well-trodden path, Mark H. Young’s “Feral” sends half a dozen newly graduated college students — and their interpersonal resentments — into a nameless forest. Tents are barely pitched before the one with the weakest bladder is stalked and disemboweled (Jerry Constantine’s special-effects team doesn’t mess around), the attacker resembling a slavering, hairless hybrid of man and coyote. And when the victim mysteriously resurrects, the survivors are relieved to be offered sanctuary in the cabin of a taciturn stranger (Lew Temple) who seems strangely unfazed by their gruesome plight.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018Methodical and efficient, the script (by Mr. Young and Adam Frazier) gets some mileage from its generic setting and zombie-infection theme, even if the croaking order is easily predicted. Less anticipated is a gender dynamic that places a lesbian couple front and center, with the pragmatic Alice (Scout Taylor-Compton) fighting to save her girlfriend and their contaminated pals from losing more than their hair and teeth. While she does, the cinematographer, Christos C. Bitsakos, has a fine time capturing the men in grisly states of injury and decay, sometimes to humorous effect. I expect the actor who had to crouch menacingly on top of a dresser never meant to remind us of an aggravated tabby, but who knows?"

But Isolde’s solidarity with Volker places her at odds with her friends and teachers. In the film’s delightful and refreshing twist on pulp fantasies of repressed Catholic schoolgirls, Isolde’s problem is the result of her school’s decidedly secular orthodoxy.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018CreditCreditJ.Jackie Baier/Cartilage FilmsThe headmistress of Isolde’s school, Big Mother (played to pithy perfection by Susanne Sachsse), aims to indoctrinate her students with second-wave feminist polemics that trumpet the superiority of women to men. Her goal is to build a terrorist cell of guerrilla girls ready to fight the patriarchy, and therefore Volker, like all other men, is her sworn enemy.Under Big Mother’s tutelage, the trainees of her Female Liberation Army are encouraged to practice lesbian separatism as the revolutionary model for a future society without male domination. They plan to fund their rebellion by selling home-produced pornography. But for Isolde, who is transgender, the binary thinking of the Female Liberation Army leaves her in physical and sexual limbo. Though she shares the desire to end patriarchal violence, she does not share a common physicality with the other women in Big Mother’s army. So while her comrades cavort, Isolde is forced to remain covert with the sympathetic and sexy Volker.Even with its tongue planted firmly in cheek, “The Misandrists” is an unmistakably political film, but its aims are not to echo the goals of the fictional Female Liberation Army. Instead Mr. LaBruce utilizes camp, that unifying language of queer cinema, to undermine the credos of trans-exclusionary radical feminism. His actors are colorfully styled as lesbian archetypes, with soft butches sprinkled in among the eye-shadowed punks and earth mothers. Their recitations of Big Mother’s doctrines are stiff, encouraging the audience to doubt the sincerity of their cause.Mr. LaBruce’s irony only ceases when he shows his characters languishing in the fluidity of their erotic desires. Sex is depicted with graphic frankness in “The Misandrists,” and it is through sex — through the amorphous demands of the body — that these characters first encounter the limitations of their ideology. Lesbians find subversive inspiration in gay male pornography, trans women experience and inspire passion for both men and women, and even straight men are only one liaison (and one surgery) away from enlightenment. With “The Misandrists,” Mr. LaBruce announces, here is queer cinema: confrontational, pansexual, gender-fluid, racially inclusive, angry and surprisingly romantic."

A nod to Jackie Kennedy, of course. But also the films of Luchino Visconti, he says. And Empress Sisi of Austria.Earlier in the film, discussing a designer’s collection, he declares, “Eskimos were treated like the aristocrats, and the aristocrats were treated like the serfs.”Mr. Talley’s kinetic word association is loud, geyserlike and inspiring. And as a figure, he is joyous, absurd, leonine but tender. Yet even with this raw material, “Gospel” doesn’t rise to Mr. Talley’s vitality. The director, Kate Novack, has delivered a film that’s detailed and affectionate, but also frustratingly static, making a point not to get in its subject’s way.The parts of Mr. Talley’s story told through archival footage are fascinating — a staggeringly tall gay black man from the American South inventing himself as a bon vivant (“You can be aristocratic without having been born into an aristocratic family”) and making himself welcome, and essential, at the pinnacle of the Paris and New York fashion world. As high fashion was becoming pop culture, Mr. Talley was there, first as a kind of aide-de-camp to Diana Vreeland, and later as an essential compatriot to Anna Wintour in her early Vogue days. (In the film, Ms. Wintour says he knows more about fashion history than she does.)ImageMr. Talley and Diana Ross at Studio 54 in a scene from the documentary “The Gospel According to André.”CreditJohn Bright/Magnolia PicturesVideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018But when Ms. Novack — a producer, with her husband, Andrew Rossi, of “Page One: Inside The New York Times” — gets her lens on Mr. Talley, she doesn’t push hard. He is too fixed in the public imagination to be anything other than the stuff of legend, and he is too legendary to be a truly vulnerable subject.There are occasional scenes of intimacy, including glimpses inside his home, or a couple of minutes on his attempts to lose weight at the Duke Diet and Fitness Center (after beginning to gain weight in his 40s, “bloated like a manatee” is how he describes his current state). And in one poignant and seemingly unplanned moment, Mr. Talley, now 68, tears up recalling the racially motivated slights that pockmarked his early career.He doesn’t linger, though. While “Gospel” makes the civil rights movement an implicit subplot — he recalls the Durham hat store in which black women had to put on veils before they were allowed to try on hats — and uses the political rise of Donald J. Trump as a loose framing device, it shies away from deep excavations on race and fashion.Or deep excavations of any kind, really. Mr. Talley agreed to have the cameras turned on him, but he does not give off the impression of wanting to be known. Even the testimonials from designer friends — Marc Jacobs, Norma Kamali, Tom Ford (who comes off like a Keanu Reeves character) — sometimes feel like notes from kindhearted strangers.In the moments where Mr. Talley is called upon to perform his public self, though, he shines. To fully capture his essence would require a film more comfortable with kaleidoscopic luxury and unselfconscious whimsy — say, something along the lines of “The Kid Stays in the Picture.” But “Gospel” presumes that simply filling the screen with Mr. Talley is enough. If anyone could spot the flaw in that thinking — and offer up countless robust ideas on how to elevate it — it would probably be him."

Which is by no means to say that the film, directed by Haifaa al-Mansour (“Wadjda”) forgoes the expected pleasures of the genre. You get candlelight and quill pens, Regency gowns and celebrity shout-outs (Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in the house!), and of course the usual feverish attempts to convey both the passion and the discipline of the writing process. Also good-looking young actors declaiming poetry and prose in crisply accented, grammatically flawless English.But rather than smother Mary Shelley — author of “Frankenstein,” daughter of two eminent writers and wife of another — with soft cushions of antiquarian cultural prestige, Ms. al-Mansour and the screenwriter, Emma Jensen, sharpen the sense of Shelley’s modernity. It helps enormously that she is played with alert sensitivity and acute intelligence by Elle Fanning.We first encounter Mary in motion, dashing home from a London cemetery where she has been scribbling furiously at the graveside of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. That Mary, who died shortly after giving birth to her daughter, was the author of “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” a work of 18th-century feminist thought that has yet to lose its radicalism or its relevance. Wollstonecraft’s husband, the novelist, philosopher and bookseller William Godwin (Stephen Dillane), has remarried, and Mary must contend with a mean stepmother (Joanne Froggatt) who disapproves of her writing.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 14, 2018William, to keep peace in the household, sends Mary off to Scotland, where she meets Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Booth), a dreamy dirtbag lit bro who will in due course die young and be remembered as one of the great English poets of his time. Percy is 21 and has already abandoned one wife and child, but his capital-R romantic idealism includes a few clauses about free love that chime with Mary’s rebellious inheritance. Also he has soft lips, delicate cheekbones and a way with rhymes, so before long Mary has run off with him and brought her stepsister, Claire (Bel Powley), along on the adventure.It turns out rougher than Mary, who is 16, anticipated. There is tragedy, scandal, money trouble and Percy’s mercurial (though in some ways entirely predictable) behavior. The commitment to unconventional, liberated lives that he and Mary share means different things to each of them, and the film emphasizes the gap between theory and practice when it comes to equality between the sexes. Traditional roles may oppress and stultify women, but the free-and-easy hedonism Mary and Claire find with Percy and Lord Byron (a scene-stealing Tom Sturridge) is no great bargain either.But Byron’s Swiss chateau is nonetheless where the seed of “Frankenstein” is planted, and “Mary Shelley” is as much a biography of that book as of its author. The book originates during a highbrow parlor game at Byron’s, where Mary, Claire and Percy are hanging out with a physician named John Polidori (Ben Hardy). But the film expands on this origin story, suggesting various streams of Mary’s experience that feed into her chronicle of a misunderstood monster. Her childhood fondness for scary tales and the literary influence of her father (author of the Gothic novel “Caleb Williams”) combine with her own grief, frustration and isolation to produce a masterpiece.This account is plausible and moving, at once a defense of genre fiction and of female creativity. But at times the differences between male and female writers can seem a bit schematic, in a way that undermines Mary’s intellectual autonomy. William, Percy and Byron are understood to be motivated by ideas, while Mary’s inspirations come from the realm of feeling. “Frankenstein” is thus, above all, a triumph of expression, the quasi-therapeutic transformation of pain into art. Some of the durable insights it offers to readers — into the risks of scientific inquiry and technological innovation, into the philosophical complexity of human identity — are slighted in favor of its cathartic power in the life of the writer.Still, the acknowledgment of Mary Shelley seems long overdue, and “Mary Shelley” is a reminder that England in the early 19th century remains a rich repository of stories and characters, an era that can be made to feel charmingly quaint and bracingly modern, on both the page and the screen."

Roughly translated, those are the last words in Robert Bresson’s “Pickpocket,” a movie that figures prominently in the work of Paul Schrader, who has alluded to its final scene in many of his films, including “American Gigolo,” “Light Sleeper” and his new one, “First Reformed.” A tortuous spiritual journey through debasement and self-deception leads, in the end, to an experience of communion, the discovery of another soul who had been there all along, awaiting recognition.Which is more or less how I feel — improbably, miraculously, at long last — about Mr. Schrader. He is 71, and has had a long and varied career, but “First Reformed” nonetheless feels like a fresh discovery. More than that: an epiphany.A first-rate cinema intellectual — as a 24-year-old graduate student he wrote “Transcendental Style in Film,” a study of Bresson, Yasujiro Ozu and Carl Dreyer that is still worth reading (and has just been reissued) — Mr. Schrader has been, to put it mildly, an uneven filmmaker. A certain studiousness afflicts even his most accomplished work as a screenwriter and director, a tendency to put his erudition ahead of his instincts. “First Reformed,” with its evident debt to Dreyer and Bresson (most obviously “Diary of a Country Priest”), might seem to follow in this vein, but it works through its influences to achieve an uncanny directness. It is the portrait of a soul in torment, all the more powerful for being so rigorously conceived and meticulously executed.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018The soul in question belongs to the Rev. Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke), a Protestant minister in upstate New York. Toller’s church, with its slender steeple and whitewashed clapboards, evokes both a bygone era of American Christianity and a battered civic order, a small-town world of hard work, humility and faith. As the 250th anniversary of the church’s consecration approaches, the pews are mostly empty on Sunday. A few tourists and school groups straggle in during the week. The real religious action is down the road at Abundant Life, a modern megachurch overseen by Joel Jeffers (Cedric Kyles, also known as Cedric the Entertainer). First Reformed, where Toller, a former military chaplain, tends his paltry flock, is known as “the gift shop.”That materialism bothers Toller — “this is not the church I was called to,” he says at one point, referring not to First Reformed but to the larger ecclesiastical body — even if the peace and quiet suit him fine. He spends his nights in the rectory with a bottle of whiskey and a journal, recording his thoughts in an effort to master the anguish and confusion that plague him. The diary becomes a record of his unraveling, as contemplative melancholy spirals into despair.The process and its sources are subtle and complicated. Toller is mourning the loss of a child and the end of a marriage. An affair with the Abundant Life choir director (Victoria Hill) has ended awkwardly. Toller’s physical health is deteriorating along with his mental state, and the world is in a horrible state. A young woman named Mary (Amanda Seyfried) asks Toller to counsel her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger), an environmental activist recently imprisoned in Canada. Mary is pregnant, and Michael can’t bear the thought of raising a child in the face of ecological catastrophe. Toller’s kindness and wisdom, while sincere, are not enough.There are several ways to describe what happens to him — as a midlife crisis, a psychological breakdown, a political awakening or a religious reckoning. Mr. Schrader doesn’t suggest that these are mutually exclusive choices, but rather shows how the strands of Toller’s experience twist into a rope that binds and scourges him, until extreme actions start to feel logical and inevitable.ImageAmanda Seyfried in the film.CreditA24Some of the filmmaker’s techniques — the slow rumble and unnerving hush of the sound design; the deep shadows of the digital cinematography (by Alexander Dynan); the smooth, ghostly movements of the camera — make “First Reformed” feel like a horror movie, which in some ways it is. The source of the terror, though, is not a supernatural presence but a metaphysical absence. A poem by Robert Lowell records an 18th-century preacher’s feeling that “the breath of God had carried out a planned and sensible withdrawal from this land,” leaving His creatures to their own infernal devices. Toller stares into the same abyss.We see it reflected in Mr. Hawke’s face. His brow is bisected by a deep furrow, and his former prettiness has weathered into something much more interesting. The risk in playing this kind of suffering lies in the temptation to externalize the misery, but Mr. Hawke strips away everything that might turn this into a performance. Until the very end, Toller maintains a proper pastoral demeanor, conveying the compassion and self-containment that are aspects of both his temperament and his professionalism. His doubt and anger are confined to his journals. His Gethsemane is inside him.But his struggle is also a response to external events. The pollution and corruption he perceives aren’t just in his head. He is less and less comfortable with the smiling, full-service spiritualism of Abundant Life, and more and more alienated from the beliefs and institutions that had once sustained him. He finds some comfort in Mary’s company, even as he also starts to suspect that Michael might have been right.“First Reformed” wrestles with contemporary reality, but it isn’t a work of realism in the way that term is conventionally understood. The dialogue is delivered with formal, almost stiff cadences, and the images are crisp, graceful and plain. This austerity isn’t meant to capture the rhythms of ordinary existence, but rather to present a heightened, filtered, clarified picture of what that existence might mean. It asks us to take another look at what we think we know about politics, religion and other things we like to argue about, and asks nothing more than our quiet attention.There is something radical about that, and about Mr. Schrader’s stubborn faith in movies. Like Toller’s diary, his film is an assertion of order in the face of chaos, an effort to organize something that is by its very nature an unholy mess: one person’s life."

He wears a bracelet on his ankle that monitors him; he’s out of prison after doing time for an unspecified crime and still under house arrest. He can’t get permission to travel out of state for a family function.When he goes out for a run — his toned physique speaks of a devotion to fitness — he’s greeted outside his home by some cartoonishly thuggish types who remind him they were there for him “on the inside.” Keith’s reaction suggests he’s not interested in what they’re selling.Back in the house, Keith fires up the computer and tries to get into an online course related to his stated ambition of learning a trade. It would be salutary to learn one, but he is easily distracted. He soon goes to Facebook instead, looking up an old friend, a tattooed fellow who posts pictures of himself delighting in thug poses.But Keith, his internet meanderings notwithstanding, perhaps feels done with the idea that the lifestyle of his one-time friend (now an enemy, it turns out) is something to aspire to. When his father, played by a low-key Jim Belushi, observes that Keith feels guilty about too many things, he shoots back: “I don’t have a problem with guilt. I just have a problem with knowing that I let everybody down.” His dad has an answer that he’s perhaps given dozens of times before: “Well then don’t!”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018But Keith can’t seem to help it. His impulses get the better of him. And as this deliberate, involving film from the Maryland-based filmmaker Matthew Porterfield moves along, the young man frequently forgets his best intentions and escalates in anger and frustration every time things don’t go his way.Characters like this one can be infuriating. But Mr. Lombardi imbues Keith with an ordinary likability — a quality that does evaporate somewhat as he makes ever more aggressively bad choices.Mr. Porterfield’s evenhanded direction doesn’t try to pull the viewer’s sympathies one way or another. Within his realistic mode he crafts some startling effects — a strip-club brawl that spills out into broad, embarrassing daylight is eye-opening.Mr. Porterfield also excels in depicting Keith’s nerve-racking environment, a segregated neighborhood in which Keith has divided interests: Most of his friends, including his one-time girlfriend Courtney (the superb Zazie Beetz) are African-American. But his associates from “inside” are White Power gangsters — Michael Rogers, as the evil scoutmaster of this crew, is chilling in a scene in which Keith asks for a break — one of many that he cannot catch in this quietly brutal story."

It delivers.In Raja Gosnell’s canine comedy, Max (voiced by Ludacris) is a laconic Rottweiler with the New York Police Department who sniffs the trail of an international animal smuggling ring. When the clues lead to a swanky dog show in Las Vegas, Max is assigned to the case as the pooch partner for Frank (Will Arnett), a combative F.B.I. agent. Aided by Frank’s agency contacts and Max’s purebred informants, the two search for their human culprit.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018“Show Dogs” mixes digital effects with footage of trained dogs to achieve its elaborate flights of fancy. One result of having real dogs on screen is that the dumbest of the doggy dialogue is easy to tune out in favor of the amiably dunderheaded pleasure of watching a pack of pups solve crime. Moments of cleverness zing out from the din, as when RuPaul voices a four-legged fashionista, or a spectacular Komondor (Shaquille O’Neal) offers Max his best Zen mantras.Enthusiasts for particular breeds may be disappointed to find that “Show Dogs” spotlights Rottweilers and Papillons over bulldogs and bloodhounds, but more frustrating for the impartial dog lover is the extreme imbalance of screen time between male and female dogs. In a movie intended for families, it is frustrating that both humans and hounds who are gendered female find themselves relegated to love interest roles. But if “Show Dogs” sometimes betrays its shaggy charms, there is comfort in remembering that many movies are much dumber than this one, and so few of them have either the good taste or the good manners to compensate with puppies."

It’s also clear that you need sensitive, humane filmmaking to insist that one is very different from the other. The average documentary would gawk. This one reclassifies: One person’s pack rat is another’s collector. And Michael Zahs, this movie’s sturdily built, mighty bearded subject, does indeed collect.An entire room of his rural eastern Iowa home is full of, among many other things, antique-looking carpentry tools. Another contains a file cabinet crammed with precious entertainment memorabilia, and, to open it, Mr. Zahs has to wedge himself between it and a larger piece of loaded shelving. He’s got stuff stored at his mother’s farm. And don’t ask about the gazebo, felled out front, demurely sheeted by snow. It wasn’t his — until it was.But there’s something loosely exalted about Mr. Zahs. He actually doesn’t collect, per se. His relationship to possessions (and animals) is more cosmically passive. A lot of what he has he’s accumulated. Even his pets found him. In a sense, so did that enormous trove of memorabilia, which includes reels of early silent short films by pioneers like Georges Méliès. It all once belonged to a local couple, Frank and Indiana Brinton, who traveled around long ago, dazzling people with what at the time would have been popular culture’s future. And, for years, Mr. Zahs has been as delighted to share the magic of popular culture’s past. (He bought the collection in 1981 from the Brintons’ neighbor.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018This is a man who prizes his material — old prints and projection equipment, but also photographs, posters, instruments, sheet music, hand fans and flipbooks — and, when we meet him, is in the process of handing it over to the University of Iowa. (Martin Scorsese, whose “Hugo” was about Méliès, expressed some interest in the collection, but apparently that went nowhere.) Mr. Zahs and his undiscovered Méliès film from 1901, however, do sufficiently impress both the Library of Congress and the filmmaker and historian Serge Bromberg.The result is a celebratory 90-minute documentary — Tommy Haines and Andrew Sherburne directed it; John Richard and Mr. Haines did the editing — that generously (justly!) makes room to show some of these movies. And any time spent watching a Méliès tends to end in shortness of breath and tears of joy. But Mr. Zahs has made himself so available that the movie feels torn about where to focus. You can feel its admiration for this man’s obsessive passion. Well, passions. True to the retired schoolteacher he is, Mr. Zahs waxes on about nativity scenes, cemeteries and that old farm equipment just as heartily as he does about long-lost silent movies and the technology used to show them.So we get not just film preservation but also a livestock auction, classroom visits, a trip to Europe, a reunion event and several stops at the nursing home where his mother resides. What’s most stirring (after the silent movies) is the piecemeal emergence of vibrant small-town life and the pride Mr. Zahs takes in it. But that feels more incidental, since Mr. Zahs might be the romantic ideal of that life.The movie’s hands-off approach does often amount to something poignant. In sharing what he’s accrued over the decades, Mr. Zahs manages to share a lot of himself. He’s a nearly biblical, certainly biblical-looking, caretaker — of people, places and things. But this movie might want too much to take care of him. That affection means a film that’s happier to present than to interrogate, although I wish somebody had asked about the photo of a man, who might be Mr. Brinton, seated, holding a mandolin, in blackface. (In lieu of inquiry, the soundtrack gives us a rendition of “Old Folks at Home,” one of Stephen Foster’s minstrel-era classics.)But the trouble is that despite how earnest and committed Mr. Zahs appears to be, the story of what’s in the collection might be more be more fascinating than the man who’s collected it."

Before long Tadek is caught in a cat-and-mouse game with Kozlov and his girlfriend, Kasia (Charlotte Gainsbourg).Throughout the film, prologue undermines payoff as scenes are shot in exceedingly deliberate takes. When these terse and cryptic characters finally decide to speak, there’s sure to be a buildup, a long stare and a pained expression to linger over; everything here feels a third longer than necessary. By the time the semi-interesting ending arrives, you’re already exhausted.From the start, Mr. Carrey lurks around the shadowy sets and dilapidated rooms, obsessed. He is committed to his stooped-shoulder character, and admirably invested in the path the film follows, even as it meanders. Jeremy Brock’s script does him no favors. While David Grann’s New Yorker piece was focused and taut, Mr. Brock and the director Alexandros Avranas have serious problems with pacing.“Dark Crimes” finds its better moments in the final act, when the characters are forced into some kind of action, and as the dark color schemes endeavor to create an atmosphere the script can’t. Indeed, there’s often an interesting shot to see, at the expense of a story to watch."

The film captures them enacting a possibly willful pantomime of gracious living while practically ankle-deep in squalor. The fact that this pair were the aunt and cousin of the former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and her sister, the socialite Lee Radziwill, added to their peculiar mystique.The metaphoric implications of the spectacle presented in “Grey Gardens” were not lost among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people of the time, who made the movie an instant classic. The Beales became figures of mordant fun but also cultural touchstones.“That Summer,” a new documentary directed by Goran Hugo Olsson, sheds further light on the Beales with footage shot before the making of “Grey Gardens.” The photographer Peter Beard, whose camera appreciated both the wilds of Africa and the supermodels and superstars of the 1960s and ’70s, opens the film from his Montauk home. Now 80, he pages through a coffee-table book of his own photography and reminisces.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018Eventually he describes a project he undertook with his friend Ms. Radziwill, an “environmental film” about the Hamptons. Ms. Radziwill, in voice-over, recalls her notion to enlist her “extremely eccentric aunt” — that would be Big Edie — to “be the narrator for my memories.”In the summer of 1972 Mr. Beard and Ms. Radziwill hired a film crew — which included Albert Maysles, one of the future directors of “Grey Gardens” — and embarked to the Beales’ estate. Most of this film is devoted to four reels shot there, in which the Beales’ living conditions are worse than what’s depicted in the 1975 film. At one point there’s a debate as to what food they gave to the raccoons living on the grounds caused said raccoons to fall sick.Little Edie, who after her mother died developed a nightclub act, regales a cameraperson and Ms. Radziwill with a rendition of the obscure ’40s pop song “My Adobe Hacienda.” Of the modernization and cleanup for Grey Gardens proposed by Mrs. Onassis, Little Edie says, “I think it’s very cute of Jackie to try and bring us up-to-date.” Mr. Beard and Ms. Radziwill eventually abandoned the project, but Albert Maysles and his brother, David, determined to revisit the Beales shortly after.Mr. Beard’s view of the Beales in this period is possibly unique. “I never thought of the Beales as unfortunate or sad or anything except very excellent at feeling what it was like to hold on to the past,” he says.The movie ends with the aged Mr. Beard (who is also an executive producer of this movie) in his home studio, and the strong implication that he is feeling the same."

It’s a mystifying feeling, and a good reason to see this documentary that extols the wonders of science and of all that’s yet to discover.The film begins deep underground as Jennifer Macalady, an American geomicrobiologist, explores simple life-forms found in the Frasassi Caves in Italy. As part of the documentary’s plan she travels to visit a scientist she has never met, who studies a discipline she is unfamiliar with — Davide D’Angelo, an Italian physicist researching dark matter — to discuss some of his work and how their fields may overlap.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018Mr. D’Angelo then goes to call on Axel Cleeremans, a Belgian professor of cognitive psychology, who later travels to see yet another researcher. The meetings continue, like a “La Ronde” of intellectuals, until we hear from nine scientists in fields including astronomy and neuroscience.It’s a clever idea and the director, Ian Cheney, captures several nice moments, particularly when the scientists show us their less serious sides. Yet there are drawbacks — it’s tough to get a simple grasp of, say, brain physiology or microbial evolution when each segment lasts just 10 or so minutes. And the scientists, while brilliant in their fields, are often less skilled as interviewers.“The Most Unknown” works best as inspiration to delve deeper into these disciplines, and as a celebration of science. And when the film comes up short it still functions like an intriguing experiment: It doesn’t have to be entirely successful for you to learn something."

Early on, Mr. Wenders points out three pertinent firsts about the man and his position: He is the first Jesuit pope, the first pope to hail from the Americas (he was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936, in Argentina), and the first pope to adopt the name of St. Francis of Assisi. For Mr. Wenders, this last fact is most significant. The film begins with a long, high angle shot of the Italian village of Assisi, done in time-lapse cinematography to convey what the filmmaker considers the timeless nature of the place.For much of this movie, Mr. Wenders frames the pope in a plain medium close-up and invites the man to speak his mind. With his kind face, intelligent gaze, and ready smile, Francis is an amiable and compelling figure. He is not what you would call starry-eyed, though. He shows considerable knowledge of the horrors of the modern world and speaks with simplicity, informed by philosophical inquiry, about what the Roman Catholic Church can do to counter it.Mr. Wenders’s singular focus on Pope Francis is born of sincere admiration, but it also constitutes a canny strategy. This pope is a controversial one, and this portrait plucks him out of the context of debated opinions to let him speak without argument. “The world is mostly deaf,” he says at one point. He continues to describe his approach when traveling the world and meeting its leaders: “Talk little. Listen a lot.” Nevertheless, in this film the pope is given his say, at length.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018CreditCreditFocus FeaturesThe interview sections are fascinating, and scenes of the pope’s travels, during which he frequently washes the feet of those who come to him, are moving. His shedding of the trappings of the papacy and adoption of relative austerity — extending to the use of a very small car as his designated “popemobile” — buttress the assertion of the movie’s title.Less welcome are Mr. Wenders’s brief attempts at depicting the life of St. Francis himself. These are done in an approximation of silent-movie style: in black and white with a bit of flicker in the image. I don’t know what Mr. Wenders was thinking here. If this was a whimsical attempt at mass-audience accessibility, no whimsy or lightness is conveyed. It just feels dumb. And frustrating, especially considering that if Mr. Wenders wanted a classic film model to emulate for evoking St. Francis, he needed look no further than Roberto Rossellini’s splendid 1950 film “The Flowers of St. Francis.”"

But the problems they face owe less to their inexperience than to the absence of a shared vocabulary adequate to their feelings and desires. Larkin, after all, didn’t mean that nobody went to bed before his designated “Annus Mirabilis” (the title of his poem). He meant that nobody talked much about what went on there, because they were in thrall to “a shame that started at sixteen/and spread to everything.” In the decades since, it can seem as if nobody has talked about anything else.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018Mr. McEwan, who was born in 1948 — and is thus a crucial decade younger than Florence and Edward (and a full generation younger than poor Philip Larkin) — has made a career out of exploring the gray areas between erotic innocence and carnal knowledge. In book form, “On Chesil Beach” has a gently retrospective point of view, with occasional sentences that foreshadow the enormous changes to come “later in that famous decade.”The film, for which Mr. McEwan wrote the screenplay, draws a pictorial veil between past and present. As is customary with literary adaptations of this kind, subjective impressions are filtered through physical details. The production and costume designs (by Suzie Davies and Keith Madden) are impeccable and understated. You notice, and appreciate, the accurate rendering of the clothes the characters wear, the books they read, the food they eat and the bicycles they ride. The real 1962 could not possibly have felt this much like 1962.This makes Florence and Edward’s world both beautiful and distant. The job of bringing it nearer and adding a human dimension to the beauty falls to Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, who are more than up to the task. Ms. Ronan may be the keenest, subtlest, smartest actress under 30 working in movies today, and while Mr. Howle’s is a less familiar face, it is one of those faces you can’t stop observing. He has some of the half-rough, half-pretty charisma of a young Michael York, and he plays Edward with a perfect blend of diffidence and defensiveness.Edward and Florence, who encounter each other at a disarmament meeting on the Oxford University campus, court each other across a small but not inconsequential class divide. She is the daughter of a factory owner (Samuel West) and a philosophy professor (Emily Watson). Edward’s father (Adrian Scarborough) is a schoolmaster. His mother (Anne-Marie Duff), who suffered a head injury when Edward was a child, paints and makes collages and wanders around the house and garden in a state of permanent confusion.ImageEdward (Mr. Howle) and Florence (Ms. Ronan) court each other across a small but not inconsequential class divide.CreditRobert Viglasky/Bleecker StreetFlorence is a classical violinist, one of the founders of an ambitious string quartet. Edward, a graduate of the University of London, prefers rhythm and blues and dreams of writing a series of popular history books. Their interests and sensibilities, while not identical, seem perfectly complementary. They imagine a life ahead full of interesting conversations about politics, art and ideas, punctuated with leisurely picnics and walks in the woods. Their intimacy seems perfect, and their love is surely built to last.Except for the sex part. “On Chesil Beach” has both a rich sense of how much more there is to life than sex, and also an acute awareness of how sex can overwhelm everything else. There is comedy in the shy clumsiness of the young couple, and also excruciating suspense as they make their way toward the hotel bed. What happens there is something perfectly ordinary — or at least entirely believable — and also cataclysmic.Edward and Florence are creatures of their time, but Mr. McEwan and Mr. Cooke don’t insist on their representative status. Their story is highly particular, rooted in the idiosyncrasies of their families and also in an almost invisible crime, a tendril of evil that wraps itself around their destinies. The gentle surface of the film camouflages heartbreak and horror. Its lesson calls to mind another Larkin poem, the one that begins with the frequently quoted (though not in here) line about the damage done to children by their parents.Onscreen, “On Chesil Beach” loses some intensity at the end, as the supple suggestiveness of Mr. McEwan’s prose is replaced by the stagy literalness of film. Perhaps this couldn’t be avoided. His novels are amenable to adaptation, but almost always lose a lot in translation. “Enduring Love” and “Atonement” are two recent examples. “On Chesil Beach” is better than either of those. It’s a good movie. The book is something more — close to perfect, I would say — but since both incarnations emphasize the importance of tolerating human fallibility, I won’t make too much of the discrepancy."

They started in the ’70s with Erica Jong’s “Fear of Flying” and have just turned their attention to E.L. James’s “Fifty Shades of Grey.” There’s a lot of literary and social history in the span between those two best sellers, which take their heroines from “zipless” adultery to handcuffed monogamy, from elusive liberation to consensual bondage.But this movie isn’t much concerned with the novels themselves. The stories it has to tell about feminism and female sexuality are left mainly implicit in the script (by Bill Holderman and Erin Simms; Mr. Holderman directed) because they are written in the faces of its stars. And much in the way that their characters use reading as a pretext for hanging out and drinking wine — there will be wine in every paragraph of this review, as there is wine in nearly every scene of this film — the filmmakers understand that what will satisfy the audience is time in the company of Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Diane Keaton and Mary Steenburgen.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMay 7, 2018They embody a carefully plotted range of professional and marital situations. Sharon (Ms. Bergen) is a long-divorced federal judge. Diane (Ms. Keaton) is a recently widowed mother of two grown daughters (Alicia Silverstone and Katie Aselton). Vivian (Ms. Fonda) is a proudly unattached hotel owner. Carol (Ms. Steenburgen) is a happily married chef. (All of them are heterosexual.) Having finished with a book that sounds a lot like Cheryl Strayed’s “Wild,” they turn to the adventures of Anastasia Steele. And while they make a few mild jokes about spanking and the Red Room over their glasses of chardonnay, “Fifty Shades” inspires them not to kinky exploration, but to the sharing and eventual correction of their own sexual frustrations.Vivian might want something more than no-strings hookups. Carol is worried that she and her husband, Bruce (Craig T. Nelson), have lost their spark. Sharon has given up on romance, and Diane’s attempts to enjoy her independence are thwarted by her protective, anxious children. But she meets a handsome pilot (Andy Garcia) and drinks wine with him at his place in Sedona. Sharon opens a Bumble account and drinks wine with Richard Dreyfuss. Vivian crosses paths with an old flame (Don Johnson) who still carries a torch for her. (They drink milkshakes.) Carol slips Bruce (who drinks beer) a Viagra mickey.That doesn’t work out so well. Erectile humor is about as naughty as “Book Club” gets and about as imaginative. There is no risk of seriously hurt feelings or biting satire. Even Sharon’s former husband (Ed Begley Jr.) and his much-younger fiancée (Mircea Monroe) are treated with more kindness than scorn. What drives the plot through its genial motions isn’t the struggle for freedom or even the pursuit of happiness, but rather the impulse to improve lives that are already fundamentally (and oenophilically) happy and free.There is an element of fantasy in this, of course, and also a great deal of reality left out of the picture. It does seem a bit odd, for instance, that a comedy about four 70-ish American women in 2018 would have nothing to say about either of the candidates in the most recent presidential election, but this isn’t the only recent movie to respond to the political situation by wishing it out of existence. And besides, these women — Ms. Fonda, Ms. Keaton, Ms. Steenburgen and Ms. Bergen, that is — have nothing to prove. Each one brings enough credibility and charisma to “Book Club” to render its weaknesses largely irrelevant. You’d be happy to watch them read the phone book. Or the Oxford English Dictionary. Or “The Oxford Companion to Wine.”"

Young Han, played by a hard-working, slightly lost-looking Alden Ehrenreich, is introduced as a juvenile delinquent on a dark, rough planet called Corellia, hot-wiring cars and making out with his girlfriend, Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke). The opening scenes carry a faint whiff of the burning rubber, gasoline and adolescent hormones of “American Graffiti,” the 1973 car-crazy coming-of-age picture directed by George Lucas and starring Mr. Howard (with a young Harrison Ford as well).Han is fresh-faced and earnest, a long way from the grizzled, Humphrey Bogart-ish cynicism of “A New Hope.” He and Qi’ra, indentured to a giant centipede with Linda Hunt’s voice, start running like figures in a Springsteen song — we gotta get out while we’re young! — only to find their dreams of escape dashed by the Empire and a criminal syndicate called Crimson Dawn. Han signs up for military service and then deserts. Qi’ra takes a job with a nasty gangster named Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), and the erstwhile lovebirds meet again in his penthouse, where Han, now part of a band of freelance thieves (led by Woody Harrelson’s scene-stealing Beckett) has come to do some business.That’s enough plot for now, though of course, this being a “Star Wars” movie, there is plenty more where that came from, and enough made-up geography, astrophysics and political science to fill a semester of hard study. I should admit that even though I’ve been enrolled, on and off, for most of my life, I’ve been a pretty consistent C student.ImageEmilia Clarke as Qi’ra.CreditLucasfilmHowever, I will also say that I was surprised when a figure from one of the earlier trilogies showed up, and I argued fiercely with an editor (a bigger nerd than I am, by the way) who said such a thing just wasn’t possible. There followed an intensive seminar in the newsroom of The New York Times, during which issues of timeline integrity and what might or might not be canon were debated with appropriate vigor and solemnity. If I say any more, the spoiler police will come after me. Journalism can be an intense business.Unlike “Solo,” which ambles from one set piece to the next in a spirit of genial in-betweenness. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, but it also holds whatever irreverent, anarchic impulses it might possess in careful check. Some fans may blame Mr. Howard for this, and fantasize about what might have been if Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, the “Lego Movie” auteurs originally hired to direct, had been allowed to see the project through. But this galaxy has always been a rule-bound place, and too much divergence from franchise traditions would probably have stirred up its own kind of fan outrage.There’s no reason to be mad. There are some fine action sequences, and some that don’t make much sense at all. There are a handful of secondary characters who come close to upstaging the hero, including Beckett’s companion, Val (Thandie Newton); a radical droid called L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge); and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), the original owner of the Millennium Falcon, Han’s sometime rival and secret ego ideal. And of course Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo).He meets Han in a mud pit, by the way. For the other answers, you’ll have to see for yourself. But one thing that remains curiously unexplored is how Han became the wary, cynical guy Princess Leia (and everyone else) fell for back in the Carter administration. It’s not really Mr. Ehrenreich’s fault that he doesn’t evoke Harrison Ford. (Though the idea of Mr. Glover aging into Billy Dee Williams creates a magical loop in the pop-cultural space-time continuum.) It’s more that the time line can’t quite adjust. Guys like the old Han Solo belong to the past. We’re all supposed to be much nicer now."

Because, you know, Thanos is the name of the villain in “Avengers: Infinity War” who is played by Josh Brolin, who also plays Cable, who is mostly the villain in “Deadpool 2.” So many levels of joke, whizzing by in a split-second of screen time. I chuckled, too, then and at other moments. I’ve seen a lot of superhero movies, and that laughter was like cash back from a credit card. Not exactly a huge windfall relative to the original expenditure — I mean, a “Martha” joke is hardly compensation for having endured “Batman v Superman” — but not nothing either.The script, by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds (who once again plays the title character), is loaded with winky, fourth-wall-piercing eruptions of meta, the kind of humor that can make even the slow-witted and literal-minded feel devilishly clever. Works for me, I guess. But this sequel to the R-rated, X-Men-adjacent surprise blockbuster of 2016 works maybe a little too hard in the service of a dubious cause.VideoDavid Leitch narrates a sequence featuring Ryan Reynolds and Julian Dennison.Published OnMay 17, 2018CreditCredit20th Century FoxThe first “Deadpool,” based on a Marvel character introduced in the early 1990s (his real name is Wade Wilson), presented itself as an antidote to superhero fatigue, but it was really just another gateway drug. If you wanted to get the jokes, you had some homework to do. More than that, the appeal was predicated on a deep enough investment in the genre to sustain both enthusiasm and cynicism.[Ryan Reynolds on making “Deadpool 2.”] “Deadpool 2,” cracking wise at the expense of nearly every intellectual property in the DC and Marvel universes — and occasionally drawing metaphorical blood to go along with the abundant onscreen gore — uses its self-aware irreverence to perform the kind of brand extension and franchise building it pretends to lampoon. By the end, a motley band of warriors has been assembled to fight evil. Another one. Just what we needed. Those jokes about sequels lined up into the next decade aren’t really jokes, are they?In the meantime, we get a sustained dose of Mr. Reynolds’s profane, inventive voice-over, and some kinetic fight scenes, briskly directed by David Leitch. Wade’s face and body are still scarred, and he still dispenses sanguinary rough justice, from behind his makeshift mask, with a pair of ninja swords sheathed in an X across his back. Deadpool’s superpower is his indestructibility. He can’t die even if, for much of the movie, he very much wants to. He is knocked down, cut up, stomped and detonated, and then gets up and keeps fighting.ImageZazie Beetz as the fortunate Domino in “Deadpool 2.”CreditJoe Lederer/20th Century FoxGrief and despair drive Wade first to seek revenge and then to try to prevent two other acts of vengeance from taking place. His feelings also provide him with a permanent alibi. However vicious he may seem, however cavalier in his killing and maiming, his righteousness is always assured. He befriends a boy named Russell (Julian Dennison), who has pyrotechnic abilities and who has been bullied and abused at a Dickensian home for young mutants. Deadpool protects Russell, which helps guarantee Deadpool’s good-guy status.Cable pops onto the scene as the kid’s nemesis, and as a lumbering, square-jawed compendium of knowing clichés. He’s a time traveler with a mechanical arm and a military demeanor, in effect Buzz Lightyear to Deadpool’s Woody. The other misfit toys in the box include Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic), a large titanium-skinned Russian, and Domino (Zazie Beetz), who has the mysterious ability to emerge unscathed from perilous escapades. “Luck is not a superpower,” Deadpool insists, and his skepticism drives an almost-interesting philosophical argument.Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), the love of Wade’s life, warns him that his heart is not in the right place, and there is a softness, a sentimentality, at the heart of “Deadpool 2” that at once guarantees its mass acceptability and undermines its satirical credibility. What drives this franchise is the same force that drives so much culture and politics right now: the self-pity of a white man with a relentless need to be the center of attention. He is angry, violent, disrespectful to everyone and everything, and at the same time thoroughly nontoxic and totally cool.Sure. Great. But there is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. “Deadpool 2” dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."

Clinging to Tara’s anguished face, Laurie Rose’s camera scrutinizes an unhappiness that builds to an almost tangible desperation. Until this point, the cinematography — for all its brutal intimacy — has nurtured a coolness and distance that has isolated Tara from the rambunctious domesticity around her. Then she visits Paris, the screen floods with warmth and softness, and, for the first time, hope seems possible.To its credit, “The Escape” traffics not at all in pat resolutions or moral judgments. Yet its very uncertainties, expressed with piercing honesty, reel you in. In one remarkable scene, Tara weeps silently during sex while Mark stares, baffled. He doesn’t know why she’s crying, but I wager almost every woman in the audience will."

A nasty incident with scissors haunts her past and suggests her mother might have cause to exert control; and when she meets Pascal (Johnny Flynn, perfect), an insinuatingly handsome poacher, she cleaves to him as one would a kindred spirit.Aided and abetted by Benjamin Kracun’s alluringly sensual cinematography, Mr. Pearce has created a feverish fairy tale riven with dark horrors and forbidden desires. Young women are being raped and murdered, and as suspicion circles Pascal, Moll’s behavior is disturbingly unreadable. Does she truly believe he is innocent, or is she drawn to the possibility that he is not?Bathed in a shadowy beauty and slippery psychological atmosphere, “Beast” soars on Ms. Buckley’s increasingly animalistic performance. At one point, Moll settles into the hole where a body has been found, filling her mouth with damp earth. Later, she lounges, filthy, on her mother’s pristine sofa, her nails streaking defiantly muddy trails on the white cloth.

The director, James McTeigue, moves them around at a quick-enough clip, and makes competent use of the shadowy sets on the way to the obligatory just-when-you-thought-it-was-done ending.With an overbearing score, “Breaking In” telegraphs almost everything that happens yet still provides several jolts amid its occasionally questionable twists.

They have no political opinions or intellectual passions, their sex lives are almost nonexistent, and their parties rarely get out of hand. At Decatur, to be “Life of the Party” (which is the instantly forgettable title of this almost equally unmemorable campus comedy) is to clear a pretty low bar.Still, since the title refers to Melissa McCarthy — a producer and co-writer (with her husband, Ben Falcone, who directed) — there is a measure of liveliness at least. Ms. McCarthy plays Deanna, who finds herself, somewhere in her 40s, suddenly divorced and enrolled at Decatur, where her daughter, Maddie (Molly Gordon), happens to be a senior. Deanna gave up her dreams of studying archaeology to raise Maddie and endure wedlock to a guy named Dan, played by Matt Walsh.Mr. Walsh is one of several fine comic performers without much to do. (Julie Bowen, Stephen Root and Gillian Jacobs are among the others.) Only the great Maya Rudolph, as Deanna’s best friend, manages to spike the artificially sweetened lemonade mix she is handed. But everyone seems game and eager to please, and happy to be working with Ms. McCarthy.VideoThe director Ben Falcone narrates a sequence from his film featuring Melissa McCarthy, his wife.Published OnMay 11, 2018CreditCreditHopper Stone/Warner Bros.In feature films, she tends to play people whose inner wildness is either triumphantly unleashed (“Spy,” say) or was never leashed to begin with (see “The Heat”). Deanna is the first kind, sort of. The zaniness is pretty low-key, and what we witness is less the explosion of pent-up energy than the gentle affirmation of exuberant kindness. Maddie and her friends almost immediately accept Deanna as one of their own, a big sister whose awkward moments are easily laughed off or smoothed over. Deanna also has a mopey, gothy roommate (Heidi Gardner) and attracts a pair of mean-girl bullies.Who aren’t really all that mean, to tell the truth. It is curious to see a comedy so timid, so reluctant to risk hurt feelings or complicated situations. “Life of the Party” may represent Hollywood’s incomprehension — or fear — of young people, whose pursuit of decency seems to be freaking out a lot of grown-ups these days.So the kids write their term papers and throw their tame ragers, while the parents claim the right to act out. The boldest and funniest thread in “Life of the Party” has to do with Deanna’s hot-pants romance with a hunky oenophile frat boy named Jack (Luke Benward). Their relationship — which is sweet, funny and kind of hot — sets up the movie’s single moment of comic sublimity, which I will leave unspoiled.Except to note that it works purely at the level of plot, rather than involving any jokes or physical gags. When a crucial and surprising bit of information about Jack is disclosed, the audience at my screening erupted in sustained laughter that drowned out the dialogue onscreen for almost a full minute. We probably weren’t missing much, though, since the writing and direction had been (and would continue to be) slack and scattershot. Why go back to school after all those years and settle for a gentleman’s C?"

In 1970 he helped found Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan, an invaluable movie house and resource that’s the closest thing to Henri Langlois’s seminal Cinémathèque Française to emerge on American soil.“I Had Nowhere to Go,” a film directed by the artist Douglas Gordon, is based on Mr. Mekas’s diaries, published in 1991 under the same name. (Mr. Gordon is possibly best known in this country for his 1993 art installation “24 Hour ‘Psycho,’” which slowed Alfred Hitchcock’s famous work to a duration of, well, take a guess.) Mr. Gordon does not focus on Mr. Mekas’s career; the movie’s interest is in Jonas Mekas the displaced person who was imprisoned by Nazis in a labor camp in his native Lithuania, then shuttled around Europe before immigrating to the United States and settling in New York.Long portions of the film have the screen black as Mr. Mekas, who is 95, reads from his book; sometimes its color shifts from black to white, from white to gray; at times a field of red fills the screen. Shots of potatoes, or of feet trudging through the snow, punctuate the absence of imagery.Sometimes a silence descends over the black screen, and then Mr. Gordon puts a loud explosion on the soundtrack, a symbol of the war Mr. Mekas spent his early years trying to flee. The effect is startling, and consistently so. But what it conveys is not so much Mr. Mekas’s experience as Mr. Gordon’s will, and his cheap sadistic hostility to the audience. It makes this film a vexed experience."

Unfortunately, as a result, Lu sometimes feels more like a cynical plot device than a character. The problem is only amplified by the animation itself. The character renderings feel more rushed than the rich, warm backgrounds. What the film gains in energy, it loses in the kinds of expressive details that make two-dimensional figures seem like they breathe three-dimensional life. The mermaids in “Lu Over the Wall” can grow legs, but their appeal never rises above the amphibian."

It was the sort of performance that could break out a young actor.But the experience of working with Kubrick gave Mr. Vitali other ideas. Intrigued by Kubrick’s exacting and innovative methods — for example, shooting “Barry Lyndon” as much as possible with candles, torches and sunlight — Mr. Vitali set off to study the craft of moviemaking. His quest led him back to Kubrick, just as the director was starting to work on his 1980 film, “The Shining.” In short order, Mr. Vitali became a casting consultant (he auditioned child actors for the role of Danny Torrance) and then a factotum for Kubrick. In “Filmworker,” a documentary directed by Tony Zierra, Mr. Vitali tells his story.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018Now almost 70, Mr. Vitali is still Mick Jagger skinny. What’s left of his blond hair is set off by a bandanna, and his voice is laid-back but definite, with an ingratiating hint of a rasp. The portrait he creates of his former boss reveals a man of great curiosity, generosity and creativity, but also a frequently imperious and unreasonably demanding perfectionist.Given the relative scarcity of footage of Kubrick at work, Mr. Zierra concocts animated re-creations of confrontations between Mr. Vitali and the filmmaker. Matthew Modine, the star of Kubrick’s 1987 movie, “Full Metal Jacket,” describes Mr. Vitali’s 24/7 devotion to Kubrick as “a self-crucifixion.” But Mr. Vitali himself is very clear on an important point. “I wanted to be with Stanley, to work with Stanley,” he says. “I wanted to.”The material about Kubrick’s process is finally more interesting than the discussions about his temperament. Addressing Kubrick’s mania for multiple takes, Mr. Vitali observes that the filmmaker did not ask for them because of dissatisfaction with his actors, but because he needed to break down a scene, observe how it was or was not coming together, before he could ever abandon it. Kubrick himself had trouble deeming any work truly finished.Today, almost 20 years after Kubrick’s death, the film shows that Mr. Vitali’s work is not over. As a consultant to the Kubrick estate, he does quality control for the video releases of his old boss’s films, and more."

The music, primarily classical selections performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra, is more successful than the voice-over as it supports the images and heightens the tension in the most intimidating scenes.“Sherpa,” Ms. Peedom’s previous film, took a traditional approach to documentary when she chronicled Everest exploration and the guides who work with climbers. After that film ended, its details lingered in the mind. “Mountain” is the flip side of a similar subject, and an intentionally ephemeral experience.

All of the characters apparently exist in a vast, depopulated railway station where a limping janitor (Mike Myers) shuffles among them whistling “Danny Boy.” Somewhere above, an unseen voyeur watches on banks of television screens, his disembodied voice adding another layer of cringeworthy idiocy.Featuring more twists than a 1960s dance marathon, “Terminal” is a flashy, hyperstylized bore. Painted in Day-Glo colors and shot in less than a month in Budapest, the movie has a stagy stiffness that grows more irritating by the minute.

That’s a testament to a lead actor whose performance rings emotionally true despite a good-hearted script that can seem a stretch.That actor, John Carroll Lynch, stars as Early, a quiet insurance man in small-town Mississippi who has been waylaid by the death of his wife of 26 years. Nearly unable to cope with the loss, he moves to Los Angeles to stay with his sister, Laurette (Maura Tierney), and her family, then rents an apartment of his own in Hollywood.Fish-out-of-water scenarios are a dime a dozen, and “Anything” has a dollar to spare. This strait-laced widower is at first baffled then won over by his quirky, big-city neighbors, particularly Freda (Matt Bomer), a transgender woman who earns money through prostitution. Their relationship is the core of the story as the two bond over their mutual loneliness.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018The director Timothy McNeil based the script on his stage play and it shows, sometimes for the better. The conversations are sincere, and the humor low-key. Yet several plot points tend toward the contrived and would likely be more believable onstage, with the special intimacy that theater can afford.Still, Mr. Lynch remains convincing, particularly at the start as he struggles with his pain; in those moments Mr. McNeil works as smartly with silences as he does with words. Later scenes between Mr. Lynch and Mr. Bomer generate some surprising compassion.It’s easy to second-guess a scene or three in “Anything.” Yet this is a film that wagers you’ll put aside your doubts and open up to its gentle emotions. It’s a bit of a risk for a viewer. But I’d take it."

SCOTT","Review: ‘The Day After’ and the Awkwardness of Lunch With the Boss","A tiny Seoul publishing house is the scene of questionable workplace conduct in Hong Sang-soo’s latest comedy of boozy bad manners.","2018-05-09",NA,"2018-05-31 16:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/movies/the-day-after-review-hong-sang-soo.html,Read the New York Times Review of The Day After,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/11/arts/11dayafter-print/11dayafter-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Bongwan (Kwon Hae-hyo), a respected literary critic, runs a small publishing house in Seoul. So small, indeed, that he seems to have only one employee at a time, a young woman with whom Bongwan can be expected to test the boundaries of appropriate behavior. He had an affair with Changsook (Kim Sae-byeok), who left the company. Her replacement, Areum (Kim Min-hee), has a disconcerting first day on the job, which includes a long, boozy lunch, some prying questions from her employer and a visit from his wife (Cho Yun-hee), who mistakes her for Changsook.A lot more happens in “The Day After” — though since this is a film by Hong Sang-soo, you could also say that nothing much happens at all — but this brief summary hints at a certain timeliness. Surely Bongwan, with his potentially toxic blend of vanity, self-pity, passivity and guile, fits the profile of a recognizable and infamous type of lousy media man. But it’s not as if his actions represent anything new in the world, or in Mr. Hong’s films, which are studies in poor judgment and emotional irresponsibility, a lot of it male.“The Day After,” one of three films this prolific director brought to festivals in 2017 (another one screened in Berlin in February), is an especially elegant presentation of some of his characteristic concerns. Shot in chilly, silky digital black and white, it plays with chronology in a way that seems both casual and musically precise. While most of the action takes place during Areum’s first day, her encounters with Bongwan — mostly drinking and eating across a low table at the office or in an empty restaurant — are intercut with similar scenes of Bongwan and Changsook. These feel less like flashbacks than like record skips, morsels of evidence in support of a philosophical argument about the non-linearity of time.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018It is always the present, which means that every moment pivots between hope and regret. When Changsook shows up for real — that is, in the same time frame as Areum — her arrival is almost cosmically startling, as if the rules of the universe have been suddenly rewritten.But the patterns of human interaction admit no such alteration. The weather may change — at one point it starts to snow — but people have a harder time. Rather than force his characters into moments of acute discomfort, Mr. Hong lets them amble toward awkwardness, talking in circles and commonplaces until their rage, need, embarrassment and loneliness bubble to the surface.Bongwan, his mouth alternating between a deep frown and an anxious half-smile, claims our attention as if he were entitled to it. He is used to being listened to, and to getting what he wants, but he also has a bumbling, earnest diffidence that can be charming. On his way to lunch with Areum, he proposes that they address each other informally. He’ll call her by her first name. She asks if she should do the same. “You can call me Boss,” he says, with only the tiniest hint of self-awareness. He also seems unable to grasp the mess he has made of his personal life, retreating to lawyerly evasions when confronted with the consequences of his infidelity.But his chief delusion may be that he’s the protagonist of this film. Mr. Kwon is in nearly every frame, and his voice dominates most of the conversations, but Bongwan’s off-the-rack narcissism is less the subject of “The Day After” than its occasion. It’s not really about him, but about what the women in his life might do — who they might be — without having to attend to his ego. Each of them, in particular Areum, exerts a subtle, centrifugal pull on the film, as if they could break free from Mr. Hong’s tight compositions and drawn-out scenes, and somehow start again."

Ms. Driver’s last feature, “When Pigs Fly,” was made over two decades ago. She does not direct all that often, instead involving herself behind the scenes in the work of Jim Jarmusch, also her partner in life.But the short filmography of this New York-based artist is more distinctive than the aggregated accomplishments of many who are more prolific. Consider Ms. Driver’s 1981 Paul Bowles adaptation, “You Are Not I,” long thought lost and rediscovered several years ago. This tale of madness does an intense double Dutch between art and genre modes, without ever breaking an aesthetic sweat.That Ms. Driver’s new picture, “Boom For Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat,” is a documentary ought not to dissuade anyone hungry for this filmmaker’s voice. While, in many respects, it is conventional in form, alternating archival footage from the late 1970s and early ’80s with newly shot interviews, the movie has a momentum (aided by an exemplary soundtrack of songs from the era) and a rare interrogatory spirit.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018As the film’s title announces, Ms. Driver’s subject is Jean-Michel Basquiat, an artist who died in 1988, at 27, yet who still produced a galvanic body of work. The movie shows that he first attracted notice for his street art, in the persona of “Samo.” (As a collaborator of his points out, this is a contraction of “same old,” as in “same old” you know what.) But Basquiat was not a graffiti artist as such, and the documentary does not cast his experiments in multidisciplinary art as a careerist strategy (this in spite of the fact that his personal charm made him a natural self-promoter). Rather, it depicts the young Basquiat interacting with a specific environment and making it his laboratory.That environment is, of course, the somewhat desolate, dangerous Lower East Side of the late ’70s. There have been an awful lot of recent documentaries lauding the glories of this particular “old” New York, but Ms. Driver’s evocation of it is smart and seductive without being reductively nostalgic. Both she and Mr. Jarmusch, as well as their friend the writer Luc Sante, were beginning their careers at this time, and onscreen, Mr. Sante and Mr. Jarmusch contribute observations both amusing and evocative.Ms. Driver also interviews Basquiat’s friends, lovers and collaborators, and while she shows a good deal of archival footage of the man himself — beautiful, with a lot of droll hairstyles — she withholds one thing: You never hear his voice. Basquiat’s presence in the film is more spectral as a result. This is Ms. Driver’s way of acknowledging loss. Basquiat’s art — raw, inventive, socially engaged — continues to speak to us even as the artist himself cannot.Near the end of the movie, one of Basquiat’s friends refers to him as “a true investigator.” In Ms. Driver, the artist finds a kindred spirit, a fellow investigator who pays him proper and enthralling tribute."

But by the end of “Always at the Carlyle,” which is more interested in burnishing a reputation than in exploring it, the introduction seems to operate more like the ill-advised topic sentence for this superficial love letter.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018Discretion may be a virtue in the upscale hospitality business, but not in documentary film. If you are going to make a movie that hints at scandal and celebrity gossip and behind-the-scenes glamour, then it’s not too much to ask that some secrets be revealed and a glass or two of juice poured. Instead, the movie’s director, Matthew Miele, collects an impressive amount of talent, including actors (George Clooney, Anjelica Huston), supermodels (Naomi Campbell) and journalists (Graydon Carter), who wax poetic about the hotel’s Art Deco style, Old World ambience and white glove treatment favored by the rich and famous.Every once in a while, someone hints at a great story — like the time Michael Jackson, Steve Jobs and Princess Diana shared an elevator — but it’s all setup, no punch line. Is it worth even mentioning that Lucille Ball was chewing gum in the hallway? When Piers Morgan says the hotel “oozes class,” is that really the best way to get this point across? Much is made of a story about how John F. Kennedy smuggled Marilyn Monroe through a tunnel to the Carlyle, but then the idea is pretty convincingly debunked. So, again, why bother?An alternative route might have been a more investigative, serious profile that examines how a Polish-born banker, Moses Ginsberg, created the hotel in an image of old New York elitism. The focus on Bobby Short, the cabaret star who regularly played the Café Carlyle, helps.The Carlyle’s entertainment options do transport you to another time. I once saw Mort Sahl perform there with a newspaper in hand, just as he did in the 1950s. And while the documentary hints at how this rarefied reputation was constructed and developed, it is far more focused on familiar faces and promotional adjectives. At one point, the chef and CNN host Anthony Bourdain calls the Carlyle “completely nuts.” I believe him — and would love to see the movie that actually makes the case."

The basic plot — a woman collecting payback from the men who have assaulted her — is not exactly new, and it’s a conceit that can be used as an alibi. The way a movie like this often goes is that the audience is invited to revel in the spectacle of sexual violence and also in the violent punishment that follows. Misogyny is indulged so it can be condemned, and vice versa.Coralie Fargeat, making an impressive, uncompromising feature-directing debut, sets out to avoid that trap, or at least to build a better one. “Revenge” begins at a high pitch of travel porn and commodity fetishism. A helicopter alights near a luxurious modernist villa in the desert (possibly in Mexico, though the end credits say Morocco), disgorging a guy (Kevin Janssens) with accessories that identify him as one of life’s winners: a chunky watch, a gym-carved physique and a young girlfriend (Matilda Lutz) who suggestively tongues a lollipop as she peeps through candy-colored sunglasses.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018Her name is Jen. Her companion, Richard, is married to someone else. He speaks French. She might be American. In any case, the camera observes her according to time-honored cinematic conventions: from behind at a low angle as she walks around in her underwear or a bathing suit. When Richard’s hunting buddies, Stan (Vincent Colombe) and Dimitri (Guillaume Bouchède), show up, they regard her in the same way. But everyone seems to be having a good time. The male gaze never hurt anyone, right? There’s a big TV, a good sound system, an infinity pool. Some guns, too, but those are for later.Things turn ugly pretty fast. The men reveal their true predatory colors. First Stan, who rapes Jen; then Dimitri, who ignores the assault; and finally Richard, who proves to be the worst bro in the bunch. There follows a long working out of the film’s title, as Jen transforms herself from victim to warrior and Ms. Fargeat turns her skills to suspense and gore. There is a lot of that, as male flesh is mangled by bullets, blades and broken glass.Some of this is played for gruesome comedy, especially in the extended climactic showdown. Realism is not much of a concern. Jen’s survival, while neither supernatural nor superhuman, nonetheless grants her a quasi-mythic status. Gravely wounded, she heals herself with some peyote, a cigarette lighter, a hunting knife and an empty beer can. The logo leaves a symbolic tattoo across her abdomen.And “Revenge” leaves a lurid, punchy afterimage, an impression somewhere between righteous delight and quivering revulsion. It’s both a challenge and a calling card, in which Ms. Fargeat at once exposes what’s wrong with her chosen genre and demonstrates her mastery of it."
"3520","The Seagull","PG-13",0,"A.O.

There is very little Ms. Bening can’t do, but one of the things she does best is play actresses — the title character in “Being Julia,” Gloria Grahame in “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool” and now Chekhov’s diva of the late-19th-century Moscow stage. Irina is charming and silly, imperious and intelligent, tough to the point of cruelty and also exquisitely sensitive. Her brother’s country estate, where nearly all of the drama takes place, is a hive of shifting loyalty, jealousy and desire, dominated by Irina’s grand and difficult personality.Ms. Bening may be the straw that stirs this particular drink, but she is hardly the only marvel in a cast that includes Corey Stoll (as Irina’s lover, the celebrated writer Boris Trigorin), Brian Dennehy (as Sorin, Irina’s perpetually dying brother) and Elisabeth Moss (as the cynical and lovelorn Masha, daughter of the estate manager). Supplying the requisite notes of youthful ardor are Billy Howle, as Irina’s melancholy son, Konstantin, and Saoirse Ronan, as Nina, the young neighbor he tormentedly loves. (Mr. Howle and Ms. Ronan are also paired in Dominic Cooke’s “On Chesil Beach,” which opens next week).If Shakespeare tends to goad modern performers toward displays of shoulder-swinging actorishness, Chekhov often has a contrary, admirably humbling effect. His psychology is so acute, his language so supple and sharp, that his work calls forth low-key intelligence instead of high-toned magniloquence. The characters in “The Seagull” are vain, sometimes miserable creatures, but they are also aware of the comical aspects of their existence. There is gravity — even tragedy — in their circumstances, but nothing heavy about the play itself. It holds its shape like a perfect soufflé, rich and airy, simple and yet the product of miraculous technique.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 30, 2018The recipe is there, on the page. (The playwright Stephen Karam, author of “The Humans,” wrote the screenplay). The human ingredients are neatly assembled. But somehow, the execution fails. What is that strange, discordant flavor? What is the source of the alternately gritty and gloppy texture?The answer, in a word, is cinema. Not something I’m against by any means, but something Mr. Mayer, whose previous features are “A Home at the End of the World” and “Flicka,” ladles onto “The Seagull” like gravy from a school-cafeteria tub. An able theatrical director (his Broadway credits include “Spring Awakening” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”), Mr. Mayer overwhelms the play with incessant camera movements, busily zooming and swooping through the sets, disrupting scenes with hectic, inexplicable rhythms.At one point, during a crucial and intense confrontation between Irina and her son, the camera cuts from one to the other almost 30 times, at odd angles and apparently random intervals. The effect is like being nudged by the patron in the next seat or waved at from across the theater. When you should be immersed, you are distracted. When you should be hanging on Irina and Konstantin’s every angry, tender, scalding word, your attention is bounced around like a tennis ball.Is this a catastrophe? No. “The Seagull,” as you hardly needed me to tell you, remains a masterpiece, a pungent and permanently modern anatomy of the conflicting pursuits of fame, art, love and happiness. Ms. Bening, Ms. Moss and Ms. Ronan in particular are superb, as you also probably didn’t need me to tell you. Each one finds the individuality that Chekhov, with uncanny sympathy and sly gallantry, imparted to his female characters. The cast is great. The play is great. But this is still a bad movie, because it has no clear or coherent idea of how to be one."

Mia (Wen Qi), the young protagonist of “Angels Wear White,” a searing movie written and directed by Vivian Qu, almost immediately establishes a one-girl counter to this notion. The viewer’s first glimpse of her is ordinary enough.At the beach in a South China town, she stands under a giant sculpture, unseen in its entirety but clearly of a woman. Mia examines the ankles, the high shoes, the red toenail polish. Then it’s off to work, at a motel called “Warmness.” Her immediate supervisor is an older teenager named Lily, who glams herself up to impress her sometime boyfriend, the petty criminal Jian.Lily has Mia cover for her as receptionist. One guest is a middle-aged man with two schoolgirls in tow. One of them is wearing a blond wig. They check into separate rooms, and the girls order beer delivered to theirs. The next day at school, one of the girls has bruises on the inside of her thigh.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018“Angels Wear White” is plotted like a suspense thriller. While the motel’s unctuous sleazeball manager insists to the authorities that his security footage is wiped every couple of days, Mia has captured evidence with her phone. She also has that blond wig stashed away.Mia is in a jam herself. She has no official identification and figures some blackmail might earn her the money to buy a card. In this respect, she’s resourceful, but as it turns out, she’s also terribly naïve. She tries to do business with the puffed-up phony Jian even though she knows he is eager to pimp her out.Many of the characters, with the exception of the child legal advocate Hao, are up to their necks in squalid corruption. The child rapist is a government big shot with a lot of money. He offers to pay the private school tuition of one of his victims, so long as the family doesn’t sue. Lily and Mia are trapped by the motel manager in a form of indentured servitude, and Lily is so desperate in her relationship with Jian that she submits to hymen-reconstruction surgery.This all sounds grim, and it is. But the story grabs you. Ms. Qu shoots the sturdily constructed scenario with unshowy sharpness. Film critics and viewers in the West tend to sentimentalize feel-good movies from the East, delighting in their ostensible universality. The moral rot and callous corruption depicted in “Angels Wear White” has a particularly bracing effect in part because, cultural specifics aside, the inhumanity on display is hardly alien.Mia is a poignant character. Near the end of the movie, she tells Hao that she drifted to the town because it’s so warm that even if you’re homeless you can sleep outside. The matter-of-fact way that Ms. Wen delivers this observation is heartbreaking. So is the ultimate reveal of the giant sculpture, a metaphoric angel — instantly recognizable in the West — wearing white."

For almost half a century, he’s been weaving this quirk into poignant romantic fables, often galvanized by offbeat casting decisions that add unexpected layers to whatever story he’s telling.“Ray Meets Helen” is his 22nd film (the first since 2003’s “The Secret Lives of Dentists”), and his sixth with the actor Keith Carradine. As Ray, a broken-down boxer forced to quit at his peak because of a hand injury, Mr. Carradine moves with an aching sense of regret. Without money or prospects, he can scarcely believe his luck when an armored-truck accident virtually deposits cash in his lap. Maybe now he can mend fences with his ex-wife, Ginger (Jennifer Tilly), a voluble floozy who has long since moved on.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018Spying on Ginger one night, Ray encounters Helen (Sondra Locke), a destitute farmer who has come to Los Angeles to borrow money. She, too, has had a sudden windfall, inheriting the apartment and lifestyle of a wealthy barfly (Samantha Mathis) who has killed herself. Both she and Ray are playing roles in their own dramas: two lonely, late middle-aged strangers briefly enjoying new, affluent identities. There’s a reason the song “Beautiful Dreamer” features prominently.Comprising multiple, loosely interwoven plot threads united as much by the characters’ lyrical speech patterns as their end-of-life longings, “Ray Meets Helen” has a wistful, whimsical sophistication that has all but disappeared from movies. Filled with imaginative visuals populated by the ghosts of the gone and hopes for the future, the movie is wonderfully, magically humane.“I’m the only true romantic left in this building,” Ginger announces at one point. She forgot about her director."

(See, for example, her work as a weed enthusiast in desperate search of a stash in 2007’s “Smiley Face.”) Eugenio Derbez is a wildly popular Mexican comedic performer making inroads in the U.S.; his 2017 effort in this campaign, “How to Be a Latin Lover” was at its best an amiably amusing trifle in which Mr. Derbez was the main laugh generator.So building a gender-reversed remake of the 1987 film “Overboard” — at that time a lively vehicle for Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell — around Ms. Faris and Mr. Derbez is not a deplorable notion on the face of it. The original is, after all, well-liked but not quite revered, so there’s little risk of sacrilege. The resultant movie, directed by Rob Greenberg from a script Mr. Greenberg and Bob Fisher adapted from Leslie Dixon’s original story, is not deplorable either. At first, it’s just kind of flat, from the writing to the lighting.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018Ms. Faris plays Kate, a single mom in coastal Oregon working two jobs and studying for a nursing exam. Assigned to clean the carpet on a docked yacht, she at first banters with, then alienates, the snotty Mexican playboy Leonardo Montenegro, the ne’er-do-well son of the third richest man in the world. Their confrontation costs Kate her gig and puts her in debt for some expensive cleaning equipment. When Leonardo falls off his yacht and washes to shore without memory, Kate’s boss and gal pal Theresa (Eva Longoria) encourages Kate to claim the amnesiac as her husband and make him work for her.Leonardo (dubbed “Leo” by Kate and her three daughters) soon discovers the man he never was, and never even considered being: a hard-working breadwinner, a loving dad, an ever-improving cook. (The small construction crew with which Kate has arranged a job for him is mostly Latin American; one noteworthy feature of the movie is that about a third of its dialogue is in Spanish.) None of the proceedings are sidesplittingly funny, but they grow increasingly sweet-natured. The most remarkable aspect of this movie is its perhaps unwitting gentleness. The meanest joke in the movie concerns the lack of musical ability of one of Leonardo’s siblings.A colleague remarked, as we were exiting the screening, that perhaps right now is not the worst time to spend a couple of hours with a movie that’s pretty much all marshmallow. I can’t entirely disagree, conceptually, but before you make your decision, consider the fact that this remake actually makes the innocuous original look edgy by comparison."

So let’s play along with this fantasy (for a bit). When you first meet her character, Marlo, she’s executing the familiar balancing act and juggling a pair of kids — with another one on the way — a husband and a two-story house that looks like it would take hours and hours to vacuum. The golden light that settles on her like a celestial mantle suggests that Marlo’s life is heavenly at least in moments, even if her clenched expression and haunted eyes read more like distress signals.Marlo is doing the contemporary supermom thing and, refreshingly, she isn’t doing it with 1950s clichéd desperate smiles. Directed by Jason Reitman from a script by Diablo Cody (this is their third movie together), “Tully” admits that this figure is a noxious delusion, one that isn’t suitable for real women. Nevertheless they’re made to feel guilty for not doing it all or scolded for trying to live up to impossible standards. And soon enough the golden nimbus surrounding Marlo vanishes, swept away by the reality of hustling two children off to school while waiting for her water to break. (Lia Frankland plays the 8-year-old Sarah; Asher Miles Fallica plays the younger, ambiguously troubled Jonah.)Mr. Reitman, as he does, goes for nice and easy, and everything in “Tully” flows when it doesn’t rush, picking up characters like Marlo’s husband, Drew (Ron Livingston), and her conspicuously wealthier brother, Craig (Mark Duplass). The casting of Mr. Livingston and Mr. Duplass — who look more like brothers than Mr. Duplass and his actual brother, Jay Duplass — plays like a joke without a punch line. All it really suggests is that Marlo, in marrying a less successful version of her brother, has some provocative psychosexual issues that the movie can’t be bothered with, mostly because it’s one of those character-driven stories that reduce personalities to a set of readily defined traits and quirks.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018To wit: Marlo is a quick draw when it comes to deadpan looks and sharp quips, but also, and of course, loving and exceptionally competent. Drew is a bland hard worker who plays video games in bed at night when Marlo crawls under the covers, a pattern that continues after she delivers their third child. Some might smack Drew’s joystick out of his hands and the rest of his sorry self out of bed — Ms. Theron is such a naturally strong presence that it’s hard to believe Marlo would put up with his nonsense. But that would get in the way of the story’s conceit and antediluvian take on gender roles.And so it goes: Marlo cares for the kids while Drew works and plays, occasionally pausing to deliver one of those slightly surprised nice-guy looks that the likable Mr. Livingston has a near patent on: eyebrows gently perturbed, face drained of readable emotion, voice slightly rising as if in innocent protest. Drew and Marlo’s division of labor would be fine if it were equitable. But fairness wouldn’t jibe with the story’s plans for Marlo, much less enlightenment. Her burden is treated as grist for comedy, notably in the repeated images — fluttering like a flip book — of her enduring a lonely maternal crucible as she feeds and diapers the newborn again and again.Marlo is rescued by Tully (Mackenzie Davis from the late, great AMC series “Halt and Catch Fire”), a night nurse whose job is to take over for exhausted mothers, allowing them much-needed sleep. Ms. Davis is a sparky, charismatic performer, and, much like her character, she whooshes into the story, infusing it with energy and scattering good vibes like a punk Tinker Bell. Under her caretaker’s attentive, adamant watch, Marlo again starts to smile, re-entering the world of the living. She brightens and so does “Tully,” which morphs into a female-friendship movie, complete with a nostalgic girls-wanna-have fun playlist calculated for maximum audience head-bobbing.Ms. Theron and Ms. Davis make a pleasurable, watchable pair — Ms. Davis is obviously happy to be the moon to Ms. Theron’s sun — but “Tully” isn’t really interested in the sustaining joys of female bonding. It has a message to deliver, which is as sincere and decent as it is obvious: Mothers need help, sometimes serious help. Which is why it’s strange that as Marlo very visibly sinks into postpartum depression — you can see Ms. Theron pulling Marlo deeper and deeper inside — the movie pretends that her burden is somehow too hidden for anyone to notice. Much like her useless husband, it isolates Marlo, and once again it is a woman who’s the problem that needs solving."

For more than three decades, in the same nondescript department, she has processed applications for voter-identification cards. With metronomic efficiency, she checks documents and unspools red tape before returning to her drab apartment and beloved cat — her sole companion.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018Aside from Doña’s daily subway rides and occasional, unnerving glimpses of the city at night, “Everything Else” unfolds in a closed loop of office, apartment and a public pool where Doña silently watches children swim. The film’s discipline and quotidian dreariness can be wearying. Yet between Ms. Barraza’s impressive performance and Lorenzo Hagerman’s beautifully textured photography (he also shot Rick Alverson’s “Entertainment,” another hyper-focused study of psychological pain), the story’s tragedy gradually accumulates.A portrait of extreme isolation, “Everything Else” is also a movie about women, their bodies crammed together in subway cars and reported, missing or abused, on the evening news. Their comradeship at the pool is a solace that Doña Flor seeks even when she can’t enter the water; and with each cycle of her routines, her actions become merely the bass line of a slow song of awakening. Her barriers are being shaken, not by cataclysm, but by the steady drip of a loneliness that she can no longer abide."

Like the title, it promises a steamy, angsty romance awash in burning rubber, glamorous crimes and designer zippers that won’t stay up — ingredients that virtually arrange themselves into pulp heaven.Not in the hands of the Flemish director Michaël R. Roskam, apparently, who prefers to take a darker, altogether drearier route. Notwithstanding two leads who are easier on the eyes than slices of iced cucumber, the movie appears to go out of its way to prise them apart. Initially, though, it’s all hot-to-trot chemistry as Gino (Matthias Schoenaerts), a cheeky thief, and Bibi (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a professional racecar driver, meet and fall into bed before you can say “Le Mans.” He’s a sloe-eyed, smoky charmer posing as a luxury car dealer; she’s a bodacious daddy’s girl with the kind of choppy non-hairstyle only the very young and beautiful can get away with. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018Set in Brussels and divided into two sections, the movie enjoys a zippy first half structured around Gino’s fun-loving gang of miscreants and a thrilling bank robbery. A bit of business with a shipping container and a security van is handled beautifully by both the director and his cinematographer, Nicolas Karakatsanis, as is a multiple-viewpoint shootout. This section is also adept at sneaking Gino into our sympathies, revealing him to be both damaged and sweet, a victim of a fend-for-himself childhood and reform-school adolescence. Stealing is his high, and, until he meets Bibi, nothing else has come close.Then the director, having shown us his fizz-bang-wallop chops and primed us for more of the same, violently switches gears. What was once a sexy heist movie is now a grim prison drama and disease-of-the-week weepie. For Bibi, it’s no more fast cars and slinky racing onesies; in their place are sweatpants and pallid pining. Poor Gino, for his part, must absorb a veritable aria of punishments, not the least being that conjugal-visit sex is a poor substitute for the outlaw variety. Or so I’m told.The two leads are sensational, but the movie, drained of its life force and stuffed with confusing plot complications — like a shoehorned-in undercover agent and some mysterious Albanians — never recovers. By the end, the real tragedy is not the doomed love affair, but a narrative structure that can’t seem to get out of its way."

To get into the proper contemplative frame of mind, you would need to spend a month walking the Camino de Santiago across Spain, the same journey — a famous Catholic pilgrimage — that its principal subject takes.Dane Johansen, an American cellist, sets out to hike a route that extends from the Pyrenees in the east to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, regarded as the final resting place of St. James, in the west, playing Bach’s suites in 36 ancient churches along the way. The director, Tristan Cook, mingles Mr. Johansen’s reflections with footage of and voice-overs from other travelers (there is semantic parsing over who warrants the designation “pilgrim”), giving some sense of the profundity of the experience.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018We hear about what it feels like to leave everything behind, about impromptu friendships, about how strange urban life seems when the trail leads into a city and even about the dissatisfaction that can ensue at the end.Still, “Strangers on the Earth” raises questions about how it was made, and even whether making it defeats the inherent asceticism of the project. Presumably having a camera on you at least part of the time is disruptive to the mood. (Are the filmmakers hiking as well?) And “Strangers” could have spent more time with Mr. Johansen’s music instead of hurrying to each successive destination."

One is killed immediately, while the other 10 endure torture first on their way to death, a fate that surely awaits Jan if he fails to reach neutral Sweden. He starts his flight on foot, limping from the initial skirmish after losing a toe to a stray bullet. As Jan slowly makes his way to the border, he is pursued relentlessly by a high-ranking Nazi officer, Kurt Stage (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), even as frostbite and gangrene force Jan to rely ever more on the protection of friendly Norwegians. In “The 12th Man,” escape is a matter of endurance.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018In his direction of Jan’s exodus, Harald Zwart lingers on the Arctic Circle location of this hero’s ordeal. The mountainous borderlands bring the threat of extremities lost to cold, the challenge of crossing streams when the touch of water might chill you for days. Sleds and sleighs become vehicles of guerrilla warfare; reindeer are fashioned into allies; daring escapes are made on skis. The reward of Mr. Zwart’s attention to the unique details of this historical account is that Jan’s path to safety frequently shocks, offering scenes of defiance that are unfamiliar or unexpected. In a familiar genre, “The 12th Man” preserves the element of surprise by understanding its terrain."
"3619","RBG","PG",0,"A.O. SCOTT","Review: In ‘RBG,’ the Life and Times of a Beloved and Controversial Supreme Court Justice","How Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the second woman named to the Supreme Court and the first justice to become a pop-culture phenomenon.","2018-05-03","2018-05-04","2018-06-03 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/movies/rbg-review-documentary.html,Read the New York Times Review of RBG,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/arts/04rbg/04rbg-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the second woman appointed to the United States Supreme Court, but she’s probably the first justice to become a full-fledged pop-cultural phenomenon. “RBG,” a loving and informative documentary portrait of Justice Ginsburg during her 85th year on earth and her 25th on the bench, is both evidence of this status and a partial explanation of how it came about.Directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, the film is a jaunty assemblage of interviews, public appearances and archival material, organized to illuminate its subject’s temperament and her accomplishments so far. Though it begins with audio snippets of Justice Ginsburg’s right-wing detractors — who see her as a “demon,” a “devil” and a threat to America — “RBG” takes a pointedly high road through recent political controversies. Its celebration of Justice Ginsburg’s record of progressive activism and jurisprudence is partisan but not especially polemical. The filmmakers share her convictions and assume that the audience will, too.Which might be true, and not only because much of the audience is likely to consist of liberals. Before she was named to the federal bench by Jimmy Carter in 1980, the future justice had argued a handful of important sex-discrimination cases in front of the Supreme Court. What linked these cases — she won five out of six — was the theory that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment should apply to women and could be used to remedy discrepancies in hiring, business practices and public policy.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018The idea that women are equal citizens — that barring them from certain jobs and educational opportunities and treating them as the social inferiors of men are unfair — may not seem especially controversial now. “RBG” uses Justice Ginsburg’s own experiences to emphasize how different things were not so long ago. At Harvard Law School, she was one of nine women in a class of hundreds, and was asked by the dean (as all the women were) why she thought she deserved to take what should have been a man’s place.The biographical part of “RBG” tells a story that is both typical and exceptional. It’s a reminder that the upward striving of first- and second-generation Jewish immigrants in the middle decades of the 20th century was accompanied by fervent political idealism. Justice Ginsburg’s career was marked by intense intellectual ambition and also by a determination to use the law as an instrument of change.The film also chronicles her marriage to Martin Ginsburg. They met as undergraduates at Cornell, and for the next 63 years, Mr. Ginsburg (who died in 2010) was his wife’s tireless supporter and champion, a man whose commitment to domestic egalitarianism was extraordinary in his time and far from common today. As their friends and children explain — and as Mr. Ginsburg, a New York tax lawyer, often said himself — he was responsible for cooking meals and cracking jokes while she was making history. He also, when Byron White retired from the Supreme Court, made sure that her name was high on President Clinton’s list of candidates.It would be fascinating to learn more about that campaign, and also to have a finer-grained sense of the institutional and interpersonal dynamics of the court over the past quarter-century. But “RBG” reasonably chooses to focus on Justice Ginsburg herself, and relishes every moment of her company. It also shows why she has become such an inspiration for younger feminists, like Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik, whose 2015 book “Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg” helped created the contemporary image of a fierce, uncompromising and gracious champion of women’s rights.That those rights are in a new phase of embattlement goes without saying. The movie’s touch is light and its spirit buoyant, but there is no mistaking its seriousness or its passion. Those qualities resonate powerfully in the dissents that may prove to be Justice Ginsburg’s most enduring legacy, and “RBG” is, above all, a tribute to her voice."

He learns about Bigfoot’s special powers, which include the abilities to heal with touch and to talk to animal friends, principally a bear, two raccoons, a woodpecker and a chipmunk.

A road movie of sorts, it steers clear of melodrama or sentimentality, but it also never risks hitting anything.To be fair, such restraint may be intended as a reflection of the protagonist, Teresa (the Chilean actress Paulina García, who earned raves a few years ago for the film “Gloria”), who has spent more than half her life working unassumingly as a maid in Buenos Aires. As “The Desert Bride” opens, she is shown walking with a group along a desert road, after a bird has damaged the windshield of their bus.

The religious and mystical associations of this Western Argentine region are noted periodically, perhaps to a greater extent than the payoff requires.Ms. Atán and Ms. Pivato frequently film their stars at a slight distance, as if afraid to get too close.

We barely hear a shot or a shell, and news of the horror of trench warfare — the story starts in 1915 — reaches us mostly through the words of men who have returned, briefly, from the front. Brothers, husbands, sons, these soldiers show up one at a time, unannounced, to their home in a rustic valley somewhere in France. And then they go away again, sometimes forever.The battlefield might be on the other side of the world, or it might be a few miles away. This is a society where communication happens by letter, newspaper and word of mouth, where time moves slowly. On the Paridier family farm, life continues according to ancient agricultural rhythms, a daily round of chores and a seasonal cycle of tilling, planting and harvesting. With the able-bodied men off fighting, the work is left to the women, the guardians (in French, the title uses the feminine form of the noun) of tradition, honor and continuity.The matriarch is Hortense (Nathalie Baye), who stoically and ably runs the household with her daughter, Solange (Laura Smet, who is Ms. Baye’s real-life daughter). Hortense’s two sons, Constant (Nicolas Giraud) and Georges (Cyril Descours), and her son-in-law, Clovis (Olivier Rabourdin), are away, and while the women miss them terribly, “The Guardians” also suggests that life without everyday male domination has its upsides. The only man on hand is Hortense’s husband, Henri (Gilbert Bonneau), who is too old for farm labor and too gentle to boss anyone around.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 24, 2018When Constant and Georges are home — especially Georges, the more arrogant brother — they pick up authority as if it were a coat they had left hanging on a hook near the door, unaware that their mother and sister had been wearing it perfectly well. But Hortense and Solange don’t complain, either about the extra work that falls to them when the men are absent or the power dynamics when they’re around.Directed by Xavier Beauvois (“Of Gods and Men”) and adapted from a 1924 novel by Ernest Pérochon, “The Guardians” is a historical drama that doesn’t lose itself in decorative period detail, a beautifully photographed chronicle of rural existence that refrains from picturesque sentimentality and grinding misery, the usual modes for this kind of film. The characters, while they are constrained by customs and expectations that may seem old-fashioned to us, are modern to themselves. They think about the world and their places in it, look to the future with optimism and trepidation, and experience freedom within the constraints of circumstance.In spite of the war, the Paridier farm prospers. Hortense hires Francine (Iris Bry), a young woman raised in a nearby orphanage, to help her and Solange. Francine proves to be both a tireless worker and an amiable presence around the farm. (Ms. Bry, in her first film role, is an exceptional presence onscreen, by turns warm and sharp, innocent and wise.) When Georges comes back on leave, an inevitable spark ignites between them, and the elements of romance and family melodrama overtake the historical narrative.The history is there of course, not only of World War I but also of the technological and social upheavals that accompanied it. Within a few years, the Paridier women upgrade from a horse-drawn plow to a McCormick combine harvester to a gas-powered tractor. Other, less immediately noticeable changes are underway, having to do with relations between men and women and between citizens and the state.At the center is a family crisis involving the three women. Hortense, in particular, is confronted with an ethical dilemma that subtly and powerfully reframes our understanding of her and of the story as a whole. Ms. Baye, one of the great living French screen actresses, is steely and magnificent, even as it is Ms. Bry who finally captures the film’s energy and the sympathy of the audience. It turns out that Francine and Hortense, with equal determination, are guarding two different ideals and that the true, endless war into which they are conscripted is between the past and the future."

The intrusion drives Cale to go into supervillain mode, methodically destroying Sean’s life while continuing to toy with the woman he’s kidnapped.The story line, not to mention the trappings of wealth, make the movie feel a bit like a tribute to the cheesy deluxe-house-of-guilty-mirrors thrillers of the ’80s and ’90s — “Jagged Edge,” “Fatal Attraction” and so on. The “Bad Samaritan” director, Dean Devlin, handles the proceedings like Adrian Lyne (who directed “Fatal Attraction”) on HGH supplements (and divested of over a third of Mr. Lyne’s visual elegance, such as it is).Mr. Tennant, who usually is scrupulous in conveying the nuances of volatile characters (see his work on the British television series “Broadchurch”), just goes utterly bananas here. Particularly in the last 15 minutes when, for reasons perhaps only fully known to himself, he attempts an impersonation of Steve Carell’s character on “The Office.”"

Other Buddhists including Urgain, his godfather, confirmed the signs, and as this documentary opens we see villagers lining up to be blessed by him.Such reverence doesn’t last. After a rinpoche is identified, he is supposed to be retrieved by disciples of his original monastery, and taken there to live. Yet none come for Padma. That monastery is in Tibet, where China has effectively closed the borders. Soon, Padma’s neighbors begin to doubt his holiness.The directors Chang-Yong Moon and Jin Jeon filmed Padma over some eight years, and we watch this adorable child grow distressed as his destiny remains unfulfilled. At 12, he and the steadfast Urgain plan to cross into Tibet and get to Kham.In the second half, what had been a profile of a boy and his village becomes a road movie that is wonderful to watch though sketchy with details; even basic facts on their travels are absent. Conversations, too, are sometimes left without subtitles.Majestic footage makes those omissions easier to overlook: shots of vast mountain ranges are magnificent, while scenes from the pair’s journey are heartwarming. The filmmakers rarely delve into the spiritual aspects of the story, but that’s O.K. You don’t have to believe in Padma and Urgain’s religion to believe in them."

If you share this view, the New York opening of “Rogers Park” ought to be a welcome event.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018Named after the Chicago neighborhood where it is set and was shot, the movie does not make the North Side area a character in and of itself. But the film is scrupulous in its portrayal of a multiethnic, largely progressive community.Its four central characters, two couples united by friendship and blood ties, are decent folk having a hard time finding serenity as middle age and its multiple discontents come breathing down their necks. Grace (Sara Sevigny), who runs a preschool, and her husband, Zeke (Antoine McKay), celebrate a wedding anniversary in the movie’s opening; their good time is spoiled by Grace’s brother, Chris (Jonny Mars), making a toast that turns into a rant. Chris, who has a chip on his shoulder (one that’s too well supplemented by a man bun), is a one-time hot-shot novelist permanently stuck on his second book. His partner, Deena (Christine Horn), a local activist, is getting fed up with him fast. (While both couples are interracial, that doesn’t exacerbate their troubles that we can see; the movie just depicts the unions as plain matters of fact.)There’s a predictable element not just to the movie’s four-seasons structure but also to the story lines themselves. When Zeke takes a risk and buys an underpriced property in the hopes of flipping it for a big chunk of change, one just knows he’s going to learn why the house was such a bargain in the first place. But the screenwriter, Carlos Treviño, crafts frank dialogue and the director, Kyle Henry, films the scenes with an eye for the intimate, dividend-paying gesture. The superb actors, given opportunities to go for broke, make each one count, and make the movie worth watching."

Lurching relentlessly from one conflict to another, the movie distills its emotions — and maintains its momentum — in conversations of remarkably controlled intensity.Many of these exchanges are conducted over the head and behind the back of Ava (a strikingly resolute Mahour Jabbari), a strong-willed teenager in Tehran whose restricted life feels like a vise that’s slowly closing. Bright and fearless, she mutinies gently against the predetermined path that her controlling mother (Bahar Noohian) and oppressive culture have set. Her desires are laughably harmless, studying music and spending time with her best friend, Melody (Shayesteh Sajadi), being the most pressing.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018Yet for Ava and her peers, the admonitions never end. The terrifying teachers in her all-girl high school encourage informers and expound on the evils of overeating and unsanctioned pregnancy. An innocent meeting with a male classmate occasions a march to the gynecologist to affirm her virginity, and Melody’s fractured family is pronounced too shameful to be associated with.Tonally acrid and visually inventive (the wonderful cinematography is by Sina Kermanizadeh), “Ava” looks repression in the eye and doesn’t flinch. As Ava’s desperation grows, her director uses windows and door frames to isolate her from her arguing parents and cliquish classmates. In one long, evocative take, Ava’s parents fight while she moves silently to and fro, unnoticed. She’s only visible when she steps outside the lines; and yet the longer she’s on the screen, the more we fear for her."

Directed by Miguel Arteta, it mostly takes place over a single day and night, and not much happens by conventional movie standards. Two strangers hook up and, while giddily enjoying their postcoital high, decide to try to cram an entire relationship — a world of togetherness — into the next 24 hours. So they talk, eat, drink and talk some more, regularly taking time out to turn each other on.Naima (Alia Shawkat) and Sergio (Laia Costa) have sex every which way, in bed and out, in clothes and out, swept away by desire. They also share other parts of themselves, willingly but also inadvertently — and not necessarily in sync. One cuts loose; the other raises an emotional barrier. Letting it all hang out proves easy for Sergio, a sublimely untalented singer whose free-spirited ways can feel calculated, as when she calms down (and delights) a hostile audience by kissing surprised female patrons. Given that Naima sleeps with her arms crossed and fists clenched, it seems as if she might be immune to Sergio’s charismatic offensive. Not a chance.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018CreditCreditThe OrchardYou might find yourself more resistant to Sergio’s enthusiasms despite Ms. Costa’s energetically earnest performance. Much depends on your tolerance for excitable personalities like Sergio who eagerly turn life into self-aggrandizing drama, as if living their personal truth entails punctuating every sigh and statement with exclamation points. “I want to know you, for real,” Sergio tells Naima while they’re cooking up their 24-hour pact. Someone less stoned on sex might have wondered what “for real” means, might have hit pause. But Naima is wowed and flattered and — as we gradually learn — she has a need that she can’t yet express, even to herself.There’s always a danger when a movie effectively locks you up with two characters so that you experience their every hot breath in squirming, claustrophobic intimacy (like in “Bug” and “Room”). If you don’t fall in love with at least one of the two, your attention can spiral into impatience or stray into indifference. There’s little chance of that in “Duck Butter” because of Ms. Shawkat, an intensely appealing performer who’s a veteran of the TV series “Arrested Development.” In a show crowded with genius, Ms. Shawkat always manages to stand out, partly because you can always see her working the angles even when comically flailing. The same holds true here.In “Duck Butter,” Ms. Shawkat — who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Arteta — creates a character whose consciousness lurches into existence one modest and momentous encounter at a time. Naima labors (struggles) as an actress, and the story clicks in on her first day on an indie production (alongside an amusing Kumail Nanjiani and Lindsay Burdge) being directed by Mark and Jay Duplass. Appearing as themselves, the Duplasses drop in only briefly, but they make a sly, barbed impression — and give the movie a sharp meta-moment — as professional nice guys whose chill vibe instantly evaporates when Naima, with a supreme lack of self-awareness, challenges their authority.Much of “Duck Butter” takes place after Naima’s humiliating experience working with the Duplasses. She more or less runs straight into Sergio’s arms, which can be read as a metaphor for female self-reliance (with tinges of panic and fear) or appreciated as a bit of storytelling expediency. Ms. Shawkat, who also has an executive producer credit here, has appeared in her share of indie productions. She and Mr. Arteta, a sensitive observer of life’s everyday churn (his credits include “Beatriz at Dinner”), do some lovely work in a movie that reminds you that sometimes all you need in realist fiction is a glimpse into another person’s being — but with heart and intelligence, good craft and technique."

It’s painful to see Ms. Dolezal, whose legal name is now Nkechi Amare Diallo, gawked at in public, and the attention is certainly unfair to her children, who didn’t court any publicity. To the extent that the film has a perspective, it’s summed up by one of her sons: All she did was say that she was black, and the world lost its mind.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 19, 2018But basic sympathy is where the usefulness of “The Rachel Divide” ends. Ms. Brownson hasn’t figured out how to construct a movie around a figure who essentially owes her fame to the obfuscation of her past. Anything Ms. Dolezal says has to be taken with such a large grain of salt that it’s not clear why it’s worth listening.To be fair, Ms. Dolezal comes across as sincere, and the film devotes ample time to the criticisms directed at her. It’s hard not to gawk when she ponders what to check in the “race” box on a form after the birth of her latest son, Langston Attickus Dolezal, or visits the D.M.V. as part of the name change. But such forehead-slapping moments go no more than skin-deep."

Relegated to sparsely attended panels for 1980s television, Keith drinks and bellyaches with fellow festival D-listers, Matt (Ryan Kwanten), Brock (Brooks Braselman) and Allison (Maggie Grace). The star of the Supercon convention is Adam King (Clancy Brown), a veteran of a science fiction show akin to “Star Trek” whose ego threatens to overshadow his gigantic Supercon autograph fees. After a confrontation between Keith and King leads the convention’s manager, Gil (Mike Epps, a standout), to remove Keith and his friends from the convention lineup, the group of festival outcasts conspire to rob Supercon.“Supercon” offers lip service to fan culture, yet it is difficult to imagine who would enjoy watching this ill-conceived satire. Directed by Zak Knutson, who also contributed to the screenplay, the movie is careless with its setting, callous toward its characters and crass about its audience. Characters are frequently introduced with a barrage of racist, sexist or homophobic slurs, which offend even as they take up time that might have been spent telling a real joke. Neither heroes nor villains are exempt from the film’s brand of boorish nincompoopery, nor do the characters develop beyond their vulgar first impressions.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018Unpalatable characterization can sometimes be masked by good taste in cinematic style, but the only compensation offered by Mr. Knutson for the flimsiness of his script is an excess of bathroom humor. Most debilitating from a stylistic viewpoint, the geography of the Supercon festival is never clearly established, making the mechanics of Keith’s heist feel weightless, even obligatory. This con has no surprises, only detours, and the result is that despite its slim running time, “Supercon” is a drag."

Buckminster Fuller.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018The two live in “The House of Tomorrow,” a geodesic dome in Minnesota that serves as both tourist attraction and opportunity for Josephine to educate the masses on her beloved Bucky’s futuristic philosophies. This bubble-wrapped existence is punctured when Josephine conveniently has a stroke, sidelining her just long enough for Sebastian to meet and bond with Jared (Alex Wolff), a glamorously rebellious, aspiring punk rocker. Maybe they could start a band!Working from Peter Bognanni’s 2010 novel, the writer and director, Peter Livolsi, has created a painfully quirky tale that’s so contrived you can almost hear the gears of the plot grinding. Both young men are damaged (Jared has a heart problem), and neither has friends; both are cared for by a single, doting relative. But while Jared’s father (Nick Offerman) displays understandable concern, Sebastian’s grandmother behaves so oddly that she’s more like a jailer. (“You drank soda!” she gasps, almost succumbing to another medical event.)Buoyed by a bona fide punk-rock soundtrack — the less said about our heroes’ screaming and thrashing, the better — “The House of Tomorrow” is bland and manufactured. Mr. Butterfield’s deer-in-the-headlights naïveté plays well against Mr. Wolff’s charismatic angst; yet less time with either and more with Maude Apatow, as Jared’s smart sister, and Michaela Watkins as his troubled mother, would have made for a much more satisfying movie."

Dressed in too-long skirts and too-small sweaters, her skin preternaturally translucent and her collarbone a knife edge, she stands, frozen, in front of a classroom erupting with rowdy students. They can see her vulnerability and scent her ineptitude, and they are contemptuous.Her real name is Madame Géquil, and she teaches physics, or tries to, at a technical school in an unnamed Parisian suburb. Even beyond her mostly nonwhite classroom, disdain for her flourishes among her fellow teachers and their pompous principal (Romain Duris), who hints darkly of termination. Things are scarcely better at home, where her cheery househusband (José Garcia) greets her with elaborately prepared meals and insultingly sexist advice. Perhaps, he suggests, she should tame her charges with her beauty?Before she can give that a try, a storm sends a bolt of lightning into the laboratory where she’s conducting an experiment. Like Drew Barrymore’s character in “Firestarter” (1984), she can now incinerate at will. (She’s also so glowy a meddling neighbor suspects she’s having an affair.) More important, her transformation comes with teaching skills that stun her students, especially Malik (Adda Senani), a disabled Arab whose rudeness and ingratitude fail to deter her from adopting him as her protégé.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018“Mrs. Hyde” might draw inspiration from Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” but its true horror lies less in a rampaging alter ego than its depiction of a culture that scorns serious thought. That notion, though — like almost every other thematic strand — is simply dangled without apparent purpose or resolution as Géquil drifts through the movie, randomly melting ice and cremating animals.In one of several strange scenes, she follows Malik into the housing projects at night, seeming oddly fixated on the young man as he stands apart, watching fellow students enjoy a communal rap session. He’s as much of an outcast as she is; yet whenever the movie tries to say something insightful about racial integration — or education, or any number of issues — it backs off or bogs down. It’s so tonally and ideologically unfocused that its ideas just slip away.The actors navigate this muddle as best they can. Barely emoting, Ms. Huppert displays neither personality nor agency; she’s simply a tool, first as a symbol of our contempt for learning, and later as an avenger on its behalf. Similarly, her students, are merely a collection of insubordinate behaviors, untethered to any context beyond that of the familiar classroom story whose wildlings are transformed by inspirational pedagogy.Alone among the cast, resplendent in coordinating pastels and preening self-regard, the marvelous Mr. Duris embraces the movie’s weirdness. His director should have done the same, by retooling the original Hyde’s depravities for a woman and ejecting the script’s more ponderous moralizing. Instead, he has created a good-looking, sporadically entertaining farce whose soft, vibrant tones conceal a disappointingly empty vessel. I’m sure Mr. Bozon (who taught for three years in a suburban high school) has something useful to say about the French school system, but he doesn’t say it here."

Or even a consistent setting, really. Although the film takes place in upstate New York in a vaguely 1960s period, the accents sound like the work of actors playing lawman dress-up after too many viewings of “Bonnie and Clyde.”The movie centers on two deputies, Thurman (Jake McDorman) and Jim (Martin Starr), in a jurisdiction that barely sees any crime. But their lack of convictions doesn’t sit well with the crusty old sheriff (Ron Perlman). No sooner has he fired them than a warden phones with news of an escaped prisoner nearby.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018The pair decide that a bit of vigilante sleuthing might earn them their jobs back (well, right after they use all their ammunition firing at — and failing to hit — a can of cola). Eventually, they do catch up with the prisoner (George Sample III). But he may be innocent, a victim of race-based injustice, which complicates the ex-officers’ plans.Zach Golden, a writer and director making his first feature, clearly has ambitions that exceed his modest budget.

It’s possible to admire his gumption, as Mr. Perlman’s character might put it, but “The Escape of Prisoner 614” doesn’t set steady terms for itself, let alone convince on them."

Together, those interviewed make a strong case against the exam and its administrator, the College Board. Yet even though they agree on the inadequacy, and even the harmfulness, of the test, few can avoid being involved with it.Colleges, too, are shown to be stuck in a quandary: to rely less on the SAT could mean that the average score of admitted students falls. That would cause a college’s rankings to slip, which would hurt its ability to recruit students and raise money. More worrisome is evidence that high schools are caught in a cycle of their own, in which they gear curriculums toward test preparation rather than academics.Frustrating yet fascinating, “The Test” leaves quite a bit unaddressed: the effects of gender, race and parental income on performance deserve more attention than they receive here. Still, it’s a film that doggedly questions an exam that affects the futures of millions and feeds the fortunes of several big industries. Someone else — the schools — needs to supply some good answers."

Overlooking Tahrir Square, visiting filmmaker friends of Khalid’s make a pact to send him footage from Beirut, Baghdad and Berlin.Earlier, the Lebanese colleague, Bassem (Bassem Fayad), complains that a panel discussion of cinema is too focused on politics. It’s tempting to take that as Mr. El Said’s mission statement, but despite his poetic, decontextualized imagery, politics and volatility are always present, in the streets or overheard in broadcasts. (At one point, Khalid films an assault outside his window, watching without intervening.)Whether “In the Last Days of the City” ultimately comes together as a feature is open to debate, but this is a film of beauty and skill."

As Natalie packs up to leave her longtime boyfriend, Liam (Josh Whitehouse), the CDs she boxes bring back memories — like one of their first meeting, during which Liam avidly mansplained Blur and she cutely one-upped him.Much of the movie, which shows Natalie landing a corporate job while musician Liam doggedly pursues the rock ‘n’ roll dream, is an advertisement for male emotional immaturity. Liam just has oodles of integrity. When Natalie suggests he acquire an iPhone, he brays, “I refuse to join the ranks of the Sudoku-playing, latte-sipping, iPhone-wearing clones who adorn this city oblivious to the fact that their individuality has been co-opted by a handful of global multinationals.” As Joan Didion once wrote in a not-entirely-different context, “Oh, wow.”As for poor Natalie (an engaging Freya Mavor in a thankless role), one wishes that a friend would gift her a copy of Julie Klausner’s book “I Don’t Care About Your Band.” Instead, Natalie has to settle for the hoariest convention in the cinematic Book of Love, the one in which the guy realizes what a fool he’s been and becomes a different person overnight."

But in tying its story to this particular moment in American history, the movie bites off more than it can coherently chew. “Kings” opens with a dramatic re-creation of the 1991 shooting of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins by a liquor store owner, an event that galvanized South Central before the King trial was finished. The trial itself is, in this movie, a constant presence on televisions in homes and businesses. While the subsequent unrest is sometimes credibly depicted in hellscape imagery, Ms. Ergüven deploys her absurdist sense of humor with bad judgment in the movie’s final third."

It’s a personal movie, beginning with her 2013 visit to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, at the invitation of a friend. Admitting that she, a longtime lover of elephants, was looking for “a happy ending story,” Ms. Bell was instead shocked as she flew over deforested areas where, she is told, poachers run rampant. The movie runs down some dispiriting statistics (there are less than 50,000 Asian elephants alive today), and is unsparing in showing the cruelty required to train an elephant to perform tricks and give rides to humans.Ms. Bell embarks on an elephant rescue with Sangdeaun Lek Chailert, the brave Thai conservationist. Adopting a nearly blind 70-year-old elephant from a rueful “elephant-trek” proprietor, they drive 500 miles to the sanctuary, where a new life is in store for the animal. It’s a hard journey. The transformation of the elephant once it is at the sanctuary is remarkable.

It’s almost a surprise that Ronit (Rachel Weisz), a successful art photographer living in New York, can breathe, given how drained of oxygen this frustrating movie is. It doesn’t seem especially airless at first, when Ronit is seen taking a portrait of a tattooed, bare-chested, much-older gent. They’re in a nice, roomy studio, and as he poses, she teasingly speaks to him about smiling, a nonchalant exchange that telegraphs some of this story’s larger concerns.Ronit lives in the modern age, in the here and now of groovy tattooed seniors, art photography and liberated women, but “Disobedience” tracks her when she steps back in time after the death of her rabbi father (Anton Lesser), a revered religious figure in north London. Like Ronit’s portrait subject, the rabbi — seen early on delivering a sermon — is prodigiously bearded, though the other man’s body art underscores the divide separating these men and their realities. This in-between space is where Ronit now uneasily lives. She doesn’t cover her head and freely smokes, yet she also rends her clothes in mourning, ripping material with her teeth as the tears fall.VideoSebastián Lelio narrates a sequence from his film, starring Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz.Published OnApril 26, 2018CreditCreditBleecker StreetBased on the novel of the same title by Naomi Alderman, “Disobedience” delicately and far too bloodlessly charts the intricacies of Ronit’s return to a tight religious community that no longer wholly welcomes her. One who does, though hesitantly, is Dovid (a very good Alessandro Nivola), a once-close comrade who is her father’s probable successor. Ronit also resumes her relationship with a former lover, Esti (Rachel McAdams), Dovid’s wife. The women’s reunion rapidly rekindles a passion that — with stolen kisses and progressively steamier intimacy — disturbs this world’s scrupulous order, a disruption that is more about hidebound tradition than about religious belief.The director Sebastián Lelio should have been a good fit for this story if only because of the sensitivity he’s brought to female-driven movies like “Gloria.” Although “Disobedience” seems to offer him similar material — female desire up against the patriarchy — it defeats him. He handles the story’s cloistered confines with visual intelligence, finding beauty in austerity though to an aestheticizing fault, as when Ronit walks amid a procession of mourners in which everyone seems arranged by height. The problem isn’t the scene, which is gracefully shot and staged. It’s that you notice the visual design but have no sense of — or feeling for — the faith binding these mourners.That puts a heavy burden on Ms. McAdams, who with some cursory lines of dialogue, a lot of brooding dark looks and some behind-doors weeping needs to make a persuasive case for why Esti stayed in this world and with her husband. Ms. McAdams, who lets you see the eddies of emotion rippling over Esti’s face as she pulls off her wig, does some lovely work here to convey a woman agonizing over her existential situation. Yet even as she and the filmmakers — Mr. Lelio shares script credit with Rebecca Lenkiewicz — thicken the texture, adding realistic details that should energize the scenes, the movie insistently puts a secular frame around its story, leaving little room for the metaphysical.Part of what makes Ms. McAdams and Ms. Weisz such appealing performers is how persuasively they convey the inner lives of the characters they play, which makes it easy to put yourself on their side. Yet “Disobedience” is so emphatically on Ronit’s side from the get go that the character has no mystery, which in turn robs the audience of the very possibility of discovery or surprise. Ronit is an uncomplicated exile from patriarchy, and demonstrably ill at ease among the Orthodox. In this, she clearly serves as a proxy for the secular viewer, who in “Disobedience” is invited to intimately witness the agony of faith but not its potentially more unfamiliar, more discomfiting ecstasy."

He is quite impressed with his amatory skills, which makes one of them. The scene — tender, awkward, comical — is candid but not graphic, the vibe less voyeuristic than analytical. What people say and do while they’re having sex is revealing, not only of their bodies but also of their feelings, egos and motivations. So if we want to know who Isabelle is and what she’s like — the principal concern of Claire Denis’s shrewd and uncompromising new film — then the bedroom might be as good a place as any to start.Ms. Denis, consistently the most interesting French filmmaker of the 21st century (see “Beau Travail,” “White Material” and “35 Shots of Rum,” among others), focuses her attention on a subject that could easily have been rendered sad, sensational or sentimental. The sexuality of middle-aged women, when it comes up at all in Hollywood, tends to be treated with either pity or condescending encouragement.As played by Juliette Binoche, Isabelle is defiantly immune to both of those, and even, at times, to the audience’s sympathy. Ms. Binoche, effortlessly charismatic and ruthlessly unvain, has no investment in the character’s likability. She and Ms. Denis could not care less what you think of her. “Let the Sunshine In” commits itself to taking Isabelle on her own terms. The challenge, for her and for the audience, is to figure out what those terms are.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 17, 2018This has a lot to do with her relations with men, sexual and otherwise. The film is partly an impressionistic chronicle, by turns comical and melodramatic, of her affairs — the French word is histoires — with various unsatisfactory men. In addition to Vincent (Xavier Beauvois), who is married and intends to stay that way, there is a moody unnamed actor (Nicolas Duvauchelle) who uses ambivalence as a kind of foreplay, and François (Laurent Grévill), Isabelle’s ex-husband and the father of her briefly glimpsed 10-year-old daughter. Later, on a trip to a provincial art festival, Isabelle meets Sylvain (Paul Blain), whose working-class background dismays one of her snooty art-world guy friends, who no doubt thinks Isabelle would be happier with him. But Isabelle suspects she might be happiest with Marc (Alex Descas), who gently defers (but doesn’t entirely decline) her advances.Happiness is elusive, and to some degree irrelevant. Isabelle is fascinating — puzzling, charming, irritating, worth caring about — because she’s intelligent and free. The shape of the film, which ambles through her days and nights in a way that feels more causal than it is, reflects the elusive pattern of her experience. She is impulsive rather than systematic, but nonetheless serious in her desire to figure out what she wants.Toward the end, she turns for help to a spiritualist of some kind, a healer whose arrival is a dazzling and confounding surprise. I don’t really believe in spoilers, but to name the actor who plays this man would be a betrayal of France, cinema and everything else I hold dear. (Resist the urge to Google.) He counsels Isabelle to develop an “interior sun,” a phrase that supplies the film’s French title and that is bizarrely reversed by the English translation, which irrelevantly evokes “Hair.” (“I would never have chosen that title,” Ms. Denis said in a recent interview in The Guardian.)Even though Isabelle is counseled to remain “open” (her adviser uses the English word), Ms. Denis makes it clear that external sources of illumination are as untrustworthy as men. Ms. Binoche is the film’s primary and sufficient source of light. The radiance is all hers. The clouds, too."

Early on, someone menacingly (and presciently) says, “You may think this is suffering. No: It’s salvation.” That’s a bit overstated either way. It’s puzzlement and irritation and also, yes, delight. But of course this film, the 19th installment in a series, was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation. In that respect it shouldn’t really be thought of as a movie at all, at least in the ways people with jobs like mine are accustomed to using the word. Which poses a few difficulties, for me and also, I would argue, for you.Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, scrappy fraternal climbers up the 21st-century Hollywood ladder, “Infinity War” is a chunk of matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a vast entity that long ago expanded beyond the usual boundaries of sequelization and brand extension. This synergistic expression of the corporate interests of Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company — which now include 19 feature films and much else besides — has come to be less a creative or commercial undertaking than an immutable fact of life, like sex or the weather or capitalism itself.VideoThe directors Anthony and Joe Russo narrate a scene featuring Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Benedict Wong and Tom Holland.Published OnMay 7, 2018CreditCreditChuck Zlotnick/Disney-MarvelThat makes the franchise hard to criticize. You can’t really be for or against Marvel (in spite of the conspiracy theories of some DC fans), and you can’t quite opt out of it either. They don’t call it a universe for nothing: Where else are we going to go? So we make our zigzagging ways, picking out our favorite planets and solar systems, accepting a baseline of tedious, standardized dead space that makes the brighter constellations seem disproportionately fresh and surprising. “Guardians of the Galaxy” was so funny and weird. Not like a superhero movie at all. Same with “Thor: Ragnarok.” Captain America is such a complicated guy. “Black Panther” gave audiences so much to root for and talk about.[ Read A.O. Scott’s spoiler-filled article about the ending of “Avengers: Infinity War.” ]Those interesting, unusual specimens — what we used to think of, in simpler times, as “good movies” — aren’t exactly accidents. They are carefully planned exceptions that uphold a rule (meaning a regime as well as a norm) of passive acceptance disguised as enthusiasm. This universe is engineered for variety and inclusiveness, within certain strict parameters. Above all, the Disney-Marvel combination is a giant machine that manufactures maximum consent. The cosmos is theirs. The rest of us just live in it.I’m not complaining, but rather pointing out how pointless, how silly it sounds when anyone bothers to venture a complaint. Who wants to be a hater? Still, it’s worth noting that the ascendance of Marvel (and of other, not quite as universal entities like it) has narrowed the parameters of criticism. I’m supposed to tell you, in this review, how much fun you’ll have at “Infinity War.” (Yes, you will have some. Will you have enough? Almost.) But I’ve probably already gone too far in trying to think about what it means. The Marvel movies and others of their kind often produce an illusion of profundity, a slick, murky overlay of allegorical suggestiveness. This provides grist for the kind of think pieces that spar with one another — “Infinity War” is liberal; no, it’s conservative; but don’t you see that it’s a protest against Trump; actually, it’s an attack on the tyranny of political correctness — until they catalyze the inevitable anti-intellectual backlash. It’s just a movie! Don’t spoil the fun!And of course it is with respect to “spoilers” that the policing of discourse is most ruthlessly and effectively practiced. Reviewers who attend advance screenings take a vow of silence about plot details that will be widely known within a week and all but forgotten a week after that. Government secrets are guarded with less care, and requests from public officials to go off the record are addressed with more skepticism. But if I mention which superhero dies, or which one has an unexpected relationship with someone else — well, I wouldn’t dream of it. Not because I’m afraid of Disney executives. It’s the wrath of their obedient, weaponized minions I fear. In other words: you.This is not a healthy situation. The reasonable concern that major plot elements not be divulged has spawned a phobic, hypersensitive taboo against public discussion of anything that happens onscreen. If, for example, I were to share that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) mistakes Rocket (Bradley Cooper), who is a raccoon, for a rabbit — whoops, you already hit “send,” didn’t you? The joke is repeated a half-dozen times, so it kind of ruins itself. And until the end, the whole thing is weirdly free of any but the most superficial, mechanical surprises.The action is especially tedious and predictable. I mean both the scenes of fighting and flying and the overall rhythm of the first two hours or so. People talk for a while, sprinkling jokes and morsels of personality into the heavy dough of exposition. Then they fight in the usual way, by throwing giant objects (and one another) and shooting waves of color from their hands. The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination.ImageJosh Brolin as the genocidal Thanos in “Avengers: Infinity War.”CreditMarvel/DisneyThere is so much to explain, but basically a large purple fellow named Thanos (Josh Brolin) wants, on vague Malthusian principles, to wipe out half the life in the universe. As you try to keep track of all the good guys massed against him, you may decide he has a point. But he’s not a bad villain. I mean, he’s very bad, but his malevolence is laced with melancholy, and there is a ghastly grandeur to his ambition.To fulfill his evil plans, Thanos needs to collect six “infinity stones,” which in spite of their awesome power look a lot like what you would find in the craft kit you have been meaning to regift since your kid’s seventh birthday. Also, come on: Another quest for magic gewgaws? This one lumbers from Vormir to Knowhere to Titan, with terrestrial stops in New York, Scotland and Wakanda. Along the way, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) stage a Sherlock Holmes meta-duel and compare goatees. The hunky-Chris showdown — Hemsworth vs. Pratt (Peter Quill) vs. Evans (Captain America) — ends in a three-way tie. Zoe Saldana is heartbreaking as Gamora. If you end up wanting more Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) or War Machine (Don Cheadle), or whoever your favorite happens to be — well, that’s kind of the idea, isn’t it?But where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. “Infinity War” is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world. But those emotions can also be folded back into the movies themselves. This universe is coming to an end. And then where will we be?"

I’d be lying if I said their maleness didn’t show. Their humor gets its slapstick from the Three Stooges, its non sequitur verbal mojo from the less-cerebral routines of the Firesign Theater, with a dash of Monty Python tossed in. The troupe’s bro rambunctiousness stems from “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” but the crude sexual humor, thankfully I’d have to say, mostly sticks to the mocking of male genitalia.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018In this movie’s largely unimportant plot, the eternal adolescents reprise their 2002 roles as ineffectual Vermont state troopers, looking for a shot at redemption by overseeing an adjustment of United States borders into parts that had heretofore been Canadian.When the guys aren’t razzing each other — a typical exchange goes, “Are you serious?” “Serious as a heart attack — and I should know, I’ve had two!” — they are mixing it up with the Mounted Police they’ll soon be supplanting.

The movie is seriously suboptimal, but she is such a force for good — for comedy, for women — and the laughs land often enough that you can go, if somewhat begrudgingly, with the messy flow. But dear lord she needs to work with better material, with funnier, sharper, far smarter scripts and with directors who can do something, anything, with the camera. There’s more cinematic intelligence in the best bits on her Comedy Central show “Inside Amy Schumer” than in her three starring vehicles.In her last one, “Snatched,” Ms. Schumer played the clueless, often beleaguered yet fundamentally decent and finally (of course) triumphant character that is a familiar comedic type. The character was a kind of holy fool, a very weak variation on the title disaster that she played in “Trainwreck,” her breakout, a movie — notably — she also wrote. The big idea in “Snatched” is the constancy of mother love (Goldie Hawn played Mom), which is tethered to a wincing story that trades on the clichés about dangerous foreigners. It’s a clunker not least because its you-go-girl ethos is delivered through the spectacle of white women imperiled by villains with (other) accents and darker skin.In “I Feel Pretty,” Ms. Schumer again embraces the part of the lovable not-quite-losers, women who are always trying hard to fit in but who invariably stand out because they’re sometimes falling splat on their faces. Her Renee Bennett works for Lily LeClair, a big beauty company with fancy Fifth Avenue digs. For some reason, she toils in a decrepit basement office in Chinatown with one taciturn co-worker (Adrian Martinez). Renee is an exile at work (an existential situation that worked better in Mike Judge’s movie “Office Space”), but when she is summoned to LeClair headquarters she glimpses another world.It’s heaven on earth, or so she believes, an exotic realm filled with long-legged stunners who look like they’re cat-walking on a Paris runway even when strolling down an office hall. They leave Renee agog, none more so than the boss, Avery LeClair, played by Michelle Williams with a thick schmear of makeup and the stunned look of a recent accident victim. Working a delectably funny, unsexy squeak — a somewhat adenoidal version of Marilyn Monroe baby-breathiness — Ms. Williams slips off with the movie whenever she totters onscreen. Avery is a cartoon of conventional feminine beauty; Ms. Williams’s performance also suggests that she’s a casualty of that same convention.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018There’s a kernel of a bright idea in that paradox, but, alas, the movie isn’t about Avery, or especially bright. It’s about Renee, who’s appealing partly because Ms. Schumer is and because the character has been calculated to trigger anyone who’s ever felt like one of life’s losers. That doubtless means most of Earth’s population, even if Renee’s feelings of inadequacies specifically involve how she looks, which the story largely frames as a problem of self-confidence. When you meet Renee, she is going to a class at SoulCycle — one of a number of egregious product placements — an otherwise everyday activity that she approaches with jitters and darting, I’m-so-unworthy looks at other, thinner women.“I Feel Pretty” cannily never says that thinner is better; it’s too smart to go there. And it doesn’t have to because Renee expresses that each time she gazes — eyes shining and widening — at another woman who looks a few dress sizes smaller than she is. (She doesn’t bestow such gaga looks on her friends, played by the appealing duo of Busy Philipps and Aidy Bryant.) The story kicks in when Renee suffers a knockout blow and wakes up believing she is a knockout. The movie’s one, endlessly repeated joke is that the only thing that’s changed is how this fit, attractive woman sees herself. And because Renee now believes she’s beautiful, she easily snags a dream job and boyfriend (Rory Scovel).Renee’s new attitude begets silliness and slapstick, and it also brings her woe as her confidence sours into imperiousness and worse. This temperament change doesn’t stick narratively; mostly, it gives Renee stuff to do and say. It also undermines the character, suggesting that she never was the inherently decent person she seemed to be. That decency is presumably why Renee has adoring, supportive friends, and it also helps temper her comic bumbling and foolishness, humanizing her frailties while pulling you to her emotionally. It’s why you’re on her side when she falls off an exercise bike or splits her pants or is effectively banished from a clothing store by a haughty sales clerk.I’ve been there, and it’s a good guess you have, too. The idea that a lack of self-confidence can be essentially bootstrapped away — that all we need to combat oppressive forces is the power of positive thinking and a flattering lipstick — is an exhausted, false fairy tale, one peddled by (among others!) self-help books, beauty companies and, disappointingly, movies like this one.Another filmmaker might have comically eviscerated that lie, or at least smacked it around. (The writers-directors here are Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein.) It’s clear that Ms. Schumer knows a thing or two about sexist ideologies, real power struggles and all the deeply unfunny, unpretty rest. She can go more than skin deep."

Beginning with Andreas-Salomé’s youthful renunciation of eroticism and following her through the affairs that would change her mind and make her famous, the movie fights to establish this controversial figure as an integral part of intellectual life in her time.As Andreas-Salomé grows from a youthful iconoclast to become the first female psychoanalyst in Europe, she is played by four actresses, each portraying her at a different age. Following her retirement, Andreas-Salomé (Nicole Heesters) dictates the trials of her youth to Ernst Pfeiffer (Matthias Lier), the executor of her will and protector of her legacy.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018As a child (Helena Pieske), she is pampered by her elderly father; as a teenager (Liv Lisa Fries), she is betrayed by her intellectual mentor. And as a woman (Katharina Lorenz), she is relentlessly pursued by admirers who are among the greatest thinkers of the 19th century, including the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Rée and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke.Throughout, the writer and director Cordula Kablitz-Post asserts Andreas-Salomé’s commitment to her own independence. But Ms. Kablitz-Post’s focus on Andreas-Salomé’s suitors has the effect of chaining the early feminist’s legacy to exactly the patriarchal conventions she claims to reject.Though the dialogue quotes Andreas-Salomé on individualistic topics such as fantasy or narcissism, the film’s style remains tethered to trifling teatimes and the quarrels between those who are not yet lovers. The result is a movie that handsomely depicts a great woman’s circumstances, while leaving her most liberated ideas obscure."

Managing to feel at once painfully slow and bafflingly truncated, this creaky triptych of not-so-scary tales is a tame curiosity of movie nostalgia.Written and directed by Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman, and based on their 2010 stage play, the movie slinks after Professor Goodman (Mr. Nyman), debunker of paranormal claims and scourge of charlatans. A mysterious tape directs him to investigate three victims of supposedly supernatural visitations: A night watchman at an abandoned former asylum (Paul Whitehouse); a twitchy young man (Alex Lawther) who believes he saw a demon; and a wealthy widower (Martin Freeman) troubled by a poltergeist.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018Each tale, though, is merely a series of enigmatic brush strokes, narrative outlines bristling with loose ends. The widower feeds what appears to be dog food to his possibly monstrous baby, but we never see its face. The unplumbed dynamic between the young man and his peculiarly angry parents is much more unsettling than the horned entity that provokes his crisis. And Goodman’s recurring visions of anti-Semitism tease without clarity or payoff.Shot on location in Yorkshire, England, “Ghost Stories” feels cramped and claustrophobic, its oppressively dark locations — a weeping tunnel, a dank cellar, a grimly decorated trailer — straining our eyes and our patience. There is, however, some humor among the bygone boos, including the fact that more than one specter wants to stick its fingers in Goodman’s mouth.

Yet hope still flickers throughout this documentary, which tells the stories of six Jewish women who survived the Nazi death machine and went on to rebuild their lives in the United States.Starting with the Allied liberation of the concentration camps, the film traces the women’s experiences using interviews and news footage, some of it horribly brutal. Life was treacherous for Jews in Europe even after the war. Anti-Semitism remained virulent, and survivors journeyed long distances home only to find their possessions stolen. One woman recalls coming back and being threatened by strangers who had moved into her house and were wearing her clothes.All six eventually relocated to America, where they were bewildered by friends and relatives, who were loath to mention the camps. We hear how these women struggled with questions of whether to have children, who to trust and how to live with recurring nightmares. Most have since found a measure of peace; several continue to speak publicly about their experiences.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018Jon Kean, the director, chose the material wisely and doesn’t shy from severe images. He and his team also have good ears for anecdotes. One woman remembers making clothes from old parachutes.

After learning of recent atrocities in other countries, a few lament our still-violent world. “Didn’t people learn anything from World War II, and from the Holocaust?” one asks.

His story instincts, however, are more run of the mill. “Beyond the Clouds,” which he wrote with Mehran Kashani, is a tale of a bad kid who rediscovers his good side, and it relies on dynamics that are commonplace if not outright clichéd.Set and shot in Mumbai, the movie follows Amir, who is a drug runner. He and his friend are burned by bosses who think Amir (Ishaan Khattar) has gotten too bigheaded. (His offense: asking to be paid.) Running from cops, he finds his sister Tara (Malavika Mohanan) at a bazaar. Although they’re estranged, she takes him in, and her boss, Akshi (Goutam Ghose), hides the drugs Amir was carrying.Akshi tells Tara he’ll return the goods for a price — at which point he tries to rape her. Hitting him with a brick to defend herself, Tara winds up in prison, where she, like all criminal suspects in this system, can be held without bail until a trial. While trying to exonerate his sister, Amir somewhat inadvertently winds up forming a bond with Akshi’s mother and daughters.The movie’s depictions of poverty and social injustice have the potential to be wrenching, in the tradition of neorealist Italian pictures of the 1950s or, more pertinently, the early work of Satyajit Ray.

And not because the setup lacks drama: The true story of Susette Kelo’s yearslong battle to save her waterfront home in a declining Connecticut town would conclude in the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s simply that the writer and director, Courtney Moorehead Balaker, fails to translate that drama into the language of movies.Instead, she turns it into advocacy as Kelo (Catherine Keener), a soft-spoken paramedic, and her blue-collar neighbors face off against the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. In a bid to rejuvenate the town’s economy, the state’s politically ambitious governor (Aaron Douglas) and his smooth-talking sidekick (Jeanne Tripplehorn) have persuaded Pfizer to plan a luxury redevelopment. Invoking his right to eminent domain, the governor begins a sustained campaign to acquire the homes.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018CreditCreditRicardo Hubbs/Korchula Productions and Brightlight PicturesPalely photographed and anchored by a quiet, rather weary performance from Ms. Keener, “Little Pink House” is a peculiarly enervated affair. The structure is choppy, and there are odd moments of tonal dissonance. (In one of these, Kelo’s lawyer is so eager to coax his self-effacing client in front of television cameras that he pronounces her “smokin’ hot.”) While the script yanks our emotions, crucial legal decisions are sidelined or relegated to a vague coda when audiences are likely to be shuffling to the exits.Seemingly more focused on its cause than on fleshing out its characters (they’re either hiss- or hurrah-worthy), “Little Pink House” reveals almost nothing about Kelo, her past or her new partner (the likable Callum Keith Rennie). Refusing to entertain even the possibility that eminent domain might be defensible, the movie desires no discussion. All it wants is our sympathy."

The period covered by the film includes the 37-year-old Godard’s marriage to the 19-year-old actress Anne Wiazemsky (on whose memoir it’s based) and the uprising of French students and workers in May 1968, a revolt that, among other things, shut down that year’s Cannes Film Festival. On being informed of the existence of Mr. Hazanavicius’s project, Mr. Godard — who is now 87 and whose latest film, “Le Livre d’Image,” will be in Cannes next month — is reported to have called it a “stupid, stupid idea.” Au contraire! (All due respect.) It’s a brilliant idea. It just happens to be a terrible movie.But not without a certain morbid fascination. For hard-core Godardians, “Godard Mon Amour” will be an indispensable hate-watch. For the Godard-ambivalent, the critical outrage of the partisans will provide its own kind of amusement. But you don’t need to have strong feelings about Godard to notice the off flavors in this airy, brightly colored macaron. You may know two or three things about him when the movie starts — or about France, politics, sex and cinema — but rest assured that by the time it’s over, you will know less.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018Godard, for better and for worse, is a cinematic thinker, someone who has tried, over the course of a prolific and contentious career, to locate the philosophical potential and the intellectual essence of the medium, to make it a vessel for ideas and arguments as well as for stories, pictures and emotions. Mr. Hazanavicius is the opposite: an unmistakably skilled maker and manipulator of images and styles with nothing much to say and no conviction that anything needs to be said at all. His appropriation of Mr. Godard’s most imitable signatures — counterpointed voice-overs, chapter titles that pop onto the screen, jaunty editing, naked women speaking in riddles — amounts less to homage than to revenge. “Godard Mon Amour” works tirelessly to implicate its subject in its own shallowness.Godard in 1967 and 1968 is a famous and controversial director, a culture hero of the times chafing against his fame and trying to adapt his art to the volatile political climate. Wiazemsky (played by Stacy Martin), granddaughter of the conservative writer François Mauriac, has recently starred in “La Chinoise,” Godard’s contribution to (and satire of) the Maoist turn in left-wing French youth culture. She marries him and gladly takes on the role of muse and erotic ideal, finding his grumpiness charming and his intelligence very sexy.Godard’s charisma is made plausible partly by the fact that he is played by Louis Garrel, whose casting is a bit of a French film in-joke. (Mr. Garrel’s father, Philippe, is a director who has been called “the child of Cocteau and Godard.”) Mr. Garrel is a formidable actor, and also, it turns out, a clever celebrity impersonator. In a different pop-culture universe, his Godard, with a voice like a sibilant bullfrog and a permanent air of mild indigestion, might be a fixture of “Saturday Night Live,” showing up as an occasional commentator on “Weekend Update” or a contestant on “Black Jeopardy.”ImageStacy Martin in “Godard Mon Amour,” which is based on the memoir of the actress Anne Wiazemsky.CreditCohen Media GroupHere, the running joke is that he keeps breaking his glasses, sometimes at the demonstrations that provide Mr. Hazanavicius with opportunities for walking-and-talking exposition and cast-of-dozens action sequences. Occasionally, amid the chanting and banner waving, a fan will approach to praise Godard’s early-60s movies like “Breathless” and “Contempt.” The devolution of the director’s response from awkward politeness to outright nastiness is a sign of his creative, ideological and emotional crisis.Godard wants to find an approach to filmmaking that will answer to his sense of political urgency, an insurgent cinema that will be adamantly critical of everything conventional and bourgeois. Nothing is easier, at present, than to mock this ambition, and much of the politicized art of the late ’60s must have seemed naïve, pretentious or overstated even at the time. But the notion that film might offer more than capitalist entertainment and reflect impulses beyond individual self-expression — that it might provide a weapon against oppression or a route to collective imagination — shouldn’t be dismissed. Godard’s post-68 experiments, lazily evoked here as a dead end, could more productively be seen as a road not taken.This version of Godard must choose between cinema and politics, a predicament that would be more credible if Mr. Hazanavicius had a credible conception of either term. As for love, the ostensible focus of the movie, it represents another squandered opportunity. No one would argue that Mr. Godard is a nice guy. Misanthropy has been part of his persona since his days as a film critic, and his biography is littered with broken friendships and burned bridges. But in spite of Mr. Garrel’s mischief, this movie doesn’t even make him an interesting creep.Ms. Martin is a charming and dedicated performer, but the film is no better than Godard himself at appreciating Wiazemsky as a fully dimensional person. She loves her husband until he makes it impossible. He is narcissistic, professionally jealous and sexually possessive, freaking out when his wife is cast in an Italian movie that requires her to appear naked. His reaction leads to a scene in which Mr. Garrel and Ms. Martin, in their birthday suits, debate the ethics and aesthetics of on-camera nudity. This is the kind of self-referentiality that might be labeled “Godardian” by students in an introductory film class trying to bluff their way to a C. Which describes Mr. Hazanavicius pretty well."

So busy, in fact, that when her friend Philippe Berthier (André Dussollier), a much older doctor with whom she frequently works, proposes that she run for mayor, viewers may be even more inclined than the character to think the idea a little ridiculous: Where will she find the time?But Berthier has it all worked out. He’s affiliated with a new political party, led by Agnés Dorgelle (Catherine Jacob), a fiery, charismatic politician who just happens to be the daughter of a notorious nationalist and racist leader. Their organization will smooth things out for Pauline, who has long considered herself apolitical but who also has a strong sense of attachment to what she sees as innately French about her hometown.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018The film is directed by Lucas Belvaux, who wrote the screenplay with the novelist Jérôme Leroy. It takes for its inspiration the real-life rise of Marine Le Pen, the daughter of the National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has found some political success in promoting an arguably milder iteration of her father’s views. Mr. Belvaux’s movie focuses less on its Le Pen stand-in than on the tendrils of her organization.Berthier, seemingly kind and wise, is in fact a steely ideologue who has found what he believes to be a perfect puppet in Pauline. Her candidacy alienates her from some friends and brings out the inchoate racism and nationalism of others. In the meantime, she gets romantically involved with her old high school sweetheart, Stéphane (Guillaume Gouix), now a local boys’ soccer coach. He seems sweet, as tough guys go, but in fact he has a secret life as a racist paramilitary thug and has ties to Berthier’s less respectable past, too.The story line serves to demonstrate how fascism finds an acceptable face. But making Pauline’s new boyfriend a stealth villain is a little too pat, even if it does provide the movie with a sharp sting for its final minutes.The drama is well-paced, and all of the actors are wonderful. Mr. Dussollier, a regular presence in the late works of Alain Resnais, is resourceful in communicating Berthier’s disturbing dual nature, and Ms. Dequenne remains appealing even when her character is making the most grievously ill-advised choices.“This Is Our Land” is scariest and most effective in its illumination of the appeal of today’s particular brand of French nationalism. In this respect, Ms. Jacob’s work as Agnés galvanizes. Her speech to a fervent group of supporters insists that a nameless “they” will “never turn France into a caliphate.” She whips up the crowd until it seems to spontaneously rise and sing a vehement rendition of “La Marseillaise,” with particular emphasis on the lines about spilling “impure blood” on the land. It’s enough to make any fan of “Casablanca” cry, but not in a good way."

He sees a group of naked women bathing and chattering. It is the late 18th century, and he also sees native people walking along the crystalline water and under the endless, sheltering sky. Mostly, Zama — an official of the Spanish empire born in the Americas yet proudly, insistently Spanish — sees himself, as if gazing into in an enormous mirror. He sees a noble husband, father, magistrate, would-be lover and defender of the crown. He sees a world that is being remade in his image, not grasping that his mirror is cracked.Lucrecia Martel’s cinematic marvel “Zama” tells the dreamlike story of Don Diego (a wonderful Daniel Giménez Cacho), a proud if beleaguered agent of Western colonialism. When you first meet him, Diego is waiting for a transfer from a desolate outpost. He has been waiting a long time. Over this pleasurably eccentric movie, Diego — with his noble head held high, his tragically ill-fitting wig and slow-growing despair — continues to wait, while simultaneously being assailed by slights, insults, rejections, humiliations, a comically inquisitive llama and catastrophic physical violence. Diego’s tribulations are almost worthy of a Christian martyr except that he is suffering for sins of his own making.ImageMr. Giménez Cacho with the absurdist llama.CreditStrand ReleasingIn “Zama,” colonialism shapes every scene, exchange and body; it is the air that people breathe. Soon after the movie opens, Diego oversees the interrogation of a bound, near-naked prisoner. The scene is brief, restrained; and its meaning — as is sometimes the case in this movie — seems oblique. The man’s crimes remain unstated, though you infer that his great offense may be his skin color. When he doesn’t confess, Diego decides to release the man, who runs right into a wall. He then haltingly speaks of a fish that swims to and fro, “fighting water that seeks to cast it upon dry land.” The water rejects it.The prisoner disappears, but his story’s allegorical power takes root. This elliptical approach is a familiar one for Ms. Martel, a well-regarded Argentine director (“La Ciénaga,” “The Headless Woman”) who conveys Diego’s story piecemeal. What joins the seemingly disconnected parts in “Zama” — what ties a sensual glance to a strange barking to a thief in the night to a desperate struggle — is Diego or rather his adamant, increasingly desperate request for a transfer. His desire to leave propels and all but defeats him. It also becomes the narrative through line, connecting Diego to everyone and everything, tethering him to the past and inexorably pulling him toward his fate.“Zama” is based on the brilliant 1956 novel by Antonio di Benedetto (1922-1986), only recently translated into English. (Suggestion: See the movie, read the book and then, for pleasure, see the movie again.) Ms. Martel’s “Zama,” for which she wrote the screenplay, departs in detail from the novel, though the two are more spiritually alike than not. What’s striking is how she conveys the novel’s singular first-person voice, one that is described in the introduction as “a certain abject nobility.” On the page, that voice is at once imperiously self-aggrandizing and unconsciously preposterous, with di Benedetto’s ironic detachment reverberating in each of Zama’s utterances.“My hand may strike a woman’s cheek,” Zama says in the novel at one point — casually, unknowingly and ridiculously expressing power’s terror — “but it is I who will endure the blow, for I shall have done violence to my own dignity.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 12, 2018CreditCreditStrand ReleasingMs. Martel retains patches of di Benedetto’s dialogue and the novel’s overall arc. For the most part, though, because she doesn’t use narration or scrolls of text, she expresses Diego’s story — its horrors, absurdity and her attitude toward each — through her limpid visual choices and the performances. Ms. Martel has a wonderful eye and can generate tension as much from the arrangement of bodies in a frame and scene as from any spoken line. In one scene, Diego courts Luciana (Lola Dueñas), a flirt in a preposterous wig worthy of Marie Antoinette. “Europe is best remembered by those who were never there,” Luciana says while fanned by a silent, attentive, presumably enslaved black man.These kinds of juxtapositions — the image of indolent whites served by enslaved blacks — function much like the doubled voice in the novel. Nothing if not dialectical, “Zama” is filled with such meaningful oppositions: freedom and captivity; open, bright skies and closed, gloomy homes. Ms. Martel’s cool approach fits di Benedetto’s story and can be just as devastating, especially when she abruptly flips drama into comedy. In one scene, as Diego receives humiliating news from a superior, his eyes and voice filling with emotion, she sets loose a llama that — after it slowly makes its way to the front of the shot to stand next to him — turns the moment absurd and Diego along with it.Mr. Giménez Cacho, who appears in nearly every scene, anchors “Zama” beautifully in an expressive yet reserved performance that pulls you in intellectually rather than emotionally. (Early on, when he stands in profile to the camera with his tricorn and aquiline nose, he suggests a misplaced George Washington.) This is crucial to how the movie works, particularly because it is told from the point of view of the colonizer, not the colonized. Ms. Martel is exploring the past, how we got here and why, but she is more interested in relations of power than in individual psychological portraits. The monstrous must be humanized to be understood, which doesn’t mean it deserves our tears.Europe has doomed the colonized, and it will doom the colonizers. With their stiff manners and unsuitable clothing, Diego and the rest of the colonialists seem perpetually ill at ease. At other times they seem deranged, delirious. In “Zama,” their wigs keep slipping; their humanity has already slid away. One man wants to enslave Indians to regain his status. Diego himself may be highly placed in the outpost, but his standing will always be suspect. As an Americano, he is caught — or perhaps lost — between the Old World and the New. He belongs to neither. And so Don Diego de Zama waits and he waits, marooned in a threatening, unwelcoming world that he himself helped create."

But this documentary restores her humanity.","2018-04-12","2018-04-13","2018-05-12 16:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/movies/-grace-jones-bloodlight-and-bami-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/13/arts/13gracejones/13gracejones-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Nudity has never seemed to bother Grace Jones. Her art has thrived, in part, on a physical candor that both shocked people and redrew the boundaries of taste, beauty and eroticism around her masculinity, ebony skin and unrelenting intensity. She’s an iconoclast, basically. And I imagine a downside of iconoclasm is that you never get to be a human being. This is someone whose long career as a model, actress and undervalued musician has veered, sometimes uncomfortably, into both the sub- and superhuman. So the relief of “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami” is that it seeks to square the person with the provocateuse.The documentary is a feat of portraiture and a restoration of humanity. It’s got the uncanny, the sublime, and, in many spots, a combination of both. Take the alarming sight of Ms. Jones, on the phone, pleading for two of her longtime collaborators, Sly & Robbie, to join her in the studio, as they apparently promised they would. She jokes — I think — about resorting to “emotional blackmail,” quoting herself covering Chrissie Hynde’s song “Private Life.”“Robbie? Robbie? Robbie,” she begs, with a polka dotted sweatshirt unwrapped on her head, her glorious, mysterious continental baritone on the brink of despair. Here we have the woman who played the formidable henchman May Day in the Bond film “A View to a Kill” and the freaky-deaky supermodel Strangé from the Eddie Murphy movie “Boomerang” — here we have Grace Jones! — trapped in a Lionel Richie song.In a movie about someone who has shown you everything, what you’re looking for is something you never expected to see. “Bloodlight and Bami” delivers. Ms. Jones shucks her own oysters — stressfully. She does her own make up and performs her own vexed yet amusing contract negotiations. She counsels, watches, listens and sort of kids around (“Heads are gonna roll,” she sings after one sour phone call).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018This isn’t a career retrospective or a treatise on the importance and wide influence of Grace Jones. (Someone should feel free to make either or both of those.) “Bloodlight and Bami” is all vérité. The director Sophie Fiennes began filming Ms. Jones in the mid-2000s and simply observes her on stage and off. She follows her home to Jamaica, where the diva mellows, almost unconsciously, into a daughter, sister and parishioner. She watches her record her 2008 album “Hurricane” and become a grandmother.There’s a trip to church where Ms. Jones’s brother, Noel, preaches and her mother sings “His Eye Is on the Sparrow.” There’s a night spent clubbing. Ms. Jones was in her mid-50s when the movie finds her and turns 70 next month. So for someone whose hits include the 1981 masterpiece of metaphor, “Pull Up to the Bumper,” and who was a fixture at New York’s Studio 54, her partying seems less like a splurge and more like a form of exercise.Ms. Fiennes makes the same investment in Ms. Jones that she’s made in the artist Anselm Kiefer and twice with the cultural philosopher Slavoj Zizek. This new movie isn’t as handsome or haunting as those. A lot of it feels caught on the fly. But Ms. Fiennes’ rigor operates in a different, more intimately transparent way. She enjoys Ms. Jones and her big, complicated family but is careful not to insert herself — or too much technique, for that matter — into family meals and various reminiscences between, say, Grace and a niece. Ms. Fiennes deploys her effects strategically, like for that night life sequence, which unfolds in slow-motion and without natural sound. Ms. Jones is at her most vampiric but also her most free.We’re not given any kind of chronology. We’re left to guess about what year it is or what city the shows are in. But concepts of time, space and location might actually be besides the point when your movie stars a Grace Jones who’s determined to look inward the way she does on “Hurricane,” the most obviously personal and autobiographical of her albums. There’s a long, lovely passage built around the conjuring, recording and live performance of the song “This Is.” And we watch Ms. Jones ruminate about the source of all that scariness and intimidation in her stage persona. It’s her abusive stepfather, and he’s got a hold on her still. This particular return to Jamaica appears to have stirred up a lot for her.Ms. Fiennes shrewdly juxtaposes all of that inner work with its outward expression, moving from conversations to concerts. At the shows, the camera is positioned from a distance that lets you take in all of Ms. Jones, whether she’s hula-hooping or stalking around the stage, in headdresses, helmets and masks. That low voice only seems to have gained power, weight and complexity. And the high point of experiencing the full of psychological effect might be during a performance of “Warm Leatherette,” a crashing, revved up rock song with a dance undergirding. Ms. Jones does it wearing a velvety bathing suit and a glittering mask while wielding a pair of giant cymbals that look a lot like shields.She’s filmed from the front and then from behind, at a low angle, so you can see the muscles in her back and the eternity of her legs. You can also see the concert hall and how it suddenly seems like a coliseum. Ms. Fiennes knows what she has in these shots — for one thing, a rebuke of some of the exploitative imagery created of Ms. Jones by her ex and former collaborator Jean-Paul Goude, who makes a short, memorable appearance. But Ms. Fiennes must also know that Ms. Jones embodies, here, a heightened version of what she always has been, a symbol of sex and strength, the pinup gladiator newly ready to reveal and defend herself."

She was put to death at 19, and most of the actors who have played the saint were well above that age. Most famously, Ingrid Bergman was 32 when she portrayed the 16-to-19-year-old Joan in a 1948 film. So it’s salutary that, with “Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc,” the writer and director Bruno Dumont casts two genuinely young performers to play Joan at key stages of her life.This is not the most unusual aspect of the film. “Jeannette” is also a musical, albeit a formally unconventional one. The characters do not break into song so much as adapt their declaiming styles to music when it crops up, which it does in a sometimes arbitrary way. As for the music, it would not be entirely accurate to call it “metal.” Yes, there are abundant power chords and intimations of guitar shredding, but the riffs draw on medieval folk and international modes like flamenco; the rhythms, often with prominent electronic micro-beats, recall dance-music genres like drum-and-bass.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018“Jeannette” has a small cast, and its production values are minimal compared to most period pictures. Mr. Dumont chose to shoot the movie in the North of France, not the Eastern Meuse region where Joan was from; late in the film, in a scene ostensibly set in winter, the cottage where Joan lives with her family is covered in thriving ivy. So certain aspects of verisimilitude are dispensed with, without making a big deal over it.What the movie is left with are the performers enacting the characters and their dilemmas. Lise Leplat Prudhomme, 8 years old at the time of filming, plays young Jeannette in 1425, the year she had her first vision. (Here, too, the director takes liberties, as most histories of Joan say she was 13 that year.) Skipping in a stream, she chants a variant of the Lord’s Prayer, bemoaning the fact that God’s name is “so far from being hallowed.” Mr. Dumont adapted his script largely from Charles Péguy’s late-19th-century poetic theater work “Jeanne d’Arc,” and the way the characters switch from speaking to singing, as well as the sparseness of the settings, sometimes give the work the feel of an oratorio.Except the characters don’t only sing, they dance, and in astonishing ways. Ms. Prudhomme twirls, cartwheels, stomps and headbangs, as does Jeanne Voisin later on as the teenage Jeanne, who’s dropped the “ette” from her name. It’s a bit funny, but it’s also more than that.Between the music and the dance, the temptation is to conclude that Mr. Dumont is trying to “modernize” Joan’s story, as she becomes determined to follow her visions and create an army to save France. Given that the very act of filming is a modernizing factor, that’s true in a sense. But his artistic aim is, I think, the inverse of that. “Jeannette” throws the modern back at the medieval, making no distinction between religious ecstasy and that experienced in certain contemporary contexts of music and ritual. It’s a provocative proposition that yields a film of genuine spiritual dimension."

Snared after unwisely accepting a stranger’s invitation to play, the friends (led by the TV stars Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey) are sequentially forced to tell a truth or accept a dare. But even if they spill every shameful secret and enact every vile instruction, their turn will eventually come around again.

Belonging to the fertile genre of “pampered Americans contract something icky from foreign travel,” it does nothing to cleanse Mr. Wadlow of the lingering stench of his 2013 effort, “Kick-Ass 2.” Even so, some setups can be unwittingly funny. When one character is dared to have sex with her best friend’s ultrahot boyfriend, several people at my screening were moved to comment loudly that the script’s notion of a dare was, at a minimum, problematic.Mostly, though, “Truth or Dare” is a wearying slog through crushed feelings and mangled bodies. So much so that when one poor soul was compelled to drive a ballpoint pen into his forehead, the temptation to emulate him was almost irresistible."

He even gave her injections to stunt her puberty.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018But those same genre tropes dictate that Anna will eventually leave her isolated cabin and meet other human beings, and perhaps even be temporarily, unconvincingly placed in the custody of a surrogate mother — in this case, a small-town sheriff named Ellen (Liv Tyler).Still, something strange is happening. Anna’s surprising strength, her speed at chasing wildlife, her habit of eating only the meat part of burgers — all signal that she is far from a textbook abuse case. And like Anna’s choice in meals, this creature feature from the director Fritz Böhm is functional but lacks flavor, an imaginative spark that might distinguish it from any number of other I-was-a-teenage-monster movies.Ms. Powley, continuing a track record of being better than her roles, is well suited to her character’s wide-eyed wonderment. Anna’s first outdoor encounter with sunlight, her interactions with high school classmates and her budding romantic interest in Ellen’s younger brother (Collin Kelly-Sordelet) make up the best scenes in the movie, which suffers as much as she does when she turns into a special effect."

He’s accused of war crimes for his actions in the former Yugoslavia, and though he’s itching to sneak outside, his associates demand that he squirrel away in a dusty apartment.

Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Hilmar have an easy chemistry and are a pleasure to watch as the cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, makes the most of the shadowy interiors and Serbian streets.The script, however, by the director, Brad Silberling, invites confusion by leaving too much unexplained and offering the barest minimum of action. It’s a slow-moving setup, with quirky dialogue (delivered, strangely, in British accents and idioms) that works against the story’s darker tone. A lackluster finale closes the movie on an unresolved note.Almost every other scene winds up the same way as Mr. Silberling keeps pulling back rather than pushing into riskier areas.

Taylor (Nick Robinson) is a teenager who lives with a condition called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, which means his heart beats abnormally fast during periods of stress.

He becomes a target for Krystal’s abusive ex-boyfriend (played by the rapper T.I.) and a cause for his art gallery boss (Kathy Bates) after she spies him at one of Krystal’s Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.Under the direction of the actor William H. Macy, who also plays Taylor’s father, “Krystal” has some of the qualities of sitcom television: It has a large ensemble cast and multiple concurrent story lines, and the writing and performance styles favor rhythm and energy over realism. But TV programs have seasons to develop their characters worthy of their all-star casts, and at 93 minutes “Krystal” feels chaotic and thin, like a pilot that was also forced to be a series finale. Instead of emotional depth, “Krystal” delivers speed, making Taylor’s heart race, but never the audience’s."

Further complicating matters are chauvinistic cultural traditions that can overrule religious dictates, resulting in adjudications that are fraught and combative.Undismayed, Ms. al-Faqih presides over a bustling courtroom in the West Bank (intimately filmed by the cinematographer Amber Fares, who directed the warmhearted documentary “Speed Sisters”). The proceedings are vexingly vague, serving mainly to highlight a personality at once firm and compassionate, sharp-witted and immune to male privilege. A visit with Ms. al-Faqih’s parents — who put almost all of their 12 of their children through college — is brief but revealing, as is footage of the judge educating a women’s group on their rights. In countries where domestic violence is viewed as a shameful private matter, and honor-killing excuses can be used to deflect a murder charge, women need all the help they can get.Against this backdrop of domestic strife, “The Judge” is, like its namesake, defiantly upbeat. Though voices both welcoming and hostile to women judges are represented, Ms. al-Faqih’s likely Sisyphean battle to reach her position feels insufficiently underlined. Her mettle is on full view, though, when a new chief justice tries to sideline her; quietly and patiently fighting back, she emerges as someone who’s no threat to religious law, but who’s a real problem for patriarchy."

That message might seem innocuous, but it challenged the beliefs of the congregants at his Tulsa megachurch, who regarded the position as heresy.Adapted, with the usual biopic dramatic liberties, from a “This American Life” episode that aired in 2005, Joshua Marston’s film begins in 1998, with Carlton Pearson (a superb Chiwetel Ejiofor) preaching about his efforts to sway a lawyer who sat next to him on a plane.But the movie soon begins to show his doubts. He declines to write to the prison board to help an uncle (Danny Glover). He confesses to his mentor Oral Roberts (Martin Sheen), who calls him his “black son,” that it seems foolish to spend time saving people he doesn’t know as opposed to people he does.Where Mr. Marston (“Maria Full of Grace”) locates most of the story’s nuance and power is in charting Carlton’s downfall, as congregants and friends begin to shun him for his views. (His wife, played by Condola Rashad, and a gay church musical director, an invented character played by Lakeith Stanfield, are notable exceptions.)While Marcus Hinchey’s screenplay is occasionally too blunt, “Come Sunday” accords sympathetic moments to all its characters — a strategy that gives this chronicle of religious convictions a conviction of its own."

Richard Conroy (voiced by Logan Lerman), and proved adept at the regimen, even managing a canine version of a salute.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018CreditCreditFun Academy Motion Pictures“As long as that dog soldiers like that, he’s as welcome as any man in this army,” a colonel says, in a sentiment typical of the movie, which watches as Stubby exceeds expectations again and again.

This may be the first cartoon in history designed for this particular overlap of audiences: military buffs and the very, very young."

The heroes and antiheroes of his films dart restlessly between continents, between planes spiritual and material, finding themselves with no direction home, if a home they ever had.In “Submergence” Mr. Wenders depicts two wandering souls who find each other, fall in love and part: one to explore the darkest depths of the Atlantic Ocean, the other to wind up chained in a windowless room, held captive by Somali jihadists.“Submergence” was adapted by the screenwriter Erin Dignam from J.M. Ledgard’s acclaimed novel of that name. The book is a romance, a thriller and a meditation on geopolitical conundrums, ideology, science and metaphysics. It is written in precise, refined, allusive prose. But Ms. Dignam’s script distills the novel into middlebrow Hollywood treacle.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018James McAvoy plays James, a British spy whose cover identity as a water engineer he extends to his personal life. Alicia Vikander is Danielle, a scientist. The two meet at a quiet, very high-end hotel on France’s Norman coast, where each is decompressing before a mission. When Danielle explains her work to James, he calls her an “oceanographer,” and she tells him there’s no such thing, really, as oceanography, and that she’s a bio-mathematician. Soon they are frolicking on a beach, albeit with some seriousness, around the relics of World War II.Showing the chemistry between these two characters in the boy-and-girl-fall-hard scenes is no problem for Mr. Wenders. Many of his pictures, including some of his greatest, are, to put it bluntly, swoony hymns to hetero-normativity. (See, for example, the finale of his 1987 “Wings of Desire.”) There’s a scene in this film in which James and Danielle chat in a wooded area, and the way Mr. Wenders frames the characters, the shadows of tree branches falling on their attractive faces, and how he makes the sound of a light wind prominent under their conversation, casts an intimate spell. Which is what cinema is supposed to do, arguably.Unfortunately the director does not succeed nearly as well in other areas of his endeavor. Once the lovers are separated, their parallel stories are intercut to increasingly diffuse effect. James, having lied to Danielle about his destination — he tells her he’s going to Kenya — is cut off from the outside world upon being captured. So Danielle, on a research vessel about to embark on a monumental journey, gets to be the moony one, constantly looking at her smartphone as James fails to text. (The vessel is called L’Atalante in the movie — Mr. Wenders’s nod to the famous Jean Vigo film by that name.)The imbalance is arguably sexist, but it also has the effect of skewing all the film’s metaphors so as to render them close to meaningless. Mr. McAvoy’s man of action (though one who’s almost immediately stymied) is hardly the quintessential Wenders protagonist — that guy is the sulky fellow alone in a room with his stereo, muttering along to the Kinks’ “Too Much on My Mind” (from the classic 1977 “The American Friend”).Mr. Wenders’s camera finds more affinity for Ms. Vikander, even as the narrative lists toward the mounting calamities in Somalia, and James’s struggles to survive them. The movie feints in the direction of confronting horrific geopolitical realities, but there’s a specter of sentimentality hovering above the proceedings, waiting to smother everything in sight. The movie’s final images could be characterized as signaling a failure of nerve, except that would presume that “Submergence” had any real nerve to begin with."

In several long, crucial scenes in the middle of “The Rider,” Chloé Zhao’s beautiful second feature, we look on as a young man named Brady Blackburn trains horses, including Apollo, a stubborn and high-spirited colt. A rodeo champion recovering from a serious head injury, Brady understands the animals in a way that suggests both long practice and natural intuition. His total absorption in the task at hand, his graceful combination of discipline and talent, his unshowy confidence in his own skills — all of these are signs that we are watching an artist at work.Make that two artists. Ms. Zhao’s commitment to her craft — she knows how to take care and when to take risks — matches Brady’s. She has an eye for landscape and an acute sensitivity to the nuances of storytelling, a bold, exacting vision that makes “The Rider” exceptional among recent American regional-realist films. (Ms. Zhao wrote the screenplay; the cinematographer is Joshua James Richards.) Like her debut, “Songs My Brothers Taught Me,” it is alive with empathy and devoid of pity or condescension. There is struggle and disappointment in Brady’s life, but rather than pin him and the other characters down in a tableau of misery, Ms. Zhao honors their essential freedom and understands what is important to them.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018The movie takes place on the wide, windy Dakota prairie, where Brady (Brady Jandreau) lives in a trailer with his sister, Lilly (Lilly Jandreau), and their father, Wayne (Tim Jandreau). The actors are nonprofessionals playing versions of themselves — members of a Native American family that has seen its share of hardship. Brady and Lilly, who has an intellectual disability, lost their mother to cancer a few years before. More recently, Brady’s skull was fractured by a bronco in the ring, leaving him with a frightening scar on the side of his head and neurological damage that causes seizures in his right hand. “No more rodeos and no more riding,” a doctor warns, and it’s clear that the injury to Brady’s head has also wounded his morale and his sense of who he is.And so he grapples with grief, denial and the dreadful feeling that his life is shutting down before it really got started. But he also embraces the pleasures and responsibilities that are part of that new, diminished life: working at the local supermarket, managing the household when Wayne isn’t around, looking out for Lilly, hanging out with his rodeo buddies.Their evenings around the campfire or at the bar, trading banter and rodeo stories, connect these young men, who proudly see themselves as both Indians and cowboys, with the iconography of the American West. “The Rider” isn’t really a western, but the genre is part of the air it breathes.ImageMs. Zhao, who also wrote the screenplay for “The Rider,” has an eye for landscape.CreditSony Pictures ClassicsBrady is lean and taciturn. His way of talking expresses the stoicism of someone who has been told to “cowboy up” in the face of adversity, but there is also a gentle patience about him. Mr. Jandreau may not have much acting experience, but he has more than a touch of movie-star charisma, that mysterious, unteachable power to hold the screen and galvanize the viewer’s attention.From time to time, Brady visits his friend Lane (Lane Scott), whose exploits in and out of the rodeo ring have made him a legend among the other riders. Lane is now paralyzed and unable to speak. Brady helps him with physical therapy exercises that mimic sitting up in the saddle and holding onto the reins. They watch old videos of memorable rides, and their refusal to feel sorry for themselves makes their scenes together all the more heartbreaking.“The Rider,” for the most part, resists both the urge to wallow in sadness and the impulse to deny it. There are a few scenes in which the dialogue does work that would have been better left to the faces of the performers and the details of their environment. We don’t need to hear Brady say to Wayne, “I hope I don’t end up like you.” The fear that he might is present in every glance that passes between father and son. But so is the understanding that Wayne is not only a cautionary figure, battered by loss and disappointment, prone to drinking and gambling and squandering money. He is also a role model, who understands the value of love, loyalty and letting things slide from time to time.What Brady will become is an open question, a source of considerable suspense and emotion. Wayne falls back on the gambler’s truism about playing the hand you’ve been dealt, but that advice is more complicated than it sounds, and in any case rodeo isn’t like poker. You can’t really bluff or fold. You just hold on for as long as you can, trusting your nerve, your skill and your horse sense."

If you remember the Big Game in question, then you walk into the theater with a spoiler in your pocket. But if you don’t, you might not care much in the first place. And besides, the internet being what it is and the made-for-cable sports documentaries being what they are (which is generally pretty good), you might be less than thrilled at the prospect of watching actors impersonate world-class athletes.On the other hand, in the face of such odds, it’s hard to root against “Borg vs. McEnroe,” an engaging feature-length response to the trivia question “Who won the Wimbledon men’s singles title in 1980?” The answer is one of the two players named in the film’s title, rivals whose contrasting styles and temperaments made their confrontation especially exciting.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018Bjorn Borg, a taciturn Swede with a two-fisted backhand and steady baseline game, had won Wimbledon four times. At 24, he had already secured a place among the sport’s greats. John McEnroe, a volatile, quick-footed American with a peppery serve-and-volley style, would eventually join those ranks, too. At the time, though, he was a 21-year-old brat, as famous for his on-court tantrums as for his drop shots.As McEnroe, Shia LaBeouf pulls off a remarkable feat of underacting. (No, that is not a sentence I ever thought I’d write.) The eruptions happen, but they are byproducts of a temperament defined more by insecurity than by aggression. We see more seething than storming, and we are aware of watching a young person in the unruly process of emergence (a description that could apply to both the character and the actor).McEnroe is immature and impulsive and not especially nice, but for all his theatrics — the press loves to cover his outbursts — he is not the dramatic center of the movie. That is Borg, played by Sverrir Gudnason (and by Leo Borg, Bjorn’s son, and Marcus Mossberg in flashbacks to his early life) as a man whose apparent calm is purchased at an enormous, potentially tragic price.ImageMr. Gudnason as Bjorn Borg.CreditNeonThe filmmakers — Janus Metz directed, from a screenplay by Ronnie Sandahl — focus on the melancholy Swede, perhaps out of Scandinavian pride and perhaps because they believe his still waters run deep. Though “Borg vs. McEnroe” visits the childhoods of both players, it spends more time following Borg’s path. A working-class boy trying to break into the genteel world of Swedish tennis, he was kicked out of a club for bad sportsmanship and prone to exactly the kind of racket-throwing, foul-mouthed displays that would bring McEnroe, a rich kid from Long Island, such notoriety.McEnroe recognizes this hidden kinship, noting that the grown-up Borg is not an iceberg but a volcano. Borg’s ability to suppress any emotion and to play with ruthless, machine-like discipline is the result of his relationship with his trainer, Lennart Bergelin (Stellan Skarsgard, playing a variation on his “Good Will Hunting” monomaniacal mentor role). Bergelin discovers the young prodigy and pushes him toward greatness, but by the summer of 1980 the pressure is starting to take its toll. Borg’s relationship with his fiancée, Mariana Simionescu (Tuva Novotny), is strained, and his mental health seems to be precarious.And so, after a few excursions into high-style period kitsch — a visit to a disco, vintage haircuts and track suits, glimpses of Vitas Gerulaitis (Robert Emms) and Jimmy Connors (Tom Datnow) — we settle in for the big match, wondering whose composure will crack. The game is remarkably exciting to watch, a sign (like the climactic contest between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King reconstructed in “Battle of the Sexes”) that movies may at last be ready for tennis. That seems to be a result of advances in digital editing and image-making that allow the actors to be inserted seamlessly into the action.You’re still always aware of the artifice, which is part of the fun. Nothing too grand or grave is at stake here. No special cultural or historical importance can be derived from the Borg-McEnroe battle, but sports don’t always carry that kind of significance. “Borg vs. McEnroe” is a modest, tactful movie about two guys who, at their peak, were neither."

The story of how, over 30 years after its debut, a relatively innocent arcade game starring a giant ape and other oversize beasts underwent a corporate transmogrification and became a turgid, logy sci-fi/action blockbuster.It is unlikely that such a film will be made; instead, this week, we just have that turgid, logy blockbuster. “Rampage,” based on the 1986 arcade game, stars Dwayne Johnson as the primatologist Davis Okoye, who signs with animals and has a special bond with an albino silverback gorilla named George (he knows how to make crude gestures at Davis). George is destined for gianthood, and for unusual aggression, thanks to a genetic experiment that goes haywire.VideoThe director Brad Peyton narrates an action sequence from “Rampage,” featuring Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.Published OnApril 19, 2018CreditCreditWarner Bros.The movie’s opening scene, which is also the best action set piece in this Brad Peyton-directed picture, depicts the lone survivor of a space station catastrophe trying to return to Earth with her scientific samples intact. This doesn’t work out. Instead the bad gene stuff winds up hitting ecosystems across this great nation, yielding a giant wolf, a giant crocodile and a giant (and now mean) George.The mutated animals are soon making a beeline for Chicago, whence the bad guys are summoning the creatures. (They have also been genetically programmed to respond to a particular radio signal.) The rather dim villains, Claire and Brett, are a sister and brother team played by Malin Akerman and Jake Lacy. At one point Claire says: “Lucky for us our building has some of the most powerful radio antennae on the face of the earth.” (Another dialogue gem goes like this: “Colonel, what everybody needs to understand is that we’re no longer dealing with a wolf and a gorilla.” The movie has four credited screenwriters.)As for Mr. Johnson, one hesitates to level a charge of “phoning it in” against him. He’s a generally reliable performer, but I have to say it seems he had less fun here than he did in the recent “Jumanji.” The special effects are only distinguished by a peculiar concern for verisimilitude — the initially snowy George gets really dirty on his way to Chicago, while the unnamed giant wolf appears to be suffering from mange."

The movie recommends a look “that focuses on the details and disregards the surface message without losing sight of it.”The study of this period of filmmaking is hardly new, and the director, Rüdiger Suchsland, quotes influential theorists like Siegfried Kracauer, Hannah Arendt and Susan Sontag. (“From Caligari to Hitler,” Mr. Kracauer’s landmark analysis of Weimar-era cinema as a reflection of national attitudes, served as a basis for a previous documentary by Mr. Suchsland.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018What “Hitler’s Hollywood” offers are the movies themselves. To see them today is to encounter an alternate universe of studio filmmaking that was itself designed to present an alternate universe, in which every death was happy and even escapist musicals emphasized the fascist ideal of total synchronization. The documentary shows how the industry had its own imitation of Sherlock Holmes and a 1930s precursor to “Lawrence of Arabia,” and found analogues for stars and directors like Marlene Dietrich and Ernst Lubitsch, who had departed Germany.Perhaps more troublingly for cinephiles, in the 1930s the state-controlled film industry also provided a training ground for Douglas Sirk — whose first American production, the terrific anti-Nazi film “Hitler’s Madman,” goes unacknowledged here — and Ingrid Bergman, who starred in one film in Germany. The documentary describes her role in “Casablanca” as “a sort of atonement.”Not all the insights are equally persuasive, but some of the strongest focus on cinematic technique — how wipes and cross-fades “created an unrealistic atmosphere in which everything became relative.” And if Weimar cinema provided a psychological X-ray of the German populace, as Mr. Kracauer argued, then Mr. Suchsland posits Veit Harlan’s mega-production “Kolberg,” released in 1945, as a kitschy mirror for the crashing and burning of the Nazis’ ambitions.Is it immoral to watch this material? Part of what’s alarming about “Hitler’s Hollywood” is that it’s easier to be seduced by these comedies and melodramas, at least in excerpts, than it is to endure Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda film “Triumph of the Will” today. The most charged implication of “Hitler’s Hollywood” is that artistry enabled the Third Reich."

The major studios don’t produce many leading roles for actors like Mr. Hamm, adults who would look even more unhappy in a Batman get-up than Ben Affleck does. But Mr. Hamm was of course perfect for “Mad Men,” where I always saw him as a somewhat sinister variation on old-Hollywood stars like John Gavin, one of those tall, dark and handsome squares the 1960s made obsolete. Mr. Hamm looked so ridiculously, perfectly cast as Don Draper that it took me a while to see that he was actually working.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 3, 2018Mr. Hamm is the main reason to see “Beirut,” in which he plays Mason Skiles, a former American diplomat who, a decade after retiring, is swept up again in a complex Middle Eastern intrigue. A grown-up superhero type — drawn closer to a world-weary John le Carré operative than a savior hatched by Tom Clancy — Mason has serious, somewhat opaque skills, a heavy political history and a lot of mileage on his soul. He’s a mystery of a kind, a puzzle to work out in tandem with the larger story, a rubric of deception involving warring interests and populated by gangs of sweaty, heavily armed men.Some of the sweatiest, most dangerous are the Americans camped out in the fiery wreckage of Beirut whom Mason warily joins. Back in 1972, the year that Richard M. Nixon was re-elected president and the Watergate story broke, Mason had been living the good life in Beirut, apparently at ease in his cosmopolitan bubble. Catastrophic violence upended his life, sending him back to the States, where, drowning in alcohol, he sleepwalks through work as a union negotiator. Now, seven years into the Lebanese civil war, Mason is summoned back to Beirut to help broker the release of a kidnapped C.I.A. agent.The screenwriter Tony Gilroy, best known for the “Bourne” franchise (he also wrote and directed “Michael Clayton”), has a knack for twisty thrillers that personalize the political. “Beirut” is a slower moving and less propulsive distant cousin to that series; Mason isn’t a spy, for starters, and he talks rather than fights or motorcycles his way out of trouble. His most obvious superhuman talent, at least until the story gets its game on, seems to be an ability to consume prodigious amounts of booze without obvious consequences. But like Bourne, Mason is burdened by history — his own and that of the United States — which means that his mission is at once inwardly and outwardly directed.ImageMr. Hamm in “Beirut.”CreditMohammed Kamal/Bleecker StreetAfter some narrative time-and-space hopscotching, Mason lands in Beirut and the story settles into focus. He takes a grim, unscenic tour of the city’s devastation (with Morocco standing in for war-ravaged Lebanon), and meets some demonstrably frosty friendlies from the C.I.A. and the State Department. Amid the introductions and sneers — the kidnapped C.I.A. agent has been taken by a very active, murderous terrorist group — some of the Americans give Mason the stink eye and a jittery C.I.A. operative (Rosamund Pike) settles in for perilous babysitting duties. (The fine supporting cast also includes Larry Pine, Shea Whigham and an appropriately unsettling Jonny Coyne.)The director Brad Anderson adeptly handles the story’s many parts, the dealing and dealers, the jittery car trips and late-night machinations. Some of this is very familiar, namely the white American abroad who, while navigating the churn of dangerously competing interests (largely American, Israeli and Palestinian), is unpacking a lot of personal baggage in a world that never comes into satisfying, humanizing focus. For the most part, the non-Israeli Middle Eastern characters (one exception is given a pulse by Idir Chender) are relegated to negligible roles. They’re the anonymous passers-by, partygoers and guards overseeing the city’s makeshift checkpoints with machine guns.The absence of Arab voices beyond those of the terrorists further flattens a movie that never fully takes satisfying shape. Part of the problem is that the story keeps slinking away from politics, opting to poke around in American geopolitical self-interest while always returning to its protagonist, who’s as much a casualty of that self-interest as a perpetrator. Mr. Hamm certainly makes it easy to care for Mason and all that he signifies, and it’s a pleasure to watch him just silently nurse another drink, a lifetime of regret weighing on him. Yet as Mason sits alone, the shadows closing around him, you also catch sight of a character whose past — including a cozy association with Henry Kissinger — suggests a tougher, harder and more interesting movie than the one you are watching."

For the most part, the director Andrew Haigh hangs back from Charley (the intensely sympathetic Charlie Plummer), preferring to show him in his world. It is a hard place, petty and mean and sometimes brutal. And the tall, coltish Charley is only 15, which, because he’s so very good at self-preservation, can be easy to forget as he slides deeper into calamity. And, then, it’s always easier to pretend we don’t see the Charleys around us.A coming-of-age story that unfolds gradually, “Lean on Pete” takes place in what the writer Michael Harrington called “the invisible land” of the poor, a reality too little seen in American movies. Charley and his father, Ray (Travis Fimmel), have recently moved from Spokane, Wash., to Portland, Ore., and are living in a cramped house with worn furniture and unpacked boxes. For them, life isn’t shaped by blue skies and unthinking privileges like cellphones or even a real bed for Charley, but by a patchwork of miserly paychecks, rundown rentals and missed meals. Ray is doggedly independent, but no one is looking out for them, either. He also has a habit of disappearing, leaving the fridge to quickly empty.Mr. Haigh, whose movies include “45 Years” and “Weekend,” makes this world and its contradictions palpable, showing you both the empty cans littering the yard and the care with which Charley unpacks his trophies. Ray has a new job and distraction (Amy Seimetz), but Charley has next to nothing. (His mother ran off long ago, joining the ranks of fiction’s conveniently absent women.) Father and son love each other, although Ray can be terrifyingly careless with Charley. Even when they’re together they seem apart, the distance between them visible in Mr. Haigh’s staging and framing and in Charley’s needy, hesitant glances at his father. (Mr. Plummer’s physical delicacy can look like fragility.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018Based on Willy Vlautin’s 2010 novel of the same title, “Lean on Pete” takes off when Charley discovers the local track. It’s there that he meets Del (Steve Buscemi), a vile, cantankerous owner who runs his horses into the ground and who, with his arm in a cast, begrudgingly hires Charley for odd jobs. He takes to the work eagerly, and Mr. Haigh digs into this chapter nicely, catching the light filtering through the stables and adding the textured details that turn movies into lived-in places. More important, the track is where Charley meets a pretty quarter horse named Lean on Pete, whose velvety brown coat and barely audible whinnies become a balm for the lonely teenager.Quarter horses are sprinters, but there’s not much running and even less winning left in Pete. Del races Pete on the fair circuit, but also hauls him long distances to bleak, makeshift tracks where the horses are separated from onlookers by a length of rope. It’s a long way from the money and putative excitement of thoroughbred racing with its celebrity horses, hall-of-fame jockeys and millions of dollars in bets. Here, the animal abuse is more open and shrugged off, and its consequences are blunt. “Horses aren’t pets,” a jockey named Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny) cautions Charley, a warning that he ignores and that further unsettles the already fraught atmosphere.Disaster violently upends and gives shape to the loose, episodic story when an angry stranger breaks down Ray and Charley’s front door, sending the father to the hospital and the son reeling. With no one else he can call, Charley runs off to look for a missing aunt, stealing both Del’s truck and Pete. They share starry nights — Charley talks to Pete as if confiding in a friend — but their difficult road soon turns treacherous. There are ominous men, kind women, persistent hunger, a desert trek, a breakdown and a grisly accident. Before long, this tough-minded if generous-hearted movie becomes nearly unbearable as its overarching ethic of honesty edges too close to sadism.This has more to do with Mr. Haigh’s fealty to the source material (he also wrote the script), which stacks the decks high against Charley, than with his filmmaking, which retains an insistent if restrained intimacy that feels like compassion. At times, the only tenderness in Charley’s life seems to be the soft light that folds around him like a blanket. The loveliness of the images in these moments eases the trauma that threatens to engulf him and the movie. (The director of photography is Magnus Nordenhof Jonck.) There’s almost a cosmic dimension to some of the most beautiful passages, as if the world (call it nature or God or sensitive direction) were holding Charley in its embrace.This visual beauty can seem at odds with the story’s ugliness but is as necessary as it is welcome because it gives you something to hold onto even as Charley slips further, grubbing meals, fending off violence. Steve Zahn shows up later in the movie, and while it’s always nice to see him, he proves, like its other indie-film veterans, somewhat of a distracting presence. That’s a minor complaint about a very fine movie that I haven’t stopped thinking about since I saw it, partly because stories about forgotten and mistreated children tend to be reserved for documentaries and foreign-language art cinema. In American movies, children get roughed up plenty, but rarely by poverty."

The first half documents work in a Serbian copper mine whose employees toil daily, sometimes for years, in an environment where “it is always night,” as one says. The second half takes place in the Surinamese jungle, where miners of a different sort dig and pan for gold.The settings and the workers are, in a sense, opposites. The Serbian mine is terrifyingly claustrophobic; the muddy shores in Suriname couldn’t be more open-air. The Serbians are white, the Surinamese black. The first group works in a state-owned mine, the second without obvious oversight.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 29, 2018The phrase “good luck” is uttered in both contexts, with different connotations, but the subjects’ desperation, dreams and camaraderie become unifying threads. In both parts, Mr. Russell periodically cuts to black-and-white shots of individual workers looking at the camera, portrait-style. Elsewhere, he tends to emphasize their collective activity.Both halves feature breathtaking camera work. Early in the Serbian segment, workers crammed into an elevator descend into the depths of the mine; the shot mirrors a famous sequence in Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” There’s so little light that what’s visible sometimes appears in a porthole-like dot onscreen.In Suriname, Mr. Russell films the morning mist with a Monet-like abstraction and executes remarkable Steadicam shots through the mud. He might be accused of making poverty poetry — except that both sites’ unlikely beauty, too, may be a connecting thread."

With their new film, “The Endless,” they take a few unusual risks. “The Endless” revisits the setting and some of the situations from “Resolution,” their 2013 feature debut. In that movie Mr. Benson and Mr. Moorhead appeared in small roles as members of a U.F.O. cult. Here, they are the leads, telling a continued story of those characters.As the movie opens, Justin and Aaron (the filmmakers play characters named after themselves) are out of the cult but stuck in dead-end existences. Aaron has fond memories of the meals at what he calls “the commune” in the California hills. Justin has to remind him that all the men there endure ritual castrations. Nevertheless, Justin agrees to drive Aaron there for a one-day visit.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018CreditCreditWell Go USAThis idea may at first seem both dumb and highly implausible, but viewers eager to poke holes in the scenario should give it time. “The Endless” rewards patience with mind-bending twists and turns. The movie is shot in a realistic, grounded style that makes the unusual characterizations credible and the insane events convincing. How insane? Justin finds a shed with a hanged man in it. He is then confronted by that same man, alive, who instructs Justin to retrieve a gun for him, so he might properly kill himself. It all does make a kind of sense, and if you enjoyed the recent “Annihilation,” this movie provides a similar cosmic horror trip."

Set in Alice Springs, Australia, in 1929, the movie tracks the fate of Sam (a fine Hamilton Morris), an Aboriginal stockman forced to flee after killing a white farmer in self-defense.Around this spare story, though, the director Warwick Thornton constructs a searing indictment of frontier racism as remarkable for its sonic restraint as its visual expansiveness. The opening shot might be a metaphorical mallet — a cauldron of water slowly coming to the boil while a violent, slur-slathered argument plays out offscreen — but the coarseness is in keeping with the movie’s pointed, symbolic style.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018Wrapping colonialism in the cloak of the western (and revisiting themes explored in his 2010 film “Samson and Delilah”), Mr. Thornton stirs those familiar genre tropes into new patterns. As Sam and his wife (Natassia Gorey-Furber) trek across desert and salt flat — painted in vivid swaths of ocher and ice — he outwits his pursuers at every turn. Tricked into entering tribal lands, the small posse, led by a stoically vengeful Bryan Brown, is repelled by vicious warriors. But even Sam isn’t safe here: for men like him, virtually enslaved, their only home is the in-between.Soulful and still, but never inert, “Sweet Country,” like its setting, has little time for women’s voices. Yet the movie has a mythic thrust that’s partly due to its almost playful manipulation of time, its silent flash-forwards lending the story a feeling of futility and predetermination. As foreboding and memory rub shoulders, we can’t help feeling that, for Sam and his ilk, no amount of guile will ever be enough."

That is the movie’s big joke, and while it sounds positively antediluvian it also brings to mind news reports that the Trump administration plans to introduce abstinence-only education this summer. According to the website The Hill, the idea is to emphasize “sexual delay,” which sounds like the title of a song that Marvin Gaye never recorded. The world has a way of killing the mood, if you let it.Thinking too hard and long about a would-be laugh-in like “Blockers” isn’t usually the best idea, of course. The point is to sit back and enjoy it, no matter how sporadic or familiar the jokes. That’s the case with the lighthearted, eager-to-please “Blockers,” which features an innocuously pleasant cast of middle-age professional goofballs and a rather less-funny collection of dewy young cuties. As expected, while the daughters and their dates frolic, the parents regress. They yell, fall, run in circles, and flap their hands and mouths. One also partakes in an inadvisable practice you can learn about by typing the words alcohol enema in your browser.VideoKay Cannon narrates a sequence from “Blockers,” featuring Ike Barinholtz, John Cena and Leslie Mann.Published OnApril 5, 2018CreditCreditUniversal PicturesThe parents, Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter (Leslie Mann, John Cena and best in show, Ike Barinholtz), have done a bang-up job with their kids. Their three high school daughters, lifelong friends, are smart, social, happy, healthy and dull. Because they’re exceedingly, grindingly average, they hatch up a plan to have sex with three boys on prom night. And because the screenwriters Brian Kehoe and James Kehoe haven’t worked nearly as hard as they should have, Lisa’s daughter, Julie (Kathryn Newton), leaves her laptop vulnerable to parental prying. Enter Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter, who, after breaking the teenage emoji code in one of the movie’s cleverer bits, plot and deploy. High jinks and slapstick ensue.Making her feature directing debut, Kay Cannon (who wrote the “Pitch Perfect” comedies) handles all the nonsense in “Blockers” just fine, alternately corralling the performers and giving them room to cut very modestly loose. (The other daughters are played by Geraldine Viswanathan and Gideon Adlon, both charmers.) Ms. Cannon doesn’t give the movie a discernible look beyond the strictly utilitarian, relying on the usual scene setting as well as lots and lots of shots of people talking and not moving nearly enough in the frame. The movie takes place in a Chicago that might as well be a studio lot, with generically attractive houses that look middle class only by Hollywood standards.“Blockers” is sloppy, sentimental and too good-natured to take serious issue with, which is generally true of the other comedies that Seth Rogen’s production company has had a hand in. It isn’t as ridiculous as “Sausage Party” and lacks the dark, uneasy energy of the apocalyptic “This Is the End,” but it’s passably diverting. Like those movies, “Blockers” feels as if it was made by people who believe in kindness, friendship and smut that’s one giggle away from an old Playboy joke page. It features a casually diverse cast and is openly, at times dutifully, feminist, with you-go-girl speeches that sound as if everyone involved had tried too hard to be decent. Funny and enlightened would have been better.The most notable thing about “Blockers” is how aggressively square it is, despite its wagging genitals and flashes of what, at this point in screen comedy, feels like pro forma raunchiness. It’s predictable that no one comes across as remotely real, although Hunter, who carries the banner for bad parenting, at least suggests a person. But no one is weird, unsurprising, a little off, truly freaky. Ms. Mann’s hyperkinetic vibe and slightly bonkers smile are promising, but both are in service to a movie that insists on just nice ’n’ naughty. That’s too bad, because when Lisa and Julie sit in front of their TV — eating off matching trays with matching mad smiles — I flashed on “Grey Gardens” and sighed."

From lighting to music cues, “The Miracle Season” never misses a chance to lunge for your tear ducts, treating its characters less as flesh-and-blood humans than as props for delivering bromides.Directed by Sean McNamara, “The Miracle Season” recounts the journey of the Iowa City West High School girls’ volleyball team, whose star player, Caroline Found (Danika Yarosh), known as Line, died in a moped accident in August 2011, shortly before her mother (Jillian Fargey) died of cancer.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 27, 2018Line’s absence leaves the team members barely able to brush their teeth, as their coach, Kathy Bresnahan (Helen Hunt), who wrote a book of the same title, puts it. She and Caroline’s friend Kelley Fliehler (Erin Moriarty) must help them defend a state championship.Yet moment after moment feels calculated. The way Line’s parting glance with Kelley is filmed signals that this won’t be a temporary separation. The movie trivializes the team’s endurance by relegating a lengthy winning streak to a montage. No one’s hair gets too mussed. Those announcing and reporting on the games need sensitivity training.“I may be the surgeon, but you’re the healer out there,” Line’s father (William Hurt), a doctor, advises Kelley at one point. Even if he said that, it’s too purple on screen."

There’s only a single hospital in this region, and there’s only a single surgeon on the staff.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018He is Tom Catena, an American who since 2007 has been tending Mother of Mercy Hospital, which he also helped found. This film is more about Dr. Catena and his work than the appalling political situation that keeps Mr. Bashir in power and restricts United Nations humanitarian aid and outside nongovernmental organizations from assisting the people of the Nuba. It’s tempting to call Dr. Catena a living saint. Numerous surgeries, which he performs with kindness and patience, are depicted in detail. The doctor works impossible hours, serving a population of one million. When he’s not working as a doctor, he is, say, reroofing the facility. In lengthy interviews he speaks of how he found his calling.Dr. Catena rarely loses his cool, but when he gets angry, it’s at the larger problem, not the patients or the staff members. In one moment of near-despair, he says, “Why do we have to listen to a criminal regime that bombs and kills its own people?”The film is worth seeing because it’s a moving and remarkable story and it represents a great cause. Mr. Carlson often puts a directorial foot wrong, as when Dr. Catena comes down with malaria and the director tries to construct a fever dream sequence from previously seen footage. Bad idea."

Or did he? A few moody flashbacks and daydreams are presumably intended to add to the noirish sense of uncertainty and unease, but instead of intensifying the mystery, they dissipate it. As much as we’re supposed to be intrigued by Evan’s high-minded self-pity, the truth of the matter won’t be anything so profound."

Even today, the organization, whose full name was Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, is probably most associated with the 2008 election, when John McCain and conservative groups accused it of voter registration fraud, and with a subsequent scandal in 2009, when secretly recorded videos suggested that Acorn’s employees had encouraged illegal activity.In 2010, Clark Hoyt, then The New York Times’s public editor, wrote a detailed analysis of the situation.

Bertha Lewis, Acorn’s final chief executive, emphasizes the tough work that Acorn did. The material about Acorn’s history is necessary to the film’s purpose, but it’s not especially compelling.More engaging are the rationalizations of Hannah Giles, who made the sting videos with James O’Keefe, a fellow conservative activist.

Played with concentrated minimalism by Michelle Pfeiffer, she is the downtrodden subject of Andrew Dosunmu’s new film, “Where Is Kyra?”A lengthy shot early in the movie shows part of Kyra’s daily routine as she takes care of her elderly, ailing mother (Suzanne Shepherd). The camera provides a view of both the mother’s bedroom and the bathroom. Kyra slowly moves her halting mother into the bathroom, undresses her and helps her into the tub.There’s very little light in the shot. (The cinematographer is Bradford Young, whose low-key approach has paid dividends in recent films like “Arrival” and “A Most Violent Year.”) Much of this movie is literally hard to see, and deliberately so. Remember “dirty realism,” the label some critics applied in the 1980s to the work of writers like Richard Ford and Jayne Anne Phillips? “Where Is Kyra?” operates in the realm of begrimed realism — its dark depths are purgatorial, if not outright hellish.It’s when Kyra’s mother dies that her own story really begins. She’s out of work, out of money and short on supportive friends and relatives. She soon acquires a hardscrabble but kind new boyfriend (Kiefer Sutherland) but keeps her struggles from him.Despite the realism of its milieu and the events, this film is highly stylized. The opening title doesn’t appear until 20 minutes into it, in big block letters. Some scenes are scored to bursts of harsh electro-acoustic music. The underpopulated bar where Kyra meets Mr. Sutherland’s character seems desolate enough to be the set for a staging of “No Exit.” These touches need to be calibrated with exactitude, lest they come off as arty affectations. Mr. Dosunmu doesn’t quite achieve that. Still, as a statement about the economic insecurity inherent in American capitalism, “Where Is Kyra?” has grim power."

Possessed of craniums that roll open to expose a pulsing, wet membrane, they’re like skittering ear holes with pointy teeth and clattering appendages. Drawing from a variety of heritage horrors, including “Alien” and “Predator,” their design is familiar yet effective, their origin kept shrouded. Extraterrestrial beings or man-made weapons gone rogue, they’re a mystery whose source the movie wisely recognizes as irrelevant.Employing a narrative shorthand of news clippings, briefly whispered exchanges and critically placed devices — like a tiny oxygen mask to silence the new baby, and good luck with that — Mr. Krasinski (who helped write the screenplay) directs with skill and restraint. He knows that when the sound is turned down, we lean in, and he forces us to pay attention to facial expressions in a way that hearing audiences are rarely required to do. Welcoming this scrutiny, the actors emote like champs: Watching Ms. Simmonds cycle through hurt, doubt, anger and acceptance is one of the movie’s singular pleasures.ImageEmily Blunt in the film, which was directed by Mr. Krasinski.CreditParamount PicturesPhotographed by Charlotte Bruus Christensen in soft, slightly faded tones that suggest a world slowly being erased, this stripped-down thriller operates from a central conceit that’s far from uncommon. From “The Walking Dead” to the Emmy-nominated “Hush,” a 1999 episode of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” in which spindly supernatural killers steal people’s voices, the relationship between silence and survival has been repeatedly explored. More recently, movies like “It Follows” and “The Babadook” have used the absence of sound to create dreamy sequences that throb with unspoken menace.Taking this device to an extreme that feels strangely novel, Mr. Krasinski imposes rigorous restrictions on his cast and crew that produce unexpectedly sensual benefits. The countryside around the farm is a symphony of wind and waterfall and rustling leaves; the production design inside the farmhouse is warm and intimate and crammed with evidence of the family’s intricate strategies to minimize risk. And the full-on action sequences, staged with stalking tension in settings as diverse as a grain silo and a bathtub, are nervily potent.ImageThe children, played by Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, communicate with their parents using sign language in “The Quiet Place.”CreditParamount PicturesNeither intellectually deep nor even logically sound (press any soft spot and the whole plot caves in), “A Quiet Place” feels at odds with a musical score that too often wants to tell us when to jump, and how high. Yet in its convincing portrayal of a situation where a rusty nail is as lethal as an unexploded bomb, and the few remaining inhabitants seem — much like the audience — more likely to die of stress than anything else, the movie rocks. You may go in jaded, but you’ll leave elated or I’ll eat my words."

The ongoing, morbid fascination with all things Kennedy is an aspect of American culture I find perplexing and somewhat dispiriting. Compulsive Kennedyism encourages our unfortunate habit of substituting mythology for history, of dissolving the complexities of American political life into airy evocations of idealism and tragedy. The lives and deaths of Kennedy family members provide grist for endless conspiracy theorizing, tabloid salaciousness, celebrity-worship and superstition. A movie about one of the sadder, tawdrier episodes in the saga could only feed this syndrome.But it turns out that “Chappaquiddick,” directed by John Curran from a script by the first-timers Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, is more diagnosis than symptom. Forsaking sensationalism for sober, procedural storytelling, the film examines the toxic effects of the Kennedy mystique on a handful of people involved in a fatal car crash in the summer of 1969.The basic facts are hardly obscure. Late on the night of July 18, an Oldsmobile driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy ran off a bridge on an island near Martha’s Vineyard and plunged into a pond. Mary Jo Kopechne, a former aide to the senator’s brother Robert, died inside the car. Kennedy waited until the next day to report the incident and provided an account that was, to put it mildly, less than fully credible.Exactly what happened remains unknown, and the gaps and ambiguities in the record provide the filmmakers with room for speculation and embellishment. (A recent article by Jenna Russell in The Boston Globe performs a sensitive and thorough fact-check.) In this version, Kopechne (played by Kate Mara) stays alive while trapped in the car, fighting for air as Kennedy (Jason Clarke) dawdles. Nothing beyond a close collegial friendship between them is implied. They were drawn together by shared grief over the death of Robert Kennedy, who had been assassinated the year before, and left a party together for a heart-to-heart talk.The test that “Chappaquiddick” sets for itself is not accuracy but plausibility. Whether or not events actually unfolded this way, the story the film tells is an interesting and complicated character study, with something to say about the corrosive effects of power and privilege on both the innocent and the guilty.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018At the center is Kennedy himself, whom Mr. Clarke plays as a decent, thoughtful man never quite comfortable in his own skin. That is partly because he has been denied possession of an independent identity. The last surviving Kennedy son, Ted lives in the shadow of his three dead brothers, Joseph, John and Robert. His weekend of sailing and party-going coincides with the Apollo 11 moon landing, a reminder of John Kennedy’s legacy and of Ted’s inadequacy.Before the accident, he shows himself to be a bit of a bumbler, steering his sailboat into a buoy during a regatta and freezing up during a television interview. He is more at ease with his friends Joe Gargan (Ed Helms) and Paul Markham (Jim Gaffigan), who will also be called upon for damage control when things go wrong. The question of Ted’s possible presidential candidacy hovers in the air, and comes up in his conversations with Mary Jo and her colleague Rachel Schiff (Olivia Thirlby).The film tries to make Mary Jo an equal participant in the story — more than just a victim or a mystery woman — and succeeds in individualizing her enough to underscore the horror of her death. What happens afterward is in some ways even more disturbing. Once the management of Ted’s case is turned over to his father’s inner circle, Mary Jo’s humanity is quietly but decisively erased. She is treated as a problem rather than a person.The villains in “Chappaquiddick” are Robert McNamara (Clancy Brown); Ted Sorensen (Taylor Nichols); and Ted Kennedy’s father, Joe (Bruce Dern), a fearsome patriarch even though he has been paralyzed by a stroke. He humiliates his son and turns matters over to a squad of fixers in suits who manipulate the local authorities and the news media to protect Ted’s political viability and the family’s power. Which is not to say that the movie lets Ted Kennedy off the hook. Its portrayal of his weakness — his cowardice, his self-pity, his lethal indecisiveness — is devastating. It offers a partial explanation for these failures without excusing them, and also without denying some of his better qualities.When Ted first calls his father, the old man has one word for him: “alibi.” For a time, “Chappaquiddick” explores an alternative meaning, the possibility that Ted, rather than saving his career and reputation, will take advantage of disgrace and free himself from a role he never really wanted. His guilt would excuse him from the burdens of family expectation.What happened was more complicated, and Mr. Curran and Mr. Clarke honor that complexity. Ted Kennedy never became president, but the people of Massachusetts re-elected him to the Senate seven more times. His political career was longer and arguably more consequential than those of his brothers. That isn’t to say he redeemed himself, or that anything he accomplished diminishes the awfulness of Mary Jo Kopechne’s death. Redemption and damnation are the stuff of mythology. This is just a sad piece of history."

The tools of his trade include a roll of duct tape and a ball-peen hammer smeared with blood, which might lead us to believe that we have entered the world of a serial killer. The girl whose picture is briefly glimpsed might be his latest victim. An aura of dread and violence is summoned by the off-center images, the syncopations of the editing and the relentless hum and throb of Jonny Greenwood’s score.Before long we understand that Joe is a rescuer and avenger rather than a predator: a survivor of war and child abuse who now specializes in delivering young women from evil. That Joe is officially a good guy isn’t much comfort, either to him or to the audience, who will spend the 90 minutes of Lynne Ramsay’s “You Were Never Really Here” in his fractured, anxious and desperately sad reality.Played by a burly, bearded, brooding Joaquin Phoenix, Joe is a man haunted by grief and tormented (but also comforted) by thoughts of suicide. He is capable of gentleness — with his fragile, half-senile mother (Judith Roberts) and with Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), a girl he tries to save from sex traffickers — and also of ferocious cruelty, directed at himself and his targets. “I hear you can be brutal,” a potential client says. By the time that line is uttered, we know that it’s a drastic understatement.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 26, 2018The movie, based on a nasty, 90-page novella by Jonathan Ames, is brutal, too, less in its graphic violence — though there is plenty of that — than in the grisly intensity of its mood. The plot, which involves an all-the-way-to-the-top kidnapping conspiracy catering to the depravities of powerful men, is lurid and preposterous, an episode of “Law and Order SVU” amplified with self-conscious “Taxi Driver” overtones. A different version of the story would have brought out the weary sentimentality of Mr. Ames’s book, and turned its pulpy genre poses into sub-superhero clichés. But Ms. Ramsay, an uncompromising and iconoclastic British filmmaker whose earlier features include “Ratcatcher,” “Morvern Callar” and “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” has never had much use for plot.Or rather, she uses conventional narrative elements as scaffolding for the emotional effects and psychological explorations that are her primary interests. “You Were Never Really Here” is less concerned with what Joe does or why he does it than with how it feels to be in his skin and in his head.Mr. Phoenix serves Ms. Ramsay’s vision with disciplined doggedness. His lines would probably fit on an index card, and none of them are especially memorable. But the sound of his breathing, his groans of frustration and his gasps of panic, his occasional squalls of weeping are hard to forget. Even if his adventures in a netherworld of abuse are not especially credible — or even if they are, to some extent, the product of his own disordered mind — there is something powerful in his agony.The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix’s performance and Ms. Ramsay’s direction are impressive, but it’s hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye. The title gestures toward emptiness and absence, of course, but what “You Were Never Really Here” delivers is less the promised dose of existential alienation than a thematic void. Joe is very much there: it’s everything else that seems to be missing."

This highly experimental feature from the director Dane Komljen, born in 1986 in the former Yugoslavia, does not present a conventional narrative or characters, or even images and sounds that always have obvious connections. (That’s clear from the start: We hear lapping waves during the opening credits, only for Mr. Komljen to cut to a still photograph of a movie theater interior, instead of the expected body of water.)The movie quotes Simone Weil and Jean-Luc Godard. All dialogue is in voice-over. The shards of a story initially focus on two men living on a decaying compound — according to a filmmaker’s note, an abandoned hotel complex on the outskirts of Montenegro. They never speak, but they are, at first, alone, camping in a space partly overtaken by nature. They doze together, scavenge the grounds and urinate outdoors.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnApril 2, 2018CreditCreditDart FilmOne recurring thread in “All the Cities of the North” concerns how people use and recycle buildings, appropriating spaces in ways for which they were not intended. The flurries of narration allude to socialistic objectives in architecture, whether in a Yugoslav company’s construction work for the International Trade Fair in Lagos, Nigeria, or the plans for the 20th-century city of Brasília.It can be tough to say whether the movie is productively or arbitrarily baffling, but it is never boring, and it achieves a balance between natural flow and purposefulness that suits its subject matter."

The moral of “Acrimony” seems to be: Leave a bad man, especially one who cheated on you before marriage and leeches off your financial resources — unless he has poured his life into the dream of inventing a self-recharging battery, in which case the bonds of matrimony are sacrosanct and no sacrifice is too great.In those circumstances, who could disagree? The movie opens with a judge ordering Melinda (Taraji P. Henson), who has skirted a restraining order, to undergo counseling. As the camera slowly moves in on Ms. Henson on the couch, Melinda tells us about the man who ruined her life.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018We learn how in college (when she’s played by Ajiona Alexus), Melinda met Robert (Antonio Madison, and later Lyriq Bent), a handsome chemical-engineering student who seduced her to the strains of Nina Simone. But Robert is no Prince Charming. After catching him with another woman, Melinda rams her car into his mobile home, knocking it over — an accident that also injures her and results in a hysterectomy.The film is just getting started. Melinda marries Robert anyway, and he continues to drain the money she inherited from her mother. Mr. Perry tracks the major expenses in onscreen text, and puts synonyms for the movie’s principal themes (“acrimony,” of course, as well as “deranged” and “inexorable”) in title cards.A partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, Melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn’t see. That’s just one of several ways in which Mr. Perry’s screenplay feels structurally shaky. Already ungainly in its mix of social realism and parable — Melinda undergoes a series of overwrought, essentially biblical trials in a city vaguely identified as present-day Pittsburgh — “Acrimony” truly gets muddled once it starts making excuses for its excuse-making antagonist.After all, what if Robert really means well? What if this time will be different? In addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses Stockholm syndrome’d in bad marriages, “Acrimony” also offers poor economic advice (Melinda’s enduring devotion to Robert is an illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy — except that the movie suggests she hasn’t sunk enough). And the less said about the yacht-based climax, featuring some of the least convincing ship-jumping ever filmed, the better.Ms. Henson does what she can with a role that keeps her anger at a low simmer until requiring her to go full banshee within basically one scene. You can’t accuse her or “Acrimony” of being boring, but the film falls short of a design for living."

You’ve done it! You not only did it once, you’ve done it twice. How many productions have you done?”Perhaps one reason Mr. Pacino is so dogged in his explorations of the play is because it’s one that few others would think to cast him in. The lead male role, that of Herod, a king who promises the title character anything if she will dance for him, is a meaty one, to be sure. But even more than that of the title character, a royal daughter who is determined to kiss the mouth of John the Baptist even if that requires his decapitation, Herod as a character is a figure balanced on the knife edge of Camp. And if there’s one mode of art that contemporary directors do not associate with Mr. Pacino, it’s Camp. (At least with intentional Camp.)ImageJessica Chastain, in “Wilde Salomé.”CreditSalome ProductionsWhich is not to say that Mr. Pacino interprets the character in an entirely uncharacteristic fashion. And I don’t think that at any point in the documentary he even brings up Camp. But he does give Herod a fey, pansexually flirtatious side that one doesn’t normally associate with Mr. Pacino, who, in most performances, whether quiet or manic, is almost always masculine in a conventionally unambiguous way.How his approach to the character works is answered by “Salomé,” the film. In a feat of artistic derring-do, while Mr. Pacino was acting in a Los Angeles theater production of the play directed by Ms. Parsons, he was himself directing a film version of the play on a nearby movie-studio soundstage. Mr. Pacino’s documentary chronicles the feat; “Salomé” the movie shows the results of one of his efforts.Mr. Pacino’s interpretation of the character is not ineffectual, and it finds its match in a Salomé played by Jessica Chastain, appearing several years before she achieved screen stardom. Their exchanges, and the exchanges between Ms. Chastain’s Salomé and Kevin Anderson’s John the Baptist, are frequently shot in close-up. The concentration of the performers and the power of Wilde’s unusually baroque, even for him, language (he originally composed the play in French, as it happens) makes for some mesmerizing scenes. But whenever Mr. Pacino cuts away from these performers, a connection is severed. The viewer is made too privy to how, in this rendering, Mr. Pacino suspends the work uneasily between theater and cinema.VideoA preview of the films.Published OnMarch 20, 2018In the documentary, there’s a scene in which Mr. Pacino opens a newspaper and sees an ad for the theatrical production blaring “Pacino Is Back.” He is immediately put off. “You know, this is the problem,” he says. “This is the problem with my whole life.” The movie never addresses it quite so explicitly, but “Wilde Salomé” is most fascinating as a portrait of a superstar actor who, for all his wealth and privilege, encounters unusual frustrations as he pursues genuine artistic ambitions.By the same token, though, not a lot of documentarians out there have the name-recognition clout to attract Tom Stoppard, Gore Vidal, Tony Kushner and, yes, Ireland’s Artistic Ambassador to the World, Bono, to weigh in on Oscar Wilde for them.Mr. Pacino clashes with Ms. Parsons, with his movie producers and others. While much of the offstage drama has an authentic tartness, some of it feels manufactured, as in a scene at the movie’s end that depicts Mr. Pacino asserting his aforementioned clout to get something the viewer has been persuaded to believe he will be denied. He becomes his own King Herod in a sense. The weird power dynamics at play throughout are almost as fascinating as the play with which Mr. Pacino professes to be obsessed."

Instead, “Personal Problems” sits itself down at sidewalk cafes, in nightclub corners, at apartments where parties are celebrated and memorial gatherings attended. The setting is mostly Harlem, including Harlem Hospital where some of its characters work.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018“Personal Problems” contains not a single shot that can be called beautiful, but there’s also not a genuinely wrong-footed view in the whole work. It’s as if the camera is negotiating with reality, trying to find a place at the characters’ tables. The viewer gets a wide window into African-American life in New York at this time; it’s intimate to the point of awkwardness. The title derives from what Ms. Brown, who works as a nurse (and is brought to spectacular, unaffected life by Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, the groundbreaking culinary anthropologist and writer) says in an onscreen interview at the opening of the work. Reflecting on her place in the city relative to South Carolina, from where she came, and how she related to a patient who came in with a bullet wound who was also from that state, she goes on: “Of course everybody’s got their own personal problems so you go home, you got the problems of home … I’m tense, a lot of the time.” The tensions are such that anyone can understand them, but this work is also about how the added dimension of being black in America increases stress.This is hardly a humorless examination though. At a lunch, a group of women gossip snarkily; one recounts of a friend, “She said ‘I’m doing office work now,’ guess what, she means she was cleaning offices.” There’s a boisterous, querulous argument in the back room of a bar between characters played by Mr. Reed and Kip Hanrahan, the recording artist and musical impresario; Mr. Hanrahan’s white radical posture generates no small amusement. The movie shows the personal as political while never overtly insisting on the point.This is a work that looks as if it were evolving even as portions of it were completed. That’s entirely appropriate. For all its rough edges, “Personal Problems” retains a vitality and an integrity that practically bounds off the screen."

Others, though, are unlikely to fare much better, given that this unflinching debut feature from Russ Harbaugh delivers something rarely seen in American movies: a warts-and-all examination of extended grief.Arranged in discrete, scrapbook-like scenes, the narrative (loosely based on Mr. Harbaugh’s own family experiences) comes at mourning only obliquely. At the center is Suzanne (a remarkable Andie MacDowell), who watches her husband die, painfully and exhaustingly, at home, attended by their two sons, Nicholas (Chris O’Dowd) and Chris (James Adomian).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 22, 2018Those early scenes are harrowing enough, depicting the draining physical labor of caring for someone who’s terminally ill. What comes after, though, is more subtly distressing as pain manifests, not in weepy conversations, but in behavior that — at least as far as the sons are concerned — seems an exaggeration of tendencies already in place. So while Suzanne drifts uneasily into new relationships, Nicholas swaps partners and Chris dives into a bottle.On paper, this doesn’t sound like much. But Mr. Harbaugh and his cast (all of whom shine, but Mr. O’Dowd is revelatory) have created a wary, chilly drama that refuses to shy away from ugliness — or from Nicholas and Suzanne’s sometimes uncomfortably jagged intimacy. Elegantly shot on film by Chris Teague, the movie feels unforced and at times shockingly authentic, allowing its emotions to percolate and rise of their own volition. In one dreamy, wordless scene, Suzanne wanders alone into a crowded dance party, her bewilderment that of a woman who’s no longer sure of her place — either in that room, or in the world."

His small section of rural Washington has barely changed; whether he can still fit into it is another question.Freedom, and its negotiation, is Ms. Shelton’s subject this time out (she and Mr. Duplass wrote the story together), and the parole officer’s admonition could apply to any one of the characters with whom Chris interacts. Chief among these is Carol (Edie Falco), Chris’s former high-school teacher and the prime instrument of his early release. Unhappily married to a cold man who disdains her volunteer work with prison inmates, Carol is unprepared for Chris’s romantic expectations. Immature and inexperienced, Chris can’t quite grasp that the feelings he nurtured while inside might not be shared.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 22, 2018CreditCreditNathan M. Miller/The OrchardExploring big questions through small, intimate moments, “Outside In” is a love story that prioritizes patience and pragmatism over passion. Slowly, Carol is noticing the bars of her own prison, the stultifying stasis of her life and the emotional desert of her marriage. That vacuum has alienated her teenage daughter, Hildy (a marvelous Kaitlyn Dever), who escapes by making fantastical art in an abandoned house. Seeing it, Chris recognizes a lonely kindred spirit, and a friendship begins — one that Carol is not entirely comfortable with.In a movie whose greatest tension comes from wondering whether Chris will violate his parole by drinking a beer, the actors need to be compelling. Easily clearing that bar, Ms. Falco gives Carol a gentle kindness and the emotional intelligence to transform Chris’s ardor into a catalyst. And anyone who’s been watching the Amazon series “Transparent” knows that Mr. Duplass has a knack for playing fragile, wounded masculinity. He understands how to make a weapon out of guilelessness, and he uses it to make Chris so disarmingly bashful it’s easy to miss how unreliable he might be.Shot in warm pastel tones and drizzly, mouse-colored light, “Outside In” is, like its characters, a little washed-out. It’s also less comedic in tone than most of Ms. Shelton’s previous features, the slow, straightforward style making it appear uneventful. Yet even if Chris and Carol’s most exciting encounter spends more time in a bowling alley than a bedroom, their steadily shifting affection seems a small miracle of resilience and hope."

A city partly made by the movies and defined by them, too, Los Angeles rarely comes off like a lived reality onscreen. It’s a hazy dream, a gaudy fantasy, a noirish nightmare, an Instagramble cliché. It’s no wonder moviegoers and other virtual tourists can map it in their heads without visiting it, even if the Los Angeles they probably know is little more than an aerial view of the Hollywood sign, a cutaway to a clogged freeway and a slavering look at a bountiful blonde.Every so often, a filmmaker plays with these banalities, which I imagine is why Aaron Katz opens “Gemini,” a pleasurably drifty, low-wattage mystery set in Los Angeles, with an upside-down shot of a palm tree. Perfectly framed and photographed, its feathery fronds spreading in silhouette against a dark-indigo night sky, the tree hangs in the shot like a chandelier. Mr. Katz gives “Gemini” the expected smoggy freeways and a blonde on a billboard, as well as the kind of mystery that certain Hollywood dreams are made of, complete with a femme fatale, a detective and a lonely horn on the soundtrack. But as that upside-down palm tree suggests, he is coming at Los Angeles from his own angle.Like a lot of intrigues, this one opens at night. Jill (an appealing Lola Kirke), a personal assistant, is sitting behind the wheel of a parked car, her face lighted by a cellphone. It’s a decidedly ordinary scene, even if cinephiles might flash on a different woman staring into a glowing box in the explosive 1955 noir “Kiss Me Deadly.” As she often is, Jill is waiting for Heather (Zoë Kravitz), a young star going through some kind of undefined rough patch. Heather has a meeting with a filmmaker, Greg (an amusingly acid Nelson Franklin), one of those jaundiced, permanently disappointed industry types who doubtless read Nathanael West’s “The Day of the Locust” at too tender an age.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018“You’re going to kill me,” Heather tells Jill, using a variation on a murderous sentiment that’s tossed around a lot at the start of “Gemini.” Heather has decided that she doesn’t want to do Greg’s movie, a long-gestating project, and she wants Jill to break the bad news to him. Jill does. He does not take it well. Neither does Heather’s agent, who, perhaps jokingly, though also with a hint of genuine malice, says that she wants to kill Heather, without whom there’s no movie. If Heather feels guilty about letting everyone down, she doesn’t show it, and before long she and Jill are driving into the jeweled night.The very next day, the cops are putting a toe tag on Heather, and Jill is a person of interest and soon on the run, having fled a detective (John Cho) who’s more suavely cinematic than professionally adept. She gives herself a quick, amusing makeover, slipping on a trench coat and dyeing her hair blond, a tint that evokes Barbara Stanwyck’s viperous vamp in “Double Indemnity.” The trench at least fits Jill, a rather ordinary, opaque Nancy Drew. She enters a thickening mystery and meets a few suspects — the fine cast includes Greta Lee, James Ransone and Michelle Forbes — but Jill doesn’t so much chase down clues as stumble on those Mr. Katz has scattered.Mr. Katz, who also wrote and edited “Gemini,” is having a good time playing around with genre, as when the camera lingers on a black bird right out of “The Maltese Falcon.” But he isn’t much concerned with the techniques of the whodunit and “the simple art of murder,” to quote a memorable phrase from Raymond Chandler. The murder here isn’t interesting or especially mysterious (intentionally, it seems), and Jill’s sleuthing is often plain silly. What really interests Mr. Katz here are movies — the fingerprints of directors like Robert Altman, David Lynch, Michael Mann and Sean Baker are all on “Gemini” — and how they have shaped Los Angeles, or at least our ideas about it.In his documentary “Los Angeles Plays Itself,” the filmmaker Thom Andersen observes that the city is hard to get right: “It’s elusive, just beyond the reach of an image.” It’s the neon blur out a car window, a sun-baked backdrop. Mr. Katz knows that dream city, and early on, when Jill and Heather drive through the night, the camera looks onto a gaudy slipstream. Mr. Katz understands that that blur is seductive. But there is always more — even in Los Angeles — and so, as his desultory mystery unfolds, he turns his attention elsewhere. He lingers on beauty and catches the light at dusk, searching and sometimes finding an elusive city that has always been there for those who bother to look."

The result is a dazzling series of separate outdoor scenes that open onto one another, with each framing a view of the next, or the St. Lawrence River beyond.

Although Mr. Cabot says he planned his plantings with the “joy of discovery” and the emotional impact in mind, overall “The Gardener” is flat and lacking in soul, a word that comes up many times in the movie.

Like a former soldier, this middle-aged man grapples with survivor’s guilt, and with the sort of emptiness of a battlefield after the war ends.Such a character could, in some hands, come off as inert as he chain-smokes and dwells on his memories. Yet he’s vividly played here by Alan Cumming, who uses a minimalist palette to paint a complex personality. It’s a masterly, controlled performance, in which a glance or a change in voice tone colors an entire scene.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 21, 2018The production isn’t always as skilled. Vincent Gagliostro, directing his first feature, frames most every shot like the one before it, and his script, written with Anthony Johnston, heavily underlines the characters’ contrasts. After meeting Braeden (Zachary Booth), that attractive 20-something, Sam voices his resentment of the new generation of gay men, who take so much for granted. It’s a complicated kind of anger, yet one that could be better explored through subtext rather than speeches.Still, those are marginal criticisms of a film that feels authentic when portraying those who survived the worst years of the AIDS epidemic (it’s not surprising to learn that Mr. Gagliostro was an early member of Act Up) and when conveying the bittersweet passing of time in anyone’s life, gay or straight. Some stronger filmmaking would be welcome, sure, but “After Louie” has an honesty that’s often just as valuable."

Senna and Adam speak to each other as if they were reading from greeting cards, and the turning points in their relationship are served like reheated romantic comedy leftovers. Even when the script doesn’t trip over gumball wedding rings and tone-deaf karaoke scenes, the direction drains the story of specificity and feeling. The costume design is especially egregious, as Senna’s style as a designer seems culled straight from fast fashion stores at outlet malls. Both sartorially and cinematically, the seasoned star at the heart of “All I Wish” deserves a movie with more to offer than knockoff style."

To make it look as if Vic is conversing with his younger self, Mr. Rifkin edits in footage of Mr. Reynolds from “Smokey and the Bandit” and “Deliverance.” It’s a decent idea, but the matching is poor and the clips appear arbitrary."

But in the case of “The China Hustle,” a documentary may simply be the wrong delivery mechanism for a byzantine exposé that cries out for detailed news reporting.With a rapidly paced barrage of talking heads and TV clips, the director Jed Rothstein makes his case: After the financial crisis, investors turned to Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. But skeptics say those assets show signs of being overvalued.In one of the best sequences, Dan David, a founder of GeoInvesting, which investigates U.S.-listed Chinese companies, explains how — using calculations and surveillance that the film describes as illegal in China — he determined that a fertilizer company could not be producing as much as it claimed. If or when these stocks crash en masse, the movie argues, the result, like the burst of the housing bubble, will hit Americans’ pension funds.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018Mr. David has turned to short-selling these stocks, that is, betting that they will fail. (It’s perhaps noteworthy that one of the executive producers, Mark Cuban, has not been shy about engaging in that practice in the past.)“The China Hustle” also features interviews with Alexandra Stevenson of The New York Times and the retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the former presidential candidate who served as chairman of the investment bank Rodman & Renshaw. He is criticized by others in the movie for his tenure there. “I don’t think I want to be in the film,” he says before walking off camera, but the sequence is too heavily edited to seem fair."

Even before its release, this adaptation of Ernest Cline’s 2011 best seller — what one writer called a  “nerdgasm” of a novel — was subjected to an unusual degree of internet pre-hate. That was only to be expected. Mr. Spielberg has tackled contentious topics before — terrorism, slavery, the Pentagon Papers, sharks — but nothing as likely to stir up a hornet’s nest of defensiveness, disdain and indignant “actually”-ing as the subject of this movie, which is video games.And not only video games. “Ready Player One,” written by Mr. Cline and Zak Penn, dives into the magma of fan zeal, male self-pity and techno-mythology in which those once-innocent pastimes are now embedded. Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood.Aided by his usual cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, and by the production designer Adam Stockhausen, he turns a vast virtual landscape of battling avatars into a bustling pop-cultural theme park, an interactive museum of late-20th- and early-21st-century entertainment, a maze of niche tastes, cultish preoccupations and blockbuster callbacks. Mr. Spielberg navigates this warehouse with his usual dexterity, loading every frame with information without losing the clarity and momentum of the story.Nonetheless, the toy guns of social media and pop-up kulturkritik are locked and loaded. Mr. Spielberg will be accused of taking games and their players too seriously and not seriously enough, of pandering and mocking, of just not getting it and not being able to see beyond it — “it” being the voracious protoplasm that has, over the past three or four decades, swallowed up most of our cultural discourse. Whatever you call it — the revenge of the nerds, the franchising of the universe, the collapse of civilization — it’s a force that is at once emancipatory and authoritarian, innocent and pathological, delightful and corrosive.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018Mr. Spielberg and some of his friends helped to create this monster, which grants him a measure of credibility and also opens him up to a degree of suspicion. He is the only person who could have made this movie and the last person who should have been allowed near the material.That material has issues of its own. Mr. Cline’s book — readable and amusing without being exactly good — is a hodgepodge of cleverness and cliché. Less than a decade after publication, it already feels a bit dated, partly because its dystopian vision seems unduly optimistic and partly because its vision of male geek rebellion has turned stale and sour.In the film, set in 2045, Wade Watts (a young man played by the agreeably bland, blandly agreeable Tye Sheridan) lives in “the stacks,” a vertical pile of trailers where the poorer residents of Columbus, Ohio (Oklahoma City in the book), cling to hope, dignity and their VR gloves. Humanity has been ravaged by the usual political and ecological disasters (among them “bandwidth riots” referred to in Wade’s introductory voice-over), and most people seek refuge in a digital paradise called the Oasis.That world — less a game than a Jorge Luis Borges cosmos populated by wizards, robots and racecar drivers — is the creation of James Halliday (Mark Rylance). After Halliday’s death, his avatar revealed the existence of a series of Easter eggs, or secret digital treasures, the discovery of which would win a lucky player control of the Oasis. Wade is a “gunter” — short for “egg hunter” — determined to pursue this quest even after most of the other gamers have tired of it. Among his rivals are a few fellow believers and Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the head of a company called IOI that wants to bring Halliday’s paradise under corporate control.In the real world, IOI encourages Oasis fans to run up debts that it collects by forcing them into indentured servitude. Sorrento’s villainy sets up a battle on two fronts — clashes in the Oasis mirroring chases through the streets of Columbus — that inspires Mr. Spielberg to feats of crosscutting virtuosity. The action is so swift and engaging that some possibly literal-minded questions may be brushed aside. I, for one, didn’t quite understand why, given the global reach of the Oasis, all the relevant players were so conveniently clustered in Ohio. (If anyone wants to explain, please find me on Twitter so I can mute you.)‘Ready Player One’ Is a Vintage Pop BonanzaHere’s a rundown of some of the bigger references you need to know before watching Steven Spielberg’s film.March 29, 2018But, of course, Columbus and the Oasis do not represent actual or virtual realities, but rather two different modalities of fantasy. Wade’s avatar, Parzival, collects a posse of fighters: Sho, Daito, Aech and Art3mis, who is also his love interest. When the people attached to these identities meet up in Columbus, they are not exactly as they are in the game. Aech, large and male in the Oasis, is played by Lena Waithe. But the fluidity of online identity remains an underexploited possibility. In and out of the Oasis, Art3mis (also known as Samantha, and portrayed by Olivia Cooke) is a male fantasy of female badassery. Sho (Philip Zhao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) are relegated to sidekick duty. The multiplayer, self-inventing ethos of gaming might have offered a chance for a less conventional division of heroic labor, but the writers and filmmakers lacked the imagination to take advantage of it.The most fun part of “Ready Player One” is its exuberant and generous handing out of pop-cultural goodies. Tribute is paid to Mr. Spielberg’s departed colleagues John Hughes and Stanley Kubrick. The visual and musical allusions are eclectic enough that nobody is likely to feel left out, and everybody is likely to feel a little lost from time to time.Nostalgia? Sure, but what really animates the movie is a sense of history. The Easter egg hunt takes Parzival and his crew back into Halliday’s biography — his ill-starred partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), his thwarted attempts at romance — and also through the evolution of video games and related pursuits. The history is instructive and also sentimental in familiar ways, positing a struggle for control between idealistic, artistic entrepreneurs (and their legions of fans) and soulless corporate greedheads.Halliday is a sweet, shaggy nerd with a guileless Northern California drawl and a deeply awkward manner, especially around women. Sorrento is an autocratic bean counter, a would-be master of the universe who doesn’t even like video games. These characters are clichés, but they are also allegorical figures.In the movie, they represent opposing principles, but in our world, they are pretty much the same guy. A lot of the starry-eyed do-it-yourselfers tinkering in their garages and giving life to their boyish dreams back in the ’70s and ’80s turned out to be harboring superman fantasies of global domination all along. They shared their wondrous creations and played the rest of us for suckers, collecting our admiration, our attention and our data as profit and feudal tribute.Mr. Spielberg incarnates this duality as perfectly as any man alive. He is the peer of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and a Gandalf for the elves and hobbits who made Google, Facebook and the other components of our present-day Oasis. He has been man-child and mogul, wide-eyed artist and cold-eyed businessman, praised for making so many wonderful things and blamed for ruining everything. His career has been a splendid enactment of the cultural contradictions of capitalism, and at the same time a series of deeply personal meditations on love, loss and imagination. All of that is also true of Halliday’s Oasis. “Ready Player One” is far from a masterpiece, but as the fanboys say, it’s canon."

It’s anarchic and rigorous, sophisticated and goofy, heartfelt and cynical. The score, by Ennio Morricone, is as mellow as wine. The action is raw, nasty and blood-soaked. The story is preposterous, the politics sincere.In 2018, it’s possible — and perhaps inevitable — to view “The Great Silence” as a footnote to the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino, whose admiration for Corbucci is well documented. Corbucci’s 1966 western “Django” was an inspiration for Mr. Tarantino’s “Django Unchained,” and “The Hateful Eight” shares a snowbound aesthetic and a gleeful commitment to cruelty with “The Great Silence.” The scholarly minded viewer can trace other connections and divergences as well — to classic American westerns and to the contemporaneous and better-known work of the spaghetti maestro Sergio Leone.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 20, 2018But this plate of pasta — bitter and pungent, nourishing and perhaps a bit nauseating — should be savored on its own. It takes place at the end of the 19th century in “Snow Hill, Utah,” a place name that sounds infinitely more exotic in Italian. There, farmers have been driven off their land and forced into banditry, leaving them at the mercy of bounty killers, the most fearsome and sadistic of whom is played by Klaus Kinski.His character — referred to as Tigrero aloud and Loco in the subtitles — is a whispering sociopath and a symbol of the Darwinian brutality that governs Snow Hill. The actual governor wants to bring the area under the rule of law, and dispatches a bumbling, decent sheriff (Frank Wolff) to bring Tigrero and the rest of the bounty killers into line. The lawman’s earnest efforts are a sideshow to the main drama, though, which pits Tigrero and his minions against a solitary avenger known as Silenzio.Played by the great Jean-Louis Trintignant, Silenzio is a tragic, poetic variation on Clint Eastwood’s taciturn Man With No Name. Silenzio is not a man of few words, but a survivor of horrific violence. When he was a child, the bounty hunters who murdered his parents severed his vocal cords to keep him from talking. He has grown up into Tigrero’s double and opposite, meting out justice for money and following a strict code of ethics. He will never draw his gun first, but he will always shoot faster than his adversary.Silenzio’s services are solicited by Pauline (Vonetta McGee), the widow of one of Tigrero’s victims. The fact that she and her husband are black is at once a casual detail and a sign of the film’s anti-authoritarian, democratic ideology. The couple seems to have been welcomed by the other good people of Snow Hill, but their race is a big issue for the bad guys.The plot takes a twist or two, but serves mainly as a thread linking shootouts and glowering confrontations, with a brief respite for love. The mood is sometimes jaunty, but “The Great Silence” is no joke, and the fatalism of its ending serves as an implicit critique of the sentimental optimism of many Hollywood westerns. Power speaks louder than silence."

This tour of high school heartbreak follows Katie (Bella Thorne), a wide-eyed teenager who has xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition that renders her dangerously sensitive to ultraviolet light. Although xeroderma pigmentosum is actually a disease, “Midnight Sun” forgoes realism, exaggerating the risks of Katie’s illness to portray even the slightest exposure to sunlight as a cause of fatal neurodegeneration.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 14, 2018Because of her condition, Katie is isolated from her peers, spending most of her time with her adoring father (Rob Riggle), who tries to keep his daughter’s confinement cozy. Though neither Katie nor “Midnight Sun” seems disturbed by the paternalism of her circumstances, most fairy tales revolve around a prince, not a parent, and, accordingly, both Katie and the film idealize romance.So, from the safety of her ultraviolet-light-resistant bedroom window, Katie daydreams about puppy love as if she were a princess in a tower. Every day, she waits for the same boy, Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold), to roll by on his skateboard. When this saint of the Seattle suburbs stumbles upon Katie busking near the local train station one evening, he falls in love at first sight. They begin to see each other only at night, and Katie conceals her illness, despite her father’s warnings. Like the sun, the potential for disaster inevitably rises.Under the limp direction of Scott Speer, “Midnight Sun” suffocates its sentimental script, portraying passion without wonder, sacrifice without ecstasy. Charlie professes his devotion with a plastered smile and dead eyes. Katie writes love songs that are forgotten the moment she stops singing. Lacking both the romantic chemistry and the directorial panache that might justify its life-or-death stakes, “Midnight Sun” is a medical melodrama in need of resuscitation."

He frequently makes films about a character named Paul Dedalus — a nod to the young hero of Joyce’s “Ulysses.” And Mr. Desplechin’s characters sometimes soliloquize with words adapted from Philip Roth’s novels. This latest film, “Ismael’s Ghosts,” adds Henri Bloom, an aging filmmaker, to Mr. Desplechin’s oeuvre, and his name, of course, evokes the older protagonist in Joyce’s novel.For all that, Mr. Desplechin’s films cannot, or ought not, be considered literary. Cinema is the only medium that can accommodate the narrative sprawl that has distinguished this director’s work since even before “My Sex Life … or How I Got Into an Argument” (1996), a film in which he originated several characters who incarnate in his later works.“Ismael’s Ghosts” opens with a film-within-a-film, an espionage thriller about one Ivan Dedalus, a globe-trotting diplomat turned spy. (He’s probably related to Paul, but you don’t have to understand this convoluted situation to enjoy the movie.) Ivan springs from the mind of Ismael Vuillard (Mathieu Amalric), whose reverie is interrupted by a 3 a.m. phone call from his former father-in-law, Henri Bloom (Laszlo Szabo). Both men are still mourning the loss of Carlotta (hello, “Vertigo” people), Bloom’s daughter and Ismael’s wife, who disappeared 20 years ago. Ismael is now involved with Sylvia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), an astrophysicist, who, shortly after her introduction becomes the movie’s temporary narrator, and takes the story back a couple of years. On return to the present, Ismael and Sylvia hole up in a beach house, and one afternoon while sunbathing, Sylvia is approached by a woman (Marion Cotillard) who introduces herself as Carlotta.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018If you think this messes things up, you are correct, and the complications drive Sylvia away from Ismael. This turmoil comes close to driving Ismael, and Bloom, mad. Further developments bring back Ivan (Louis Garrel) — both his fictional iteration as dreamed up by Ismael and his real-life manifestation as Ismael’s brother, who’s come to see the filmmaker as a family idiot of sorts.There’s a lot of rage in Mr. Desplechin’s characters, especially the male ones, and as felt and articulated in this film by both Ismael and Bloom, rage is both terrifying and absurdly funny. (In this, Mr. Desplechin finds a close affinity with Mr. Roth, particularly the author’s 1995 novel, “Sabbath’s Theater.”) Mr. Amalric, who’s been a major player for Mr. Desplechin since the 1990s, is always adept at balancing on the knife-edge of hysteria and hilarity. Mr. Szabo is more magisterial, but also conveys the way that heroic men can be ridiculous.Ms. Gainsbourg’s Sylvia is a voice of reason, demonstrating that tantalizing sensuality and grounded serenity needn’t be mutually exclusive. But she’s no pushover. As for Carlotta, Ms. Cotillard sometimes plays her with confounding, slow-motion swagger. The actress also has instantaneous access to the character’s affecting vulnerability. Carlotta initially seems like a negative force, but she proves to be an object lesson about life’s curveballs and our tendency to overreact to them. As for Mr. Garrel, his exasperation as the “real” Ivan makes him the film’s most droll presence.As is customary in Mr. Desplechin’s work, there’s a lot of dialogue in “Ismael’s Ghosts,” but this movie’s nerve endings vibrate most avidly and tenderly in scenes where not a word is spoken: Sylvia on her first ride home with Ismael, looking up in serene rapture from a cab window toward the night sky; Ismael, angry and confused, framed between walls at the top of a dark staircase; Carlotta in tears, letting the blast of water from an ornamental shower head blast against her brow. It’s moments like these that make “Ismael’s Ghosts” an unforgettable experience."

Raped by the police after a university party, Mariam, accompanied by a young man she has just met (Ghanem Zrelli), desperately seeks help, first from an indifferent private clinic and then a chaotic public hospital.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018“She looks fine,” a bored admitting clerk remarks, noting Mariam’s lack of visible bruises and staring pointedly at her skimpy dress. Uncaring at best and contemptuous at worst, the hospital workers refuse to examine her without her I.D. card (lost during the rape) and a special certificate — which she’ll have to request from the very police station where her attackers work.Inspired by a true story, Ms. Ben Hania leans hard and heavy on official corruption, oppressive morality codes and a Tunisian bureaucracy dominated by male power. Contrasting the cold sterility of her locations with a fiery emotional urgency, she pushes her increasingly distraught heroine from vulnerability to defiance, from a whimper to a roar.The result is an unapologetically feminist and furiously single-minded movie that might have benefited from more nuanced characterizations. (The police, in particular, can seem almost cartoonishly callous and leering.) Yet the filmmaking is so striking — and Ms. Al Ferjani so movingly, indefatigably resolute — it’s impossible not to persevere right along with her."

Only this isn’t the lavender-scented idyll of Provence or the gleaming luxury of the Riviera; the setting is La Ciotat, a port town that has gone from its midcentury glory days of building ships to its current slot in the global economy, servicing yachts. The students are a diverse bunch of working-class locals; the teacher, Olivia, is a famous novelist, brought in from elsewhere to help them write a book together that has to take place in the town.The class differences between teacher and students are so pronounced that they threaten to plunge the film into a schoolhouse drama — that well-worn genre in which a charismatic authority figure, inevitably likable yet inevitably tough, gains her students’ grudging respect and eventual trust. (Mr. Cantet also directed “The Class,” a moving yet unsentimental film about a teacher and his young charges in one of Paris’s poorer arrondissements.)But Marina Foïs’s performance as Olivia pulls off a delicate balancing act. Even as Olivia emerges as a complicated character — an accomplished novelist with sympathy for her students as well as a surprisingly perverse imagination — she never quite sheds her remote cosmopolitan sheen.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018Olivia’s good intentions keep running aground with Antoine, the workshop’s gadfly and troll, played with taut intensity by Matthieu Lucci, in a bracing debut. While the other students propose a thriller based on La Ciotat’s proud shipbuilding past, Antoine repeatedly goads them with his casual racism and violent fantasies.We see a lot of Antoine — in class, at home, goofing around with his friends, swimming in the cove — but the smart, canny screenplay by Mr. Cantet and Robin Campillo takes care not to make him more explicable to us than he is to himself. In the workshop, Antoine gives a resolute performance as a disaffected young man; in the rest of his life, he seems to be drifting. More than caustic anger, he emanates uncertainty and confusion.Antoine watches online clips by a far-right propagandist who rages against globalization and “E.U. bureaucrats,” but his interest verges on desultory; the clips are just another thing to look at after he does a few situps or inspects his physique in the mirror. More enthralling for him are video games, which Antoine plays with what looks to be genuine engagement and actual joy.Pierre Milon’s lush cinematography captures the warmth of the Mediterranean light, but it’s the first shot of the film — footage from a video game of a knight-errant, wandering a mountainous landscape in search of what to do next — that sets us up for the contemporary fable that’s in store.At one point, Olivia tries to mine Antoine’s experiences to help her understand a character that she’s having a hard time writing about in her own book. It’s a measure of this film’s stealthy brilliance that it blurs the line between empathy and exploitation. The real story, it turns out, won’t be hers to tell."

When we meet her, she’s setting ingeniously intricate traps with a jam-like bait containing glitter and gummy bears.

Capturing beach and woodland in wide, scenic sweeps, the director of photography, Rasmus Heise, balances the film’s thick and volatile emotions with a welcome airiness. Outside, stalking monsters, is where Barbara lives and breathes.Pondering grief and denial, lost dreams and irrevocably altered futures, Mr. Walter proves you don’t need a giant-sized special-effects budget to conjure enchantment and danger.“People close to me get hurt,” Barbara tells her sole friend.

"4479","Isle of Dogs","PG-13",1,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: Wes Anderson’s Bleakly Beautiful ‘Isle of Dogs’","Set in a fantasy Japan, Mr. Anderson’s new movie tells a heroic story of abandoned dogs, voiced by Bill Murray, Liev Schreiber and others.","2018-03-22","2018-03-23","2018-04-22 16:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/movies/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson.html,Read the New York Times Review of Isle of Dogs,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/23/arts/23isleofdogs4/23isleofdogs4-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"A miniaturist who likes to max out, Wes Anderson creates elaborate counter worlds that look like ours while remaining uniquely Andersonian. Together they comprise a kind of Wes World, in which reality seems as if it has been filtered through a sieve and then carefully arranged with white gloves in a vitrine. The results can be thrilling or wearying, and sometimes both, as is the case with his latest, “Isle of Dogs,” an animated movie set in a fantasy Japan. There, cat-fancying villains of the future conspire to eradicate dogs, prompting one character to plaintively ask, “Whatever happened to man’s best friend?”It’s an earnest, heart-heavy question in a movie, by turns droll and melancholic, that can be easier to admire than to flat-out love. As he did in “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” Mr. Anderson tells his tale primarily using stop-motion animation, an artisanal process that creates the illusion of movement frame by frame with objects like puppets. The story takes off in Megasaki City, where the thuggish Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura), has banished dogs to an island garbage dump, beginning with Spots (Liev Schreiber), a weaponized guardian of, and loving companion to, Atari (Koyu Rankin), the mayor’s 12-year-old ward.VideoWes Anderson narrates a sequence from the film.Published OnMarch 29, 2018CreditCreditFox Searchlight Pictures“Isle of Dogs” takes off as Atari searches for Spots, a heroic quest that leads him to a canine penal colony, a wasteland where mysteriously sick dogs fight over morsels gleaned from rancid, maggoty garbage. It’s a horror show — and an apt, brutal metaphor for our offscreen world — with an abandoned nuclear power plant and a derelict amusement park. This being a Wes Anderson production, it is also visually seductive, filled with perfectly aligned cubistic trash, gleaming pools of toxic liquid and walls of colored glass bottles that glow like stained-glass windows on a sun-drenched morning.Trash Island is ugly, but its horrors are attenuated by their meticulous construction and visual splendor, and quickly contained. Mr. Anderson soon brings in his lead dogs, scene-stealers of every breed whose barks are rendered in English. There are purebreds and mutts and a silky show dog, Nutmeg, voiced with husky insouciance by, naturally, Scarlett Johansson. The top dogs, though, are an alpha male pack, a quintet of skinny throwaways voiced by Edward Norton (Rex), Bill Murray (Boss), Jeff Goldblum (Duke), Bob Balaban (King) and Bryan Cranston, whose Chief, a proud, violent stray (“I bite”), has wisely never depended on the unreliable kindness of humans.The dogs provide the emotion in this movie. They’re surprising, touching and thoroughly delightful company distinguished by witty vocalizations, expressive eccentricities and too many heartbreaking markers of abuse — matted fur, open wounds, painfully knobby legs and that anxious, mournful look of devotion that dogs retain for even the most unworthy humans. (The head of the puppet department is Andy Gent, who worked on “Fantastic Mr. Fox.”) The dogs have been abandoned by their masters; damningly, only Atari has set off on a rescue mission. Yet most haven’t relinquished their connections to their peopled past. They yearn for a pat on the head.The story of the abused animals of Trash Island evokes tales of pain and suffering like “Black Beauty” and “Beautiful Joe.” Mr. Anderson, who also wrote the screenplay, handles this theme unpersuasively, nodding at genocide only to skitter away and return to his embroidered visuals. “Isle of Dogs” is filled with exquisite illustrations, whimsical flourishes and nostalgic details — old-fashioned labels, computer punch cards — that thicken the texture of its imaginary world. But too often the movie feels overworked, fussy. And when an explosion darkens Trash Island, evoking the horrors of Japan’s past, Mr. Anderson feels like he’s circling a profundity he doesn’t know how to handle.ImageAtari, center, whose search for his dog, Spots, becomes a heroic quest.CreditFox Searchlight/20th Century FoxLike many of Mr. Anderson’s movies, “Isle of Dogs” is very much about storytelling — it’s narrated by Courtney B. Vance — which means that it’s about the past as much as the present or future. It opens with a fable about a boy samurai, a precursor to Atari and one of Mr. Anderson’s wise youngsters. We spend a lot of time with Atari, so it’s too bad that much of what he says is not translated into English. There are some cute interpretive moves (a translator voiced by Frances McDormand), but Mr. Anderson clearly didn’t want subtitles competing with his visuals. So when the Japanese characters speak, their words are usually reduced to the decorative, at least for non-Japanese speakers.It’s a strange, discomfiting choice not least because it means that few of the Japanese characters, including Atari, have the depth or dignity given the dogs. Back in Megasaki City, when the mayor plots and scientists (Akira Ito and the one and only Yoko Ono) work on a cure for what ails the dogs, only some of what they say is conveyed. At the same time, high school journalists, led by a foreign-exchange student, Tracy (Greta Gerwig), investigate the mayor. Tracy speaks Japanese but mostly yammers on in English. A bossy boots with a blond puffball of hair, she is a tedious variation on Tracy Flick (of “Election”) and Mr. Anderson’s own young strivers (“Rushmore” and elsewhere).Mr. Anderson has always drawn liberally from film history, folding allusions to favorites into his work. In “Isle of Dogs,” he gives an apparent shout-out to the director Seijun Suzuki. The mayor was amusingly (and convincingly) modeled on the actor Toshiro Mifune, known for his work with Akira Kurosawa, whom Mr. Anderson has referenced, with Hayao Miyazaki, as an influence on “Isle of Dogs.” The allusions are loving, but at times also ritualistic, distracting and uninvolving; mostly Mr. Anderson is replaying his own greatest hits, going back to familiar ideas — the fallen adult world included — that would work better if they weren’t smothered in filigree and self-consciousness.And yet, time and again, Mr. Anderson pulls you hard into “Isle of Dogs.” His use of film space, which he playfully flattens and deepens, is one of his stylistic signatures; he likes symmetry and, in contrast to most directors these days, does a lot inside the frame. He’s especially inventive in this movie, and I could watch hours of its noble dogs hanging out, sniffing the air. Their relationships are expressed in asides and periodic growls but more poignantly when they are separated in the frame and when they’re gloriously united. (By protecting others, you save yourself.) Here, when a dog looks into the camera, the wind caressing him where a human hand once did, the movie finds its soul."

That kept them around for this sequel, a literary crossover called “Sherlock Gnomes.” The ghost of Arthur Conan Doyle should tell them to get off his lawn.When someone snatches figurines across London, Gnomeo and Juliet (again voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt) team up with a condescending Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp) and Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to crack the case without cracking anyone. (Like the movie, this review needs better wordplay.)VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018Directed by John Stevenson (“Kung Fu Panda”), “Sherlock Gnomes” offers more variety than its predecessor. Although still laced with glib pop culture references (wow, a skinny latte) and scored with Elton John tunes in a way that plays like a concession to adults, it has occasional fun ideas, such as rendering the inner workings of Holmes’s mind in hand-drawn black and white.Turning Holmes’s nemesis Moriarty (Jamie Demetriou, channeling Ricky Gervais) into a Pillsbury-like mascot is good for a laugh or two. As the voice of Irene, Holmes’s jilted paramour in this version, Mary J. Blige belts out a song. On the other hand, the Chinatown trinkets the gnomes encounter cut uncomfortably close to caricature.The biggest problem is that this universe seems limited in its possibilities — imagine “Toy Story” with basically one kind of toy. Robbing Mr. Depp of his indispensable physical presence only highlights the ceramic stiffness of the jokes."

From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn’t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer — an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series “The Crown” — is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn’t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer’s life with quick, grim strokes — a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss — and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there’s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up — ostensibly because she’s a suicide risk — at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it’s obvious who’s who and what’s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn’t belong in the hospital but doesn’t help her case — she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl — which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It’s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy’s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot “Unsane” primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father’s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother’s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer’s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she’s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this — and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (“Carrie”) — suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making “Unsane,” but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall’s footsteps in “The Shining,” another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh’s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh’s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clichés and sadism and just read “Unsane” as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It’s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. “Crickets” is slang for critics, but maybe the movie’s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women’s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn’t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic."

The sensations of youth work on him like Proustian madeleines, though reuniting with his alliteratively named siblings isn’t easy.Juliette (Ana Girardot) is delighted at his return, but Jérémie (François Civil) wonders why his brother — away 10 years — never acknowledged their mother’s death. While Jean’s spoiler-ish reason for not returning then is surprisingly plausible, his estrangement in the intervening time is less so. As “Back to Burgundy” unfolds, it often seems that phone calls or the timely removal of a letter from a jacket pocket might have spared this clan wells of resentment.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018But so it goes with Cédric Klapisch’s comfort-food feature, which is primarily a scenic and knowing ode to traditional winemaking. Mr. Klapisch lingers his camera lovingly over shots of grapes being harvested and stomped, all the while employing story mechanics and flashbacks indelicate enough to suggest the churn of a factory juicer.In a premise that owes something to Olivier Assayas’s acclaimed “Summer Hours,” the semi-globalized siblings must find a way to reconcile their goals and geographies to divide the estate. Jean and his difficulties with his faraway partner (Maria Valverde) get most of the attention, but there are clichés to go around. If Juliette receives the shortest shrift, Jérémie has (in this context) the biggest nightmare: a winemaking father-in-law whose palette doesn’t cut it."

In this documentary, directed by Bert Marcus and Cyrus Saidi, they gush about the genre’s milestones and metaphorically high-five one another while trying not to bore the uninitiated into a drugless stupor.That’s a tricky balancing act. “What We Started” appears to have been conceived with contradictory audiences in mind. On one hand, it tries to present an accessible history of electronic music, starting with its outgrowth from disco, house and techno and continuing through its commercialization and fusion with pop. On the other hand, a subcultural cliquishness creeps into the movie. If you already know all these names and have bought your tickets to Ultra Music Festival, for which “What We Started” could double as a promotion, dig in.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018The aesthetic debates recall the axiom that the bitterest fights have the smallest stakes. We learn about how D.J.s who play prerecorded sets from USB sticks have it too easy and hear arguments about the artistic differences between mass audience EDM and its underground progenitor. An interlude on drug enforcement’s approach to the scene briefly puts the party on hold.For generational contrast, the movie focuses on the British D.J. Carl Cox and the Dutch wunderkind Martin Garrix. A late scene in which they swap notes makes for a vaguely moving torch-passing. It’s a rare moment in “What We Started” that doesn’t treat outsiders like bystanders at a rave."

Chronicling roughly two weeks in Paris in 1964 when the Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush) asked a friend, the American writer James Lord (Armie Hammer), to sit for what would be his last portrait, this flimsy feature from Stanley Tucci is essentially a 90-minute conversation that feels like three hours.ImageClémence Poésy as Caroline, a prostitute and a model for Giacometti, in “Final Portrait.”CreditParisa Taghizadeh/Sony Pictures ClassicsConfined for much of the time to an uncomfortable chair in Giacometti’s dilapidated studio, hair slicked back, attired in an immaculate coat and tie, Lord seems the stoic opposite of his unkempt, mercurial host.“You have the head of a brute,” Giacometti tells his subject, who has of course nothing of the kind. As the camera peers into Lord’s invisible pores, his friend futzes with art supplies and confesses faintly shocking non sequiturs, like his youthful habit of falling asleep by fantasizing about raping and killing women. (“Oh,” responds Lord, barely changing expression.) Musing on the worthlessness of his gift in an age of photography, Giacometti emerges as a testy celebrity who cares as little for the wads of cash delivered by his unflappable brother, Diego (Tony Shalhoub), as he does for the happiness of his long-suffering wife, Annette (an underemployed Sylvie Testud).Relegated to the role of doormat and enabler, Annette watches meekly as her husband indulges his yearslong obsession with his pet prostitute and frequent model, Caroline (Clémence Poésy). A flurry of girlish giggles and empty chatter, Caroline demands, and receives, money and a convertible; Annette, stuck in a crumbling room above the studio, can only bemoan her lack of a functioning kitchen.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 13, 2018As shallowly as they’re drawn, though, the women, swishing in and out during the sittings, disrupt the movie’s stuffy atmosphere and enliven the production designer James Merifield’s somewhat finicky aesthetic. Carefully replicated and filmed on a stage set in London, the studio that the writer Jean Genet reportedly described as “a seething dump” feels airless and artificial. A clutter of emaciated sculptures (created for the movie by hired artists) watch impassively from the sidelines, and plaster dust and cigarette smoke powder every surface. That glaze, in conjunction with Danny Cohen’s velvety cinematography, softens any hard edges or harsh moments.Now and then, brisk restaurant visits and slow strolls through a cemetery (an unnecessary foreshadowing, given the movie’s title) ventilate the film, but “Final Portrait” (adapted from Lord’s 1965 book, “A Giacometti Portrait”) is pretty thin on drama. Mr. Rush’s performance as the selfish, self-doubting genius is never less than diverting, and there’s a smidgen of excitement when Caroline’s pimps wreck the studio (though honestly it’s hard to tell). Otherwise Mr. Tucci’s screenplay remains firmly focused on plumbing an artistic process as dependent on destruction as creation.Neither reaching for nor achieving the level of biopic, “Final Portrait” merely offers a glimpse into a bedeviled life that ended two years after Lord’s sitting. Lord came away with a $20 million artwork; I hope that Annette at least ended up with a decent kitchen."

Here, even the most gentle scenes raise mighty questions.In the 1960s, Jean Vanier founded L’Arche, a community near Paris that has become home to many men and women with developmental disabilities. The filmmakers follow Mr. Vanier, now in his 80s, as he lives and works with those who have Down syndrome and other conditions.Though Mr. Vanier provides some background in his comforting voice-over, we mostly survey L’Arche residents as they go about their lives. Decades ago, it was a radical experiment to remove those with disabilities from institutions. But by doing so, Mr. Vanier says, they have greater freedom and can prompt those without disabilities to redefine what is considered “normal” and “happy.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 16, 2018He’s right. Just watching the residents leads you to confront and change many of your own preconceptions. Still, Randall Wright, the director, can be too content to only observe. The group now operates in dozens of countries, and details on its services and funding are scarce. (Viewers seeking information on L’Arche can find it in several books, including Ian Brown’s profoundly moving “The Boy in the Moon.”)Nonetheless, “Summer in the Forest” remains captivating (it’s a fine companion to “Becoming Bulletproof,” another exceptional recent documentary about those with disabilities), particularly when Mr. Vanier speaks of his mission to bring all people together — hence the group’s name in French, “the ark.” Yet despite his vast optimism, Mr. Vanier realizes the challenges. “L’Arche is not a utopia,” he says. “It’s a hope.”"

(The first version, directed by Jacques Doillon in 1975, never found a U.S. release.) Mr. Duguay chooses to frame this story in a period mode highly influenced by Hollywood pictures. Despite the hardships endured by the characters, nearly every shot seems dappled with nostalgia. The music score is sentimental, with shimmering pianos and trembling strings.But the writing and its attendant characterizations have an undeniable integrity, the particular historical detail offered by the story is not common in films about this era, and the lead performers are moving."

She freestyled some rhymes from the perspective of the girl in the song, punching back with force and style. Her song, “Roxanne’s Revenge,” became a hit, and Lolita transformed into Roxanne Shante, one of the first female hip-hop stars.This origin story may be accurate, but make no mistake: It’s also made for Hollywood. And yet what distinguishes “Roxanne Roxanne,” a sensitively observed new movie with a dynamite performance by Chanté Adams, is that it marries a traditional hip-hop biopic, a form long dominated by male rappers, with a more idiosyncratic and deeply felt slice of life.ImageChanté Adams with Mahershala Ali, who plays Roxanne’s older love interest.CreditNetflixThis movie’s intimate indie vibe is a nice match for the old-school subject, rap stardom in the days before hip-hop culture went global. The director, Michael Larnell, shows you the warts and all, but he nimbly steers clear of another cautionary tale about the evils of show business. Nor is this a superhero story with microphones and Adidas replacing utility belts and capes. (The 1980s period design here is every bit as lovingly recreated as it is on “Stranger Things.”)The music is a backdrop for a gripping, often brutal story of the struggles of a girl growing up poor in Queens. Ms. Adams delivers a compassionate performance as a girl whose swagger and practicality hides a melancholy edge. Stardom changes her life, but less than you’d think. Early scenes show Lolita resorting to petty crime to support her family and butting heads with her strict mother (Nia Long), a compelling character who could use more screen time.And then there’s a small galaxy of men that disappoint or abuse both mother and daughter. As her older love interest, Mahershala Ali gives a silky performance with ominous undertones that never turns into caricature. The scenes between him and Ms. Adams are charged, filmed with a patient if herky-jerky pacing. Some shots linger longer than necessary. At other times, Mr. Larnell cuts quickly, shifting from a shot of sex to pregnancy in a blink.You get a sense of the film’s dramatic priorities from the first scene. Roxanne paces the streets preparing for a rap battle as a crowd of friends trail her. From the look on her face, you can tell she’s formidable, and when she faces off against a guy who scoffs at her, you wait for the virtuoso performance. But then the film cuts away.Don’t worry: There will be rap battles and concert scenes and they do not disappoint. But they are the bass line beat. The drama of ordinary life is what makes this story stick in your head."

John Boyega, who’s also a regular in the new “Star Wars” pictures, stars as Jake Pentecost, the decidedly more roguish son of Idris Elba’s character from 2013’s “Pacific Rim.” He steals parts from scrapped Jaegers — the gigantic human-piloted machines that battled hordes of Kaiju (giant monsters, that is) in the first film. Early in the movie he meets a whiz-kid Jaeger bootlegger named Amara (Cailee Spaeny) and they both end up back in pilot school.With the world supposedly free from Kaiju threat, the movie spends its first hour toggling between “Top Gun”-style cadet rivalries and a corporate espionage plot that’s not unfamiliar, except that you almost never see it done well in this kind of movie.

Scott Eastwood is also on board, and he uses his uncanny resemblance to his father Clint to pleasing effect.Directed by the television veteran Steven S.

His terrific “The Runner,” an exemplar of neorealist-style storytelling first shown in the 1980s, should be more widely available. “A, B, C … Manhattan,” part of a trilogy inspired by his life in New York, experiments with lengthy Steadicam shots in a wandering, day-spanning narrative. You would never identify it as the work of the same filmmaker.A current retrospective of Mr. Naderi’s movies at the Museum of Modern Art includes a run of his latest film, “Monte” — which again tries something totally different. Set in the Middle Ages, this Italian-language feature opens with a funeral. After the protagonist, Agostino (Andrea Sartoretti), a farmer, and his wife, Nina (Claudia Potenza), bury their daughter, his cousins soon depart the settlement. But Agostino wishes to remain where his ancestors lived, and Nina won’t leave their daughter’s grave.Like Albert Serra’s “Quixotic/Honor de Cavalleria,” “Monte” demonstrates how to suggest an epic scale without the means of a Hollywood production. The natural scenery becomes a character. The howl of the wind (and in one brief moment, what sounds jarringly like air traffic) stands in place of a score. “Monte” weds these straightforward elements to a fittingly stark narrative: Agostino sets out to conquer the mountain that keeps his farm barren by chipping away at it bit by bit.The film is limited by its central metaphor, but it is never less than absorbing or original."

The problem with thirtysomething David (Brandon Polansky) is that he doesn’t think he has a condition of any kind. His occasional anxious fits of wheezing he puts down to allergies, and he’s not at all self-conscious about the staggeringly offensive jokes he tells at the wrong time to the wrong people.

Sarah has a winning and nearly constant smile and a startling openness. The film, written and directed by Rachel Israel, respects these characters by portraying their whole, unfiltered selves.In many respects the romance that develops between David and Sarah is like a conventional one. There’s even an “it’s not you, it’s me” conversation. The movie grows more moving as David gets real with himself about his own loneliness, and his rich parents’ bigotry and denial. (The parents are played by the veteran actors Jessica Walter and Tibor Feldman, and they work well with Mr. Polansky and Ms. Elisofon.) “Keep the Change” is not a seamlessly crafted movie, but it’s awfully tenderhearted and thoroughly disarming.

As the hollow-eyed, foulmouthed Danny, Jack Roth (a dead ringer for his father, Tim Roth) is alive with unpredictable menace. Equal parts grit and grandiosity, he views himself as a fed-up political rebel, railing in monologue against one-percenters. Social warrior or just plain sociopath, he has frustrations that are real; and as he and his balaclava-wearing accomplices (Andrew Tiernan and Daniel Kendrick) terrorize their hostages, the film’s jazzy tone and nervy editing — Guy Ritchie’s stylistic fingerprints are all over it — hustle us along.Tapping into a vein of blue-collar resentment that’s both thematically rich and uncomfortably current, the writer and director, Joseph Martin, is not above using tricks to bolster an occasionally sagging narrative. Split screens, a fractured timeline and a soundtrack that skids from The Damned to Vivaldi help us push past an unfortunate episode of torture, and Stefan Mitchell’s stellar camerawork highlights the plot’s unexpected emotional shifts.A switchback of mixed motives and ping-ponging sympathies, “Us and Them” declines to go all in for its working stiffs.

Then it’s off to the Dairy Queen with her two sidekicks to crow over a caper she’s enacted several times before.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018Cruelly amoral and only marginally credible, “Flower” is nevertheless wildly entertaining and at times even touching. Antic and impulsive, Erica is a smart, damaged bully whose father is in prison and whose mother, Laurie (the great Kathryn Hahn), would rather befriend than parent. The teenager also has a strange fixation on penises, which she gratifies by having close encounters with as many as possible and sketching them in a notebook. It’s all very cute, until Laurie’s boyfriend and his deeply troubled son (Tim Heidecker and Joey Morgan) move in and the narrative dives off a cliff.Even so, the fall is propelled by such zippy dialogue and unexpectedly sweet moments (Erica and Laurie’s relationship, especially, is warmly believable) that you may not care. The supporting players — including Adam Scott as a possibly skeevy high school teacher — are all strong, and the director, Max Winkler (son of Henry), never breaks stride. Making liberal use of dizzying close-ups, he swerves from dark coming-of-age comedy to outright horror, refusing to punish Erica for behavior that grows ever more appalling.Yet Ms. Deutch is so engaging, and so adept at selling her wounded character, that damned if we don’t want to give Erica a pass, too."

Set in a particularly idyllic Atlanta suburb, replete with lifestyle wish-fulfillment production design, it’s the kind of movie in which the filmmakers signal their exquisite taste by proxy. (Said filmmakers are the director Greg Berlanti and the screenwriters Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, adapting a novel by Becky Albertalli.) For instance, when Simon, the lead character, needs to choose an email address from which to send a series of love letters to an anonymous subject, he adapts a lyric from the Kinks’ classic album “Something Else by the Kinks.” Which Simon enjoys on vinyl, of course.VideoA preview of the filmPublished OnMarch 6, 2018The reason for the anonymity is that the high schooler Simon is, like his correspondent, gay. He hasn’t come out largely because he’s not sure how to go about doing so, and his continuing reluctance gets him enmeshed with a thoroughly obnoxious weasel of a blackmailer. The blackmailer’s aim is simple: He wants to gain a romantic advantage with one of Simon’s female friends, and while Simon is in a sense too smart for this nonsense, he reluctantly complies.In the movie’s last third it gains a lot of guts. Simon has to contend with the fallout from what he considered a necessary hypocrisy and the personal betrayals it entailed. The emotional resonance may be surprising given the movie’s relentless gloss, but it’s real. The spectacularly charming cast, led by the young Nick Robinson in the title role (who brings a knowing touch of 1980s Matthew Broderick to some of his line readings), puts it all across, including a genuinely crowd-pleasing ending."

Sexed down and pumped up, Ms. Vikander certainly looks the role, with flowing hair and a washboard stomach you could play the blues on. She runs, jumps and leaps into this yawning void with grim determination.There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and “Tomb Raider” goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun. When you first meet Lara Croft, she’s doing the poor little rich girl thing in London, working as a bike messenger and kick boxing in her off hours. Her globe-traveling zillionaire father (Dominic West) disappeared years ago while chasing down a Japanese goddess of death or some such. Refusing to accept either his death or her inheritance, she ends up taking her daddy issues to Asia.First, Lara runs around Hong Kong, where she hires a cute boozer captain (an underused Daniel Wu) who instantly sobers up and takes her to a mysterious isle. There, she runs and runs some more, dodging danger and villains who are also searching for her father’s mystery goddess. The lead baddie is a cookie-cutter scoundrel, but at least he’s played by Walton Goggins, a skilled mustache twirler (as he regularly proved on the TV show “Justified.”) Looking rather like a midcareer Bruce Dern here, Mr. Goggins oils up his rust-bucket role enough to give it a hint of personality.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018Ms. Vikander barely manages to do the same with Lara, a center who can’t hold. An appealing performer who popped off the screen as the enigmatic android in “Ex Machina,” Ms. Vikander never settles comfortably into Lara, whether she’s delivering the empty, often risible dialogue or running the movie’s endless obstacle course. She has a trained ballet dancer’s familiar amalgam of silk and steel — the fluid gestures, the ramrod posture — and she can move beautifully, as she showed in “Ex Machina.” Here, though, she often seems to be trying too hard; at times you can almost see her thinking about the marks she needs to hit. You see the strain, not the play.And without play, there’s nothing left but franchise fumes. The first “Tomb Raider” movies are ridiculous, but they have their minor satisfactions, not least being Ms. Jolie’s badass superbabe. A video game heroine turned media franchise, Lara Croft, with her pneumatic breasts and heavy guns, always came off as an onanistic cartoon for 12-year-old boys. With her amused smile and self-possession, Ms. Jolie seemed happy to strut around in Lara’s shorts and big boots, but she also seemed to be there for her own pleasure, which she made easy for girls (and women) to share. Ms. Vikander doesn’t yet have that kind of self-possession, but one day might.No one person deserves all the credit or blame for an industrial product like “Tomb Raider”; one place to start griping, though, is with those who signed off on its script. (The writers are Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.) The director Roar Uthaug knows how to work on a sizable scale as he proved in “The Wave,” an amusing nail-biter about a tsunami that sweeps away a Norwegian paradise. But he can’t make “Tomb Raider” work on any level or in any location. At times, he seems to be playing with genre, particularly when Lara hits the island and begins pinballing from peril to peril, but the action is leaden, dispirited and finally dispiriting.The art of the blockbuster is too rarely acknowledged. It takes a true skill set and a distinct pop sensibility to turn a large-scale commercial property with no pretense to art and a great many moving parts into a smoothly enjoyable diversion. A fat budget can help, but more crucial still is a director who takes evanescent cinematic pleasures seriously. Jan de Bont, who directed the 2003 “Tomb Raider” sequel (and the first “Speed”) could sometimes hit that sweet spot; Steven Spielberg always dependably does, and Steven Soderbergh can, when he feels like it. Of course it helps if a director has something actually to do beyond rummaging in a boneyard like this."

Between lectures on the evils of capitalism, he advises Tatiana on how best to overthrow her school’s slutty queen bees. Darlene, for her part, is too impressed by their guest’s plumbing skills and perfect mole to wonder if he’s dangerous. Anyway, having your toes sucked daily by your married boss (a greasy Seth Green) leaves little time to fear for your life.Simultaneously preposterous and dull, “Dear Dictator” is the kind of movie where music and wardrobe choices — like the mean girls’ stridently visible underwear — substitute for character. Ms. Rush is believably disaffected but struggles to anchor a plot lousy with loose ends and lazily drawn relationships. As for Mr. Caine, never one to be fazed by the ludicrous, he plays Anton as less murderous tyrant than grandfatherly codger. If, that is, your grandfather just happens to be a whiz at waterboarding."

An opening title card offers some context: Since 2013, patients in France who have been involuntarily committed to psychiatric hospitals must be “presented to a freedom and detention judge” within 12 days and then, if needed, every six months. That’s pretty much all the background that the director Raymond Depardon provides in this movie, which suggests that the line between mental illness and health is sometimes determined by who tells your story and how. For those who have long been silenced — and often remain so — being able to tell those stories is clearly monumental.The documentary largely consists of patient-judge interviews, which take place in small, nearly identical-looking institutional rooms. The spaces are sterile and anonymous, and the exchanges insistently informal; no one wears a suit and tie or announces the judges. The patients are accompanied by an advocate or two who speak on their behalf, at times sharing medical reports. Occasionally, other men and women quietly sit behind the patients; perhaps, you intuit, these are nurses or orderlies. The judges — polite, direct yet reserved — ask and at times answer questions.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018The interviews look deceptively placid. Using a fixed camera and a mix of medium shots and head-and-shoulder close-ups, Mr. Depardon maintains a distance from everyone in the interview rooms, a vantage that could be characterized as respectful or maybe disinterested. Although he effectively announces his presence in the opening — the camera snakes through a long, severely impersonal hall, like someone searching for an entrance or an exit — Mr. Depardon seems to disappear during the interviews. Instead, as he cuts between the patients and the judges, the larger documentary seems to fade away, leaving face-to-face interactions that are by turns eerie, touching and tragic.The patients seem either accepting of their situation or resistant. Some speak clearly and with equanimity, making their case for freedom; one nearly vibrates with anger; one weeps; another expresses her wish to die. One man sounds heavily drugged, and soon his tale suggests why he might be. Each patient’s story has its rhythm and logic (or lack thereof), its pathos and complexity. The judges listen attentively and sometimes seem to know the answers to their questions, deliberating almost too quickly. Some things remain unanswered, and Mr. Depardon, a veteran photojournalist and documentarian whose films include “Fait Divers,” doesn’t try to fill in the blanksEvery so often, Mr. Depardon folds in exterior images of men and women milling around outside the building. In one such sequence, an older man paces inside a small patch of gated lawn, a curtain of mist wavering in the background. It’s a wintry, melancholic scene made somewhat sadder by the tinkling of some dolorous piano music. (Alexandre Desplat composed the minimalist score.) As this lonely man paces back and forth, it would be easy to see him as merely an inmate. What Mr. Depardon would like you to see, I think, in this lucid, focused and adamant documentary is something more profound: a man who, whatever the threat he might pose to himself or to others, deserves basic human rights."

The homogenized factory wine produced under the Soviets — pronounced “garbage” by one Georgian and necessitating the destruction of hundreds of varieties of grapes — is a stain that these dedicated craftsmen are eager to erase. Employing an underground fermenting method many thousands of years old, they bury the grape slurry in handmade clay pots. Nine months later, a delicious drink is born, its initial tasting typically described as a sacred experience. An ecstatic Mr. Quinn concurs.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018Between sips, various experts — an archaeologist here, an ethnographer there — are consulted, their sober contributions grounding the wine in Georgia’s turbulent history. And though the movie’s loose, sampling style can leave regions and varieties poorly differentiated, its real stars are the vintners. Young or old, entrepreneur or family-only producer, all are passionate and poetic about their beloved beverage. After hearing one claim his thriving vines were owed not to fertilizer, but to soil soaked in the blood of centuries of invaders, you might never understand the term “full-bodied” in quite the same way again."

Laura, played by Evan Rachel Wood with her usual commendable concentration and attention to detail, works for a home-cleaning company run by her father (Denis O’Hare). In one of the houses she looks after there’s a delicate 16-year-old girl, Eva (Julia Sarah Stone), who’s locked in a battle with her mother. The two form a tentative friendship over music and weed, and soon Laura has Eva at her home, and very much wants her to stay — to the extent that she forces the issue, to say the least, first through wheedling, then through locked doors.After Laura convinces the police that she had nothing to do with Eva’s disappearance, the film becomes a character study of one lost soul trying to engulf another. Laura’s behavior once Eva settles in is discomfiting. She acts as both a gentle lover and an egocentric, vengeful parent figure. In a number of scenes, the characters are framed in doorways and hallways, the camera maintaining a distance that I suppose it wishes the viewer to take as discreet. I saw the strategy as more to do with withholding, and I think it backfires.The filmmakers seem less concerned with telling a story than in convincing the audience (and maybe themselves) that they can handle this provocative and potentially exploitive material they’ve contrived with what’s conventionally considered “appropriate” sensitivity. That consideration, which might be a bad-faith one to begin with, becomes moot well before this grim cinematic exercise ends."

A result of this visual flatness is that some sequences drag with clichés, as the camera dithers on hackneyed images like Lexi flushing her wedding ring down the motel sink.But in the scenes that break with banality, there is a zing not only of originality, but of daring. The film’s most memorable sequence is a sex scene in which Lexi acts out a prostitution fantasy, inviting a man to her room only to be shocked when her conquest brings a friend without asking for her permission. As Lexi maneuvers the two men, seeking ways to regain the control that was taken from her, Ms. Sealey navigates power through nudity, physically and psychologically exposing her male subjects while allowing her female protagonist to remain an enigma. In a film of mostly mixed merits, such mysterious highs sustain the mundane lows."

Sherriff, who fought in the war himself. The first movie version, directed by James Whale with Colin Clive, opened in 1930, a year before their immortal work in “Frankenstein.” The new film’s air of stodgy nobility resembles that of “The Four Feathers” (1939), one of many movies for which Mr. Sherriff wrote the screenplay.The scene is 1918 in the north of France. British units take turns rotating into the front lines, where a German attack is imminent. A newcomer, Raleigh (Asa Butterfield), has pushed to serve under Captain Stanhope (Sam Claflin), his sister’s sweetheart, danger notwithstanding. Osborne (Paul Bettany), a father figure in the company who insists that the men call him “uncle,” warns Raleigh that he’ll find the shell-shocked Stanhope changed.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018If you felt “Dunkirk” lacked a sufficient human dimension, this slightly monotonous film puts that up front, as the troops wait in suspense, banter with the cook (Toby Jones) and plot strategy. The director, Saul Dibb, alternately embraces and hedges against the staginess, with sweeping camera movements through the trenches indebted to Stanley Kubrick’s “Paths of Glory.”Yet early screen depictions of World War I, like “The Big Parade” and “All Quiet on the Western Front,” show more passion and visual invention. A rattling sound design and the cinematographer Laurie Rose’s excellent use of low light aren’t enough to make the experience immediate."

Over-narrated and self-serious, this documentary allows its good intentions to pave the way to a tepid tale.Centering on Osamu Tomita, who runs one of Japan’s most-praised ramen restaurants, the film follows him and a few other chefs as they mix broth, cook noodles and greet customers. We’re told that making and eating ramen can be a quasi-religious experience. Slow-motion footage, instrumental music and loving close-ups of ingredients do all they can to drive that point home.What the film lacks, though, is a strong reason to watch. Unlike the obsession witnessed in “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” or the drollness of “The Search for General Tso,” “Ramen Heads” usually forgoes a driving theme or story line. Other than late scenes charting Mr. Tomita’s plans for his shop’s 10th anniversary celebration, food preparation is the overwhelming motif, leading to myriad shots of boiling pots and steaming meals.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018The director Koki Shigeno and his crew move smoothly around cramped kitchens and tiny dining rooms. And little here seems staged or scrubbed for the cameras, providing a sense of authenticity.But the interviews aren’t as insightful, and the narration often delivers odd pronouncements via subtitle. In the first moments it is said that ramen imparts “a feeling like the warm, glowing memory of a lover.” Another scene shows a restaurant where “patrons engage deeply with their bowls,” while a late segment proclaims that the taste of certain dishes “feels nostalgic, even if the memories are not our own.” All of that can be a lot to chew on."

It combines a reference to the world’s most populous country, the People’s Republic of China, with the name of a sparsely peopled American state. The visual contrast between the two places is striking, and symbolic of the cultural differences that are the film’s subject.The China that Ms. Wang depicts is a megalopolis of gleaming skyscrapers and breakneck economic growth. Maine moves at a slower pace. It’s a landscape of woods and quiet lakes, with a few buildings nestled among the hills, notably the dormitories and classrooms of Fryeburg Academy, a private school founded in 1792.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 12, 2018As the school’s admissions director explains during a trip to China to interview applicants, Fryeburg, which has both boarding and day students, depends on the tuition paid by the parents of foreign students. In the past, those pupils (and that money) came mostly from Japan and South Korea, but since the end of the 2008 economic crisis, China has emerged as a leading exporter of ambitious teenagers from affluent families.Two of them — Harry and Stella — are the focus of Ms. Wang’s astute and absorbing film. Their time at Fryeburg changes them in subtle ways. They adjust to some degree to life in America and to the individualistic ethos of American education, but the experience also affirms their sense of Chinese identity. They arrive carrying the baggage of parental expectations, and assert their own contrary desires and ambitions in a spirit of negotiation and compromise rather than rebellion.Ms. Wang, whose previous feature is the sensitive and elliptical “Beijing Taxi” (2010), is less interested in explaining than in listening and observing. “Maineland” takes up a large and complicated set of topics — the global economy, the shifting relations between East and West, the commodification of American education — and addresses them with understated delicacy. Harry and Stella and their friends may be part of an important social and demographic trend, but they’re also kids: shy, smart, silly, thoughtful and self-absorbed.ImageHarry, a student in the United States, is a focus of the documentary.CreditAbramoramaTheir interactions with the Mainers at Fryeburg are sometimes uncomfortable and sometimes comical, as efforts at cross-cultural communications tend to be. It’s sometimes hard to judge how successfully the Chinese students have been integrated into the daily life of the school. They tend to stick together, and to be regarded with a curiosity that sometimes verges on suspicion. A sign in a common area of one building declares it an English-only zone, which could be interpreted both as an encouragement to develop social and language skills and as an alienating, hostile gesture.But good will and hard work are the prevailing values of “Maineland.” The portmanteau title maps out a patch of common ground defined by the understanding that education is a path to worldly success. It can be more than that, of course, and the movie hints at complications that are all the more intriguing for remaining largely unstated. One of the dogmas of American schooling is the importance of critical thinking, a slogan dutifully cited by Chinese applicants to Fryeburg in their interviews.By the time they graduate, Harry and Stella have begun to question themselves and the world in ways neither their parents nor their teachers could necessarily have predicted. You might wish you had gotten to know them a little better — Ms. Wang stops short of emotional or psychological intimacy — but it is hard not to be curious about what will happen to them after Maine. I’ll keep my fingers crossed for a sequel."

The mission leader was Yonatan Netanyahu, older brother of Israel’s current prime minister.Within a year, no fewer than three movies about the raid were released, two of them on American television networks. The aggregate cast of those projects is a virtual encyclopedia of ‘70s celebrity, a startling compendium of has-beens and up-and-comers. In “Raid on Entebbe,” Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, was played by Peter Finch, and the Ugandan leader, Idi Amin Dada, was played by Yaphet Kotto. If you preferred Burt Lancaster as Shimon Peres (Israel’s defense minister at the time of the incident) along with Linda Blair, Kirk Douglas and Elizabeth Taylor, you could opt for “Victory at Entebbe.” “Operation Thunderbolt,” with a mostly Israeli cast, had Klaus Kinski as one of the hijackers.José Padilha’s “7 Days in Entebbe,” a reasonably efficient action movie, is thus both an update and a throwback. It features an international ensemble of well-known actors playing real historical figures, and tries to balance geopolitical sobriety with suspense-thriller sensationalism.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 6, 2018Mr. Padilha, the Brazilian director of the “Elite Squad” movies, the “RoboCop” reboot and the superb documentary “Bus 174,” balances some of the pomp and stiffness of those old made-for-TV extravaganzas with the lean, politically nuanced objectivity of recent films about ’70s terrorism. There have been a lot of those, from different countries and perspectives — “Munich,” “Carlos,” “The Baader Meinhof Complex” — and “7 Days in Entebbe” joins their company without adding much to the genre.The story proceeds, day by day, from right before the hijacking to the aftermath of the rescue. Parallel stories unfold, each showing the tensions and divisions within one of the sides. On the plane and in the terminal — and in a few flashbacks — some of the militants air their doubts and debate tactics and ideology. The focus is not on the Palestinians but on Wilfried Böse (Daniel Brühl) and Brigitte Kuhlmann (Rosamund Pike), German leftists associated with the Baader-Meinhof group and drawn to the Palestinian cause. Wilfried experiences some qualms about the implications of being a German holding Jews at gunpoint, while Brigitte gobbles pills and maintains an air of steely ruthlessness.Meanwhile, Peres (Eddie Marsan) and Rabin (Lior Ashkenazi) are engaged in a complicated battle of wills. Peres, portrayed as an unsentimental hard-liner — an interesting contrast to his later dovish reputation — pushes the prime minister, a more emotional and indecisive man, to approve a risky military response. Rabin, worried about the safety of the hostages and his own political future, broaches the previously taboo idea of negotiating with terrorists.As the decisive moment draws near, Mr. Padilha uses a dance performance — by a company that includes the girlfriend of an Israeli soldier — to amplify the suspense and vary the film’s visual texture. It’s a halfway-effective conceit, showcasing his skill at pacing and crosscutting and relieving some of the claustrophobia of the tense indoor scenes in Entebbe and Tel Aviv. But the choreography also emphasizes the shallowness of the film, which gestures toward relevance without finding a coherent historical or political point of view.What should unfold like an unsettling chapter in a long, tragic story — or a tale of cruelty and heroism — feels more like an old TV show. Everybody is going through the motions."

Now “Eight Hours Don’t Make a Day,” a five-episode series shown on West German television in 1972 and 1973, arrives at Film Forum, where it’s screening in three chunks. Once again, here is a work that — in the generosity of its scope and the sophistication of its staging — makes Mr. Fassbinder look more inventive than just about any filmmaker working today.Screened earlier this year at MoMA’s “To Save and Project” festival, “Eight Hours” has played in the United States before. The New York Times reported its presence in a program at the Museum of Broadcasting in 1983, at least. But the new restoration, from the original 16-millimeter film, probably represents the best it’s ever looked, given its original airing on tube television. (Movies-versus-TV debates inevitably hit a wall with Mr. Fassbinder, whose broadcast dramas had a habit of turning up theatrically outside his home country.)Yet this so-called “family series,” an ensemble portrait of an extended clan in a West German city, is also a complete surprise — funnier, more humane and more optimistic than anything in the Fassbinder canon. The plot pivots on the relationship between Jochen (Gottfried John) and Marion (the ever-luminous Hanna Schygulla), a working-class couple who meet cute when he helps her to extract a stuck pickle jar from a vending machine. Soon, to the delight of Jochen’s family and the tut-tutting of Marion’s busybody colleague (Irm Hermann), Marion has dumped her white-collar boyfriend for Jochen, and they set about building a life.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnMarch 12, 2018Anyone familiar with the doomed fruit seller of Mr. Fassbinder’s “The Merchant of Four Seasons,” the luckless lottery winner of his “Fox and His Friends,” or the Weimar-era ne’er-do-well hero of his “Berlin Alexanderplatz” (with Mr. John as a villain as treacherous as Jochen is good-hearted) is forgiven for expecting the worst. While few characters in “Eight Hours” wind up dead or humiliated, it’s not as if Mr. Fassbinder’s bleak worldview has entirely gone away.That “Eight Hours” is a comedy — or perhaps a tragedy stopped short — owes something to both design and chance. According to the film scholar Brad Prager, Mr. Fassbinder told a contemporaneous interviewer that he wanted to leave a broad TV audience with a sense that the world was full of possibilities. On the other hand, West German television, which commissioned the project, pulled the plug before the director was able to film the last three episodes, in which he had planned to lower the hammer.But “Eight Hours” nevertheless feels complete, a lighthearted polemic that is at once a soft-Marxist guide on how to band together to improve your workplace and an almost traditionalist ode to family and community. Jochen, a factory worker who makes specialized tools, leads his fellow laborers in pushing for their friend’s promotion. Wishing to turn a shuttered library into a day care center, Grandma (Luise Ullrich), the strong-willed matriarch, and her new companion, Gregor (Werner Finck), don’t wait for city permission.As always, the polish of Mr. Fassbinder’s direction is a marvel; none of his 1970s contemporaries ever used zooms to better comic effect. And for a man who found time to make more than 40 features in his 37 years, the fluidity of his camera and blocking is miraculous — particularly in a nearly half-hour wedding-party sequence at the end of Episode 4.For sheer joy per minute of film, there’s nothing playing now that comes close."

A comic talent who should be household famous, he is best known for “Veep,” the HBO series about Washington politics that was a satire when it first hit in 2012 but now seems like a reality show. He also directed the movie “In the Loop,” an aptly obscene burlesque about the run-up to the Iraq War. He only seems to have abandoned contemporary politics in his latest, “The Death of Stalin,” an eccentric comic shocker about a strong man and his world of ashes and blood.The laughs come in jolts and waves in “The Death of Stalin,” delivered in a brilliantly arranged mix of savage one-liners, lacerating dialogue and perfectly timed slapstick that wouldn’t be out of place in a Three Stooges bit. Turning horror into comedy is nothing new, but Mr. Iannucci’s unwavering embrace of these seemingly discordant genres as twin principles is bracing. In “The Death of Stalin,” fear is so overwhelming, so deeply embedded in everyday life that it distorts ordinary expression, utterances, gestures and bodies. It has turned faces into masks (alternately tragic and comic), people into caricatures, death into a punch line.VideoA preview of the filmPublished OnFeb. 27, 2018The movie opens in early March 1953. The iron-fisted Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin), 74, has ruled the Soviet Union for decades and racked up countless crimes against humanity and millions of victims. A near-monosyllabic thug with a helmet of steel-gray hair and a retinue of flatterers — Khrushchev and Molotov are among the names crowding this familiar roll call — Stalin likes classical music and old westerns, a casual reminder that barbarism and civilization are often partners in crime. Squirreled away in a dacha, a relatively modest woodland retreat at a remove from the Kremlin, Stalin kicks back with his toadies only to fall grievously ill later that same evening.He briefly hangs on, gasping but mute, throwing his nominal comrades in arms into a fast-spiraling panic. The most appealing, or rather the least obviously terrible, of these is Khrushchev (a superb Steve Buscemi), the minister of agriculture and a cunning, outwardly drab schemer. Like a seasoned standup, Khrushchev tells his wife which of his jokes made Stalin laugh, an accounting that she dutifully preserves for future reference. When he learns that Stalin has taken ill, Khrushchev hastily pulls a jacket and pants over his pajamas and rushes to his side, where Beria (Simon Russell Beale, brilliant), the head of the secret police, the N.K.V.D., has already taken up position and begun plotting.“The Death of Stalin” is based on graphic novels by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin, and Mr. Nury shares writing credit here with Mr. Iannucci, David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows. It’s a seamless effort that comes alive with a dazzling ensemble that includes Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, a preening military force, and Michael Palin as Molotov, a first deputy prime minister. When the story opens, Molotov has no inkling that he’s about to make a miraculous escape. Like the rest of Stalin’s men, he has helped create a world of bureaucratically administered terror, one in which each bullet to the head is rationalized on a neatly typed hit list. And now he’s on such a list.Mr. Iannucci draws from history with its competing narratives, bending it to his purposes. Real traumas and outrages are mentioned in passing, rather than dutifully explained; there’s a brief look inside the gulag, for instance, with its desperate prisoners and splatters of blood. For the most part, though, the Stalin-era atrocities are the ghastly background for the frantic intrigue of his hangers on. Khrushchev soon emerges as one of the canniest of these survivors, though Beria moves faster and initially with far more lethal force. Soon after Stalin finally dies, Beria sends out his own kill list, embracing — as Selina Meyer of “Veep” once put it — continuity with change.ImageFrom left, Mr. Crowley, Paul Whitehouse, Mr. Buscemi, Mr. Tambor and Paul Chahidi.CreditNicola Dove/IFC FilmsThe action shifts to Moscow and assorted gruesome and grandiose interiors in which Khrushchev and the rest take turns organizing the funeral and their own uncertain futures. Karl Marx increasingly gives way to the Marx Brothers as Stalin’s son and daughter (the contrapuntal Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough) rush in to wail and thunder, adding absurdity and self-dramatizing melodrama to the mix. There are secret meetings, crowds of mourners, visiting dignitaries and more secret meetings. Mr. Iannucci is particularly good at the theater of sycophancy and at all the ways in which supplicating faces, hands and bodies can quiver in fear and with a terrible love.“The Death of Stalin” is by turns entertaining and unsettling, with laughs that morph into gasps and uneasy gasps that erupt into queasy, choking laughs. Mr. Iannucci’s decision to have the performers speak in an array of accented English — from Brooklyn to Cockney — carries some political resonance, suggesting that totalitarianism knows no borders. But it also makes the familiar strange, creating a Brechtian alienation that few movies succeed in pulling off. Mr. Buscemi plays Khrushchev with persuasive realism, and he certainly looks the part, with his bald head and boxy clothing. But the character’s Brooklyn accent also underscores Mr. Buscemi’s identity, making him present, too.This doubling in which both the actor and the character wave at the audience is also a familiar comic strategy, one used by the likes of Bugs Bunny and Jim Carrey. It fits for a movie in which almost all the characters have been playing variations on the same role of slavishly adoring, lethally submissive servant. Stalin hasn’t taken his final breath before Beria and Khrushchev stop playing those roles; others, like Molotov and Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), the deputy prime minister and Stalin’s heir apparent, scarcely seem to have anything left except their long-enacted performances.In his book “The Last Days of Stalin,” Joshua Rubenstein captures the dictator’s power over the Soviet Union in a quote: “Stalin was inside everyone, like the hammer alongside the sickle in every mind.” In Mr. Iannucci’s movie, you see the hammer and the sickle in each pale, scheming face, in every prison cell and bootlicker’s smile. It’s in Beria’s every move and there when Malenkov puts on a dolorous face and a corset, setting the timer for his own end. There are times when Mr. Iannucci seems as merciless as he is funny; hope can seem very distant here. Yet he also suggests — with the help of a pianist played by Olga Kurylenko and the example of his movie — that art is one sure path to resistance."

From the very first shot, tight and merciless, Charlotte Rampling’s pale, stricken countenance sets the tone of “Hannah” and dominates virtually every moment thereafter. By the end, we feel so wrung out it takes a second or two to realize that very little has happened.This is partly because the movie, with implacable sterility, gradually nudges its title character toward a threatened tipping point. Details are sparse and dialogue scant as Hannah, an older resident of an unidentified Belgian city, sees her husband off to prison for an unspecified (but, eventually, horribly clear) crime. Later, she will feed her dog, water her plant and attend an acting class as, one by one, social and familial connections are cruelly severed. Her husband’s actions have built a wall around them both.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018Rigorously structured and glacially paced, this sophomore feature from Andrea Pallaoro (after his 2015 family tragedy, “Medeas”) is a minimalist portrait of brutal isolation and extreme emotional anguish. Colder and more distant — and, I believe, more difficult to access — than the earlier film, it fetishizes a woman unseen to the point of erasure. A young couple fights in front of her on the subway as if they were alone; the boy who lives in the house she cleans is completely blind.Working in lovely 35-millimeter film and a studiously neutral palette, the cinematographer Chayse Irvin employs austerity and stillness like goads, daring the audience to look away. Shots are held so silently, and for so long, that watching becomes transfixingly stressful. Only a handful of actors could tolerate this degree of scrutiny, but Ms. Rampling doesn’t balk: Hannah’s face may tremble, but we sense more than a hint of steel underneath."

They’re mostly male, mostly screenwriters or directors, and they’re mostly very heavy drinkers. Although they’re more confused than is considered healthy even when they’re sober. One thing about these characters is that you’d never know they worked in movies if they didn’t mention it in the dialogue. Mr. Hong’s camera almost never depicts movie sets.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018CreditCreditCinema GuildSo it stands to reason, then, that although “Claire’s Camera,” the latest of Mr. Hong’s films to open in New York, was shot in Cannes, a little beach town on the French Riviera known for hosting perhaps the most famous film festival in the world, there’s nary a glimpse of ritz and glamour to be seen. Yes, the movie opens in a makeshift Korean film sales office, and on one of its doors hangs a poster for Mr. Hong’s 2016 movie, “Yourself and Yours.” But there’s no red carpet, no paparazzi, and the beach the characters visit seems far from the cinema palaces of Cannes.The relatively plain settings allow the filmmaker to do what he does best: focus on his characters, whose befuddlement is sometimes funny and sometimes troubling. In a maddeningly elliptical conversation at a café table outside, a young assistant, Man-hee (Kim Min-hee, of the 2016 film “The Handmaiden”), is fired by her boss, Yang-hye (Chang Mi-hee). As it happens, Man-hee had a one-night stand with the director So Wan-soo (Jung Jin-young), who is officially dating Yang-hye, albeit perhaps on the sly. “Ninety-five percent of the mistakes” in his life, he muses, have been because of drinking.Into this awkward triangle walks Claire, a French schoolteacher with a blue Polaroid camera. The cinephile joke is that Claire, played by French cinema royalty Isabelle Huppert, has never been to the festival before. “If I take a photo of you, you are not the same person anymore,” she tells So, as he gets increasingly drunk at lunch. It’s possible that Claire’s camera also alters the stream of time itself, as the story line introduces some elements of temporal dislocation while never shifting into an obvious sci-fi mode. In the meantime, the movie offers up pertinent and dispiriting observations on gender relations, particularly in one scene in which the loathsomely hypocritical So tries to dress down Man-hee for wearing what he considers too-revealing attire at a cocktail party. Ms. Huppert’s presence — steady, warm, thoughtful but with a casual air — keeps the entire enterprise classically comedic."

He describes two ways of approaching the world: “You can walk on the path, or you can walk through the hedge.” It’s almost a given that this documentary about his ephemeral, nature-based art will eventually show him trudging through a hedge, oblivious to or uninterested in the perfectly functional sidewalk next to it.“Leaning Into the Wind” is a de facto sequel to “Rivers and Tides” (2003), by the same director, Thomas Riedelsheimer. Because time erases or alters Mr. Goldsworthy’s sculptures, movies are the ideal medium to capture them (although with the sequel, the switch from 35-millimeter film to digital cinematography has removed some of the artisanal quality).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018The surprise of “Leaning Into the Wind” is that it’s just as concerned with how time has changed Mr. Goldsworthy. His grown daughter Holly now assists him with projects, including one in which they capture the hoof prints of sheep. Mr. Goldsworthy explains the evolution of his views on cities, and his desire to locate the nature beneath them. (Cut to San Francisco, with its wildly uneven sidewalks.)The title comes from a kind of performance piece in which the artist leans into extremely high cliff winds and doesn’t fall. There’s no warning not to try this at home — which is regrettable, given how many viewers the movie seems poised to captivate with Mr. Goldsworthy’s worldview."

There’s a lot of low-lying fog before the masked killers come a-calling, and a lot of arterial stab wounds after they show up.The film, directed by Johannes Roberts, shamelessly lifts from several better horror movies. To give you an idea of how low I’m setting the bar in terms of “better,” one scene simultaneously cribs from the no-budget Southern cult film “The Mutilator” (1984) and the ultra-gory and occasionally goofy Italian shocker “Zombie” (1979).VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018If you recognize those films, you might find yourself mildly diverted by this tawdry, occasionally effective shock-delivery device. Watching it with a demonstrative crowd in a Times Square theater proved to this former grindhouse devotee that sometimes you can go home again, at least momentarily. That said, the movie’s ludicrously drawn-out finale sapped the good will out of some of my fellow audience members. “That movie should be rated ‘D’ for “Dumb,” one of them groused on the way out of the theater."

You learn in short order that the horse is a goner, and it isn’t long into this slick, shallow movie that you wish the girl, Amanda (Olivia Cooke), was, too. This is no fault of Ms. Cooke, an appealing performer (she was the girl in “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”). She and her equally likable co-star, Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Witch”), have been burdened with giving their matching ciphers flesh and a reason for us to watch.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018Ms. Taylor-Joy plays Lily, a wealthy teenager who is tutoring Amanda when the story begins. Amanda, who’s more middle-class comfortable, knows that Lily is getting paid for her attention, which doesn’t stop the girls from curiously circling each other. They were once friends and soon ease into a new, unpersuasive intimacy (they watch Shirley Temple on TV), largely so the writer-director Cory Finley can make them combust. What happens next is pretty much what you would expect from peewee nihilists (“Heathers”) adrift in a bourgeois hellscape of quiet dinners and symmetrical visuals (“American Beauty”).Making his feature directing debut, Mr. Finley gives the movie a professional sheen and gets fine performances from his actors, including Anton Yelchin as a sad sack with a bull’s-eye where his brains should be, and Paul Sparks as Lily’s chilled-to-the-bone stepfather. Nothing these two characters do or say is surprising. Yet both actors give their roles a spark of life — Mr. Yelchin lends the movie heart in one of his final performances, Mr. Sparks gives it a touch of realistic cunning — that let you see where this movie might have gone if Mr. Finley hadn’t relied on formula.For all the chatter and intrigue, Mr. Finley never settles on a point or theme. At times, he seems invested in performing a cultural autopsy on Lily and Amanda, opening them up so we can see the pathologies crawling inside. At other times, he seems to want us to see them as symptoms of a larger malady, which doubtless accounts for the scene in which a wealthy woman idles in a tanning bed that looks like a coffin. The ostensibly comic images of the workers laboring at Lily’s palatial digs are presumably meant to say something, too, though their marginality here says less about their employers than it does about the filmmaker."

This puts someone in mind of those princely email swindles. It’s a pretty weak joke (made worse by the fact that Harold says an uncle of his made a fortune that way) and also an example of what passes for irony in “Gringo,” a new movie directed by Nash Edgerton from a screenplay by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone. Harold, you see, is a perfect sucker, an innocent whose trusting good nature makes him an easy target for grifters, scammers and liars.There are a lot of those in his life, including his wife, Bonnie (Thandie Newton), and his boss, Richard (Joel Edgerton, the director’s brother), a type-A blowhard who insists that Harold is his friend. Richard and Elaine (Charlize Theron), his predatory colleague-with-benefits, are planning a merger and are also involved in some off-the-books deals in Mexico having to do with medical and nonmedical marijuana. A business trip down there goes south in fairly predictable ways, at least in the context of the kind of hectic, strenuous, nasty caper-comedy “Gringo” aspires to be.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018Harold, as he wises up to the fact that he’s been played, takes matters into his own hands, faking a kidnapping and setting off a flurry of chasing, shouting, coitus interruptus and gunplay. A few familiar characters are summoned from the cliché repository and outfitted with a random quirk or two. The ruthless drug kingpin (Carlos Corona) is obsessed with the Beatles. The international mercenary (Sharlto Copley) is running a nonprofit in Haiti. The small-time hood (Harry Treadaway) dragging his clueless girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) into potential danger has a British accent. Harold, as we’ve established, is from Nigeria.He is also played by David Oyelowo, which turns out to be a mixed blessing. Mr. Oyelowo is without a doubt the best thing in “Gringo,” supplying the only grace notes in a cacophony of secondhand attitude and facetious overacting. But the deck is stacked against him, much as it is against Harold, who as the designated nice guy is assumed to be the least interesting person in the movie.The attention is lavished on his foils and tormentors, who are cut from gaudy, worn-out cardboard and set in motion like furious windup toys. Ms. Theron vamps and sneers, Joel Edgerton struts and blusters, and everyone works hard to sustain a mood of jokey, wised-up menace. It is possible to sit through it all without feeling completely miserable, and to remember a time when these comic-grotesque shenanigans might have seemed fresh. The mid-90s, roughly, when this kind of knockoff of early Tarantino, middle-period Coen brothers and jaunty Elmore Leonardism enjoyed something of a vogue. If you’re tempted by “Gringo,” you might be better off streaming something from that era.By the time the violence escalates from the amputation of a toe — happy birthday, “The Big Lebowski” — to gunshots to the head, “Gringo” has long since blown out its own meager brains. You keep rooting for Harold, of course, because he’s a decent fellow who has done nothing whatsoever to deserve any of this."

Ella (Ms. Mirren) plans to take John (Mr. Sutherland), an expert on Ernest Hemingway, to the Hemingway Home in Key West.John has symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, although that term is never used. And Ella, nursing her pain with a steady stream of whiskey, is clearly dying; the diagnosis will be obvious to viewers long before the film reveals it. “The Leisure Seeker” becomes a defense of their right to live their last days as they see fit — on the road instead of in nursing homes or hospitals.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018The sentiment is admirable; the execution decidedly is not. Part of the problem is that the screenwriters (four, including Mr. Virzì, share credit, working from a novel by Michael Zadoorian) treat the characters’ symptoms as plot devices — traits they can ignore or play up as each scene demands. (Some other Alzheimer’s films, like “Away From Her,” have done a better job of avoiding this trap.) When it’s time for a twist, John’s mind happens to be in the right year and place to share a secret.Neither ailment interferes with a host of cloying incidents, as when John drives off without Ella, forcing her to take a ride on a motorcycle to catch up. Or when the two experience a flat tire and are held up by a pair of young men. (Ella retrieves the shotgun she’s brought along, scaring them off, and John, who has already scolded one for ending a sentence with a preposition, tells them it’s not too late to take evening classes and turn their lives around.) In a mortifying sprinkling of topicality, the movie — set in summer 2016 — shows John, a lifelong Democratic voter, unwittingly joining in the chants at a rally for Donald Trump.The actors outclass this material by a Massachusetts-to-Florida distance, locating nuances and a sense of tenderness and intimacy. It’s hard to imagine other performers bringing so much to this setup. They give a true impression of two people who have spent their lives together and know how to talk each other. There is a movie to be made about John and Ella; it’s not one that ends with “Me and Bobby McGee” over the credits."

The talented Mr. Bana returns to the brutish-but-bright mode of his 2001 breakthrough film “Chopper.” When the movie can stay out of its own way, it delivers some powerful scenes, including one in which Blomfeld faces down a would-be assassin (Nandiphile Mbeshu, superb) in a prison shower room. But beyond that, the movie offers conventional gratifications and no surprises."

Though both are underemployed actors, Renato is clearly the more theatrical of the two: Fond of declamatory monologues and carefully calibrated gestures, he’s a man who seeks the light as instinctively as any newly liberated soul.With passions dwindling and careers stalled, the men gratefully accept lead roles in a film about Lola and Ana, a pair of aging cross-dressers and former drag artists. Renato, however, finds the characters grotesque; and as he works to overcome his prejudices — mainly through speechifying and pensive stares — Mr. Letelier (who wrote the story with Victoria Wharfe McIntyre) takes direct aim at his country’s repressive and homophobic history. In the film-within-the-film, effigies of fascist, religious and Communist leaders hang on Lola and Ana’s wall, silent reminders of violence and fear.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 27, 2018Small and stagy and claustrophobic, “Shining Moon” is visually rough yet oddly enticing in its experimental awkwardness. Familiar snippets of classical music float through scenes like one of Lola’s peignoirs, and lines of poetry (written by Mr. Letelier) dangle in the air. At times gently comic — though no one would mistake it for a Chilean version of the British television sitcom “Vicious” — the movie is, among other things, about adjusting to the present by confronting the past. And accepting that sometimes, being fabulous is more than enough."

His wife, Toby Perlman — a sunny, empathetic presence — is with him, and there’s a shovel for clearing impassable intersections.Aside from frank views of his crutches and leg braces (childhood polio left him disabled), and a mention of early rejections because of his handicap, the film glides lightly and uncritically along the surface of a life. We get a brief dip into his family’s past and emigration from Israel, but the filmmaker never digs deeply enough to reveal any other substantial dimension of this man, or her theories about what shaped him."

I suspect some variant of this experience is common among readers who grew up any time since 1962, when Madeleine L’Engle’s beloved science-fiction coming-of-age novel was first published.The movie adaptation, directed by Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell, has been a long time coming, and it arrives in theaters buoyed by and burdened with expectations. It is the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman, and the diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm. This is how movies should look from now on, which is to say how they should have looked all along. Fans of the book and admirers of Ms. DuVernay’s work — I include myself in both groups — can breathe a sigh of relief, and some may also find that their breath has been taken away.Mine was, once or twice, though I would describe the overall experience as satisfaction rather than awe. “A Wrinkle in Time,” faithful to the affirmative, democratic intelligence of the book, is also committed to serving its most loyal and susceptible audience. This is, unapologetically, a children’s movie, by turns gentle, thrilling and didactic, but missing the extra dimension of terror and wonder that would have transcended the genre. Thankfully, though, Ms. DuVernay has dispensed with the winking and cutesiness that are Hollywood’s preferred ways of pandering and condescending to grown-ups. The best way to appreciate what she has done is in the company of a curious and eager 10-year-old (as I was fortunate enough to do). Or, if you’re really lucky, to locate that innocent, skeptical, openhearted version of yourself.VideoThe director Ava DuVernay narrates a sequence from her film featuring Storm Reid, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling.Published OnMarch 8, 2018CreditCreditWalt Disney PicturesThe story comes with a heroine who makes such identification easy. Meg Murry is a smart, hurt and very real-seeming middle school student played with wonderful solemnity by Storm Reid. Meg’s father (Chris Pine), a brilliant and ambitious scientist, has disappeared, leaving behind Meg; her brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe); and their mother (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who is also a brilliant and ambitious scientist.The parental partnership, an intellectual romance and a romance between intellectuals, is conveyed with graceful efficiency in the first part of the movie, which also sketches Meg’s predicament. As she grieves for her father and wonders where he went, she also contends with the usual early adolescent afflictions and anxieties. Her grades are slumping, her classmates tease her, and neither the principal (André Holland) nor her mother seem to understand what she is going through.The frustrations and injustices of youth can feel as vast as the cosmos. In Meg’s case, they literally are. Her father didn’t just run off, he “tessered,” slipping into a distant part of the universe to prove a hypothesis about space, time and consciousness that he and his wife had developed together. Now he is lost, and everything is threatened by a malevolent force known as the IT (not to be confused with the malevolent force in the movie “It”), which lives on a planet called Camazotz.ImageOprah Winfrey as Mrs. Which.CreditAtsushi Nishijima/DisneyTesser, by the way is the verb form of “tesseract,” a phenomenon rendered more poetically by the movie’s title. That and a good deal more is explained by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, three astrophysical principles who take the earthly forms of Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and a literally bigger-than-life Oprah Winfrey. Mrs. Whatsit is a flame-haired, slightly scatterbrained chatterbox. Mrs. Who is an edition of Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations come to life, offering wisdom gleaned from the likes of Rumi, Shakespeare and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Mrs. Which offers her own brand of affirmation, guidance and tough love, encouraging Meg to find and become her best self and to be a warrior for good against the forces of darkness. In other words: Oprah Winfrey. With glittering makeup and shimmering armor.The special effects are pretty wild, though not always as overpowering as the gasps and exclamations of the characters might indicate. The flying flowers on the planet Uriel are sublime, the spectacle of Ms. Witherspoon transformed into an airborne cabbage less so. In any case, Meg and Charles Wallace, accompanied by a sweet boy named Calvin (Levi Miller), who has a crush on Meg, tesser off in search of their dad, finding picturesque planets and Zach Galifianakis as a grumpy guru called the Happy Medium. It’s fairly mellow fun until the Mrses take their leave and the youngsters must face the terrors of Camazotz and the IT on their own.ImageMs. Reid and Levi Miller.CreditAtsushi Nishijima/DisneyAt this point, the images become sharper, scarier and more austere, and the emotions more intense. The warmth that is Ms. DuVernay’s calling card encounters a Kubrickian chill as the power of the IT starts to mess around with Meg’s mind and Charles Wallace’s personality. The worst part of the adventure is the best part of the movie, and it’s over a little too soon.Like Mrs. Which and her colleagues, “A Wrinkle in Time” is demonstratively generous, encouraging and large-spirited. Though it is full of bright colors and passages of visual dazzle, it trusts words more than images, spelling out messages about love, courage and self-acceptance with the conscientious care of a teacher reading aloud to a class. (It also makes canny use of music, both Ramin Djawadi’s score and songs from of-the-moment pop and hip-hop artists.) Nobody will miss the lessons of the movie, and they are fine and timely lessons. Those who take them most to heart will find their way back to Madeleine L’Engle."

And why not?Russian spies are apparently everywhere, and we seem to be in the middle of the Cold War 2.0. Anyone who has ever watched a ballet also knows how terrifyingly capable dancers are, with their steely strength, athleticism and discipline. Ms. Lawrence, best known as the teenage survivalist turned savior Katniss Everdeen in the “Hunger Games” series, has played rough before, so when her character in “Red Sparrow” brutally twists in a knife, it’s almost like old home week.The story, too, is familiar but has notes and beats that have been refurbished and scrambled enough to hold and at times surprise you. Ms. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a prima ballerina for the Bolshoi. Her face framed by bangs and a curtain of waist-skimming hair, Dominika rules the stage until a midperformance catastrophe cuts her down. With an ailing mother (Joely Richardson) and no money or options, she turns to her uncle, amusingly named Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts, sliming up his sex appeal), a power monger in the foreign intelligence service who makes her an unsavory offer. She’s to serve as a honey pot for a man of interest, a job that of course goes wrong.VideoFrancis Lawrence narrates a sequence from the film featuring Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton.Published OnMarch 1, 2018CreditCreditMurray Close/20th Century FoxThe director Francis Lawrence (no relation to Ms. Lawrence) paints the movie red quickly and lavishly, daubing and washing that color onto sets, costumes and pouty lips. By the time he stages the first murder, the blood has begun to flow liberally, as if to underscore the movie’s title. The scene makes for a gruesome tableau, especially because of its intimacy (death often comes in close-up here), and because of the blood that splatters across Dominika, an augury of the lurid, messy violence to come. And come it does — in dribbles, gushes and an occasional shot to the head. “Red Sparrow” is based on the novel (the first in a trilogy) of the same title by Jason Matthews, a former C.I.A. officer who presumably knows something about the death-dealing world of spy versus spy.The C.I.A. digs the novel and posted a review on its website, which suggests it would also approve of the movie’s politics (United States good, Russia bad); humorously, the agency did warn that the sex was explicit and “the Russian characters are not as nuanced as their U.S. counterparts.” (The violence onscreen is, as with most mainstream movies, blunter and more attentively staged and filmed than the sex, which is ho-hum decorous.) The Russians are about as movie-real as the American characters, which mostly just means that they’re types fleshed out with recognizably human detailing and all the polished professionalism — and the slight, detached irony — that comes when you hire smooth veterans like Charlotte Rampling, Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds.They’re welcome company, as is the rest of a cast that includes Joel Edgerton as Nate, a C.I.A. operative in Russia whose cover is blown soon after the movie opens. He’s working with a Russian intelligence insider called Marble, a meaty bone that the Americans are gnawing on. (Nate’s colleagues include a roundup of yammering, evidently spineless bosses in the States and a few colleagues in the field played by Sakina Jaffrey and Bill Camp with stern faces and wit.) While Nate takes care of American business, Dominika is forced deeper into the Russian intelligence apparatus, a two-track narrative that finds him fighting for credibility while she trains to become a Motherland prostitute.Dominika’s part of a cohort that is decorously called sparrows, though she speaks angry truth to power when she accuses her uncle of sending her to “whore school.” Filled with pretty young things — all equally exploitable women and men — this is a suitably grim academy supervised by a severe matron who could be the daughter of Rosa Klebb, one of James Bond’s most memorable adversaries. A diminutive operative with a knife in her shoe, Klebb (an indelibly ferocious Lotte Lenya) appears in the Cold War-era film “From Russia With Love.” Part of what’s both queasily provocative and instructive about “Red Sparrow” is that while Dominika might have been a Bond Girl in an earlier time (or, really, just in the next flick), here she’s allowed to go full-on Klebb.ImageMatthias Schoenaerts and Ms. Lawrence; Mr. Schoenaerts plays Ms. Lawrence’s uncle — uncle Vanya, no less — who makes her an unsavory proposition.CreditMurray Close/20th Century FoxUnlike in Bond movies, though, there are few self-aware winks in “Red Sparrow.” Working from Justin Haythe’s script, Mr. Lawrence folds in moments of levity (a delectably acid and funny Mary-Louise Parker stirs things up), but “Red Sparrow” mostly hews closer in grim vibe and viciousness to Bourne than to Bond. And, in classic fashion, Dominika endures the extremes of punishment — penance that centers on her pulverized, near-martyred body — that often come with heroic journeys. The rawness of the violence is startling, partly because despite “Atomic Blonde” and other female-driven movies, it’s still unusual to see a woman receive (and freely mete out) such barbarity.That may not be everyone’s idea of progress, but it’s both appealing and crucial that “Red Sparrow” doesn’t soft sell Dominika. There’s an attractive, recognizable toughness to her as well as a febrile intensity born from need and circumstances, including the existential reality of being a woman in a man’s world. Dominika is sentimental (mostly about her mother), but she isn’t sentimentalized and never becomes the movie’s virgin or its whore, its femme fatale or good girl. She’s just the one carrying the fast-track story. And when Dominika becomes involved with Nate, it’s because, well, that’s how the roles were written. Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Edgerton never manage to spark, but it scarcely matters; their characters are too busy to seriously moon over each other.As she does, Ms. Lawrence goes all in, seamlessly meeting the movie’s physical demands — whether she’s dancing onstage or crawling in blood — while turning Dominika into a character who grows more real with each unreal scene. She worked with Mr. Lawrence on three “Hunger Games” movies, and this shared history probably smoothed some of the story’s edges, and may also explain why “Red Sparrow” moves so fluidly even as the story nuttily kinks and bounces around locations.It helps that Ms. Lawrence, like all great stars, can slip into a role as if sliding into another skin, unburdened by hesitation or self-doubt. Craft and charm are part of what she brings to this role, as well as a serviceable accent, but it’s her absolute ease and certainty that carry you through “Red Sparrow.” She was born to screen stardom, and it’s a blast to see where it’s taking her."

Yet timing isn’t the only reason the new “Death Wish,” a so-called reimagining of Michael Winner’s 1974 thriller of the same name, is an imbecilic misfire.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018The imaginations in question belong to the director Eli Roth and the writer Joe Carnahan, who move the action from New York City to Chicago, where Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis, in the role originated by Charles Bronson) is a trauma surgeon. The narrative remains roughly the same: When violent attackers murder Paul’s wife and leave his daughter comatose, he buys a gun — and a contraption for the home hilariously termed “tactical furniture” — dons a hoodie and starts hunting down the perpetrators.Reveling in urban paranoia, the filmmakers present Paul as a locked-and-loaded hero in a city where weary detectives point to a wall plastered with unsolved cases and a radio jock — in a tone typically reserved for describing home runs — announces 48 murders in a single weekend. Yet where the original film (based on Brian Garfield’s 1972 anti-vigilantism novel) was a brutal psychological study of a bereaved man using random violence almost as a form of therapy, the tone here veers from rah-rah to jokey. Mr. Roth, whose 2005 shocker, “Hostel,” took a shrewdly offensive swipe at First World arrogance, may lack Mr. Winner’s viselike grip on action scenes, but he can do better than give us dopey dialogue and vending-machine villains.Morally unconflicted about its self-taught shooter, “Death Wish” promotes a vision of a city whose streets run red and whose residents run scared. It’s ready-made for an N.R.A. ad campaign."

We’re meant to think it’s a close-up of a glass of Champagne, but it’s just an antacid tablet dissolving in water, introducing viewers to the quiet life of Liliane, played by Ms. Huppert.She has an unglamorous job in the garnish department of a pâté factory, reads the feminist author Marilyn French on the bus ride home and watches quiz shows in her passable but plain apartment. But she has a past, as a young man who becomes a colleague discovers.Years before, under the name Laura, she sang for France in a Eurovision song contest. A request from the colleague, Jean (Kévin Azaïs), to sing at a celebration for his father’s cycling club, leads to both romance and a return to the stage. (And Ms. Huppert can sing, albeit in a narrow, understated range that’s more reminiscent of Astrud Gilberto’s “The Girl From Ipanema” than the ABBA-evoking chanteuse her character is reputed to have been.)Her comeback yields, yes, a life of Champagne instead of antacid. The story is as predictable as they come, played out at such a low emotional temperature as to be practically ignorable. Which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if it offered something else worth paying attention to. Something else besides the endlessly watchable lead actress, that is."

Keith (William Jackson Harper) and Jessica (Rebecca Henderson) have been sent by their company to a remote pocket of woodland on some sort of biological study, but the animals are acting strangely. The location was also the site of a massacre by a cult that sounds like a cross between the Peoples Temple and the Manson family.Inevitably, the surveillance cameras will malfunction, stories of troubled past teams will be shared and strange voices and hallucinations will enter the picture. (There are too many only-a-dream fakeouts.) “They Remain” is less interesting for its familiar ideas than its lo-fi craft. Mr. Gelatt uses negative space to emphasize Jessica and Keith’s isolation from each other and plays games with perspective, inviting speculation about Jessica’s offscreen actions.Productive ambiguity can tip into unrealized potential, and “They Remain” ultimately leans too heavily on vagueness as a crutch.

Judging from the film, the main setbacks he encountered were his team’s crushing loss to France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup (the subject of national hand-wringing in New Zealand, but not an incident whose emotional impact travels) and playing with a broken foot during the World Cup in 2011. “Chasing Great” makes that look easy.Too little time is spent on strategy, Mr. McCaw’s style of captaining or his apparent skill for tiptoeing up to the edge of the rules. We do learn about his habit of writing notes to himself before a game (be “calm, clear and decisive,” “enjoy,” “just play”) and the pressure he felt to go out with a win. But even fans, the only conceivable audience here, already know how that turned out."

Instead, it flashes repeatedly in and out of three distinct timelines in which Sidney (played throughout by Logan Lerman) is first a precociously talented teenager, then a celebrated but imploding novelist married to his high school sweetheart (Elle Fanning) and last a hirsute hobo living off the grid.Between these periods lies a world of hurt that includes suicide, sexual abuse and probable brain damage, all of it barely teased until a walloping final reveal — a dump of distress that feels wholly unearned. Characters are sketched instead of developed, the looping structure blurring some (most egregiously, Blake Jenner’s critical role as a troubled jock and Margaret Qualley’s blink-and-you-miss-it turn as a melting-down mistress) and eliding others.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018Only Kyle Chandler, who could inject authenticity into the most ludicrous character, escapes unscathed. Playing a mysterious stranger who’s doggedly investigating Sidney’s third-act disappearance, Mr. Chandler weaves a thread of stability around a disastrously fragmented plot. Yet his character’s devotion to Sidney’s redemption feels entirely undeserved. Introduced while smugly declaiming his masturbatory fantasies to his high school English class, Sidney is barely bearable.

After some harrowing video footage in which Mr. Hondros finishes a phone call while crouching for cover around the corner from a fire fight, the movie cuts to an archival interview with Mr. Hondros, who died in Libya in 2011. Likable and articulate, the photographer responds to a question about war photographers being “the craziest” of journalists: “The problem with war photography is there’s absolutely no way to do it from a distance. You have to be close.”VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 22, 2018In Iraq, Liberia, Libya and elsewhere, Mr. Hondros got very close, during conflicts in which old rules of engagement were eroding. The movie is at its best telling discrete stories of Mr. Hondros’s excursions. In Tal Afar, Iraq, in 2005, American soldiers opened fire on a car approaching a checkpoint and wound up orphaning two Iraqi children whose continued stories the film tells. Mr. Hondros’s pictures of the traumatized children are some of the most famed images from that war zone.The filmmakers visit Samar Hassan, the little girl featured in the Hondros photograph from Tal Afar, now a teenager. She is eloquent in her rage at those responsible for her parents’ death. The interview scene is impressive for that reason. But the movie has already claimed that Samar’s brother Rakan was targeted and killed because of the exposure he received in Western media. It made this viewer a little queasy, then, to see the filmmakers bring Samar into their lens. If the movie doesn’t go more than skin deep in interrogating questions about interventions both military and journalistic into the Middle East, it does succeed in opening up Mr. Hondros’s contradiction-filled world."

And when the near-fatal collision kicks loose a cascade of poor decisions and worse outcomes, the couple’s increasingly violent behavior blooms as much from hidden resentments as visible threats.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018Such is the premise of Julius Ramsay’s first feature, “Midnighters,” a twisty thriller with horror-movie flourishes. Inspired by a 2002 article in The Los Angeles Times, the story (by the director’s brother Alston Ramsay, a former speechwriter who worked for the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama) swerves and double-clutches with daunting speed. When the accident victim turns out to have the couple’s address in his pocket and a shady connection to Lindsey’s freeloading younger sister, Hannah (Perla Haney-Jardine), a scary situation turns terrifying.As tables turn and turn again — nudged along by a wolfish impostor (Ward Horton) and some creative torturing — the movie allows scant time to ponder each new tack. Jeff and Lindsey’s marriage feels long past its sell-by date, and Hannah’s culpability in their predicament is only hazily defined. But if the action sometimes feels rushed, the director of photography, Alexander Alexandrov, maximizes his small budget and dimly lighted New England locations.

As the ruthless mayor, Jacki Weaver is a weaponized Martha Stewart, masking the stink of mining-corporation corruption with the aroma of home-baked apple pies. Over at the local pleasure palace, Cheng Pei Pei is squeezed into the much smaller role of town madam.“The world was not made for you,” she admonishes one of her unhappy Chinese charges. “You were made for it.” It’s a sentiment that Jay Swan (Aaron Pedersen), a perpetually sozzled Aboriginal detective, can appreciate. Distrusted by whites and blacks alike, he exhibits all the tics and trappings of the alienated loner, including a ratty trailer and a mistrust of personal hygiene. His uneasy alliance with Josh (Alex Russell), a morally conflicted white police officer, is the movie’s thematic heart. Yet its sociopolitical concerns — primarily around indigenous land rights — are muted and muddled by a script that favors manly grunting and moody looks over clarifying dialogue.Riven with racism and sharp bursts of violence, “Goldstone” nevertheless has a rough, desolate beauty. Gorgeous aerial shots reveal a blasted and burnished expanse, as if all of the town’s precious metal — unlike its crimes — lay nakedly, dazzlingly exposed."

It’s a near-minor miracle that just about everything works in this emphatically modest comedy-drama, which draws on squishy types and themes — the lonely eccentric, the cross-cultural clash, the revelatory trip — that can quickly sink less nimble features. The writer-director Atsuko Hirayanagi isn’t selling a packaged idea about what it means to be human; she does something trickier and more honest here, merely by tracing the ordinary absurdities and agonies of one woman’s life.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018She has a terrific partner in cinema with Shinobu Terajima, who plays Setsuko, our irresistibly flawed heroine. You first see Setsuko on a crowded train platform, a gray speck in a quiet sea of people, many wearing white surgical masks. She’s staring ahead as if lost in thought (or maybe simply lost), when a man brushes past her and jumps in front of the coming train. There’s a pause, the expected gasps and a discreet shot of the victim. Then Setsuko goes off to another day of work, a day like any other except that now she’s deep in a story about identity, self-annihilation and stubborn existence.These come into play in a contrived, borderline cutesy setup that — once the parts have been snapped into place — relaxes into a pleasurable, meandering portrait of someone getting another shot, maybe the last one, at happiness. Things start clicking when Setsuko’s niece (Shioli Kutsuna) persuades her reluctant aunt to take English-language lessons with an American, John, played by a sweet, sympathetic Josh Hartnett. (The great Koji Yakusho plays another student.) John seems laughably ill-equipped for the job; his dubious pedagogical method includes fake names and hairpieces. But after giving her a curly blond wig and a lingering hug, he inadvertently transforms Setsuko into Lucy, igniting a revolution of self.Ms. Hirayanagi sketches in Setsuko’s life with unfussy pointillist realism. An office worker with no apparent friends and few relatives, Setsuko doesn’t need a reason or even a frown to look unhappy. She doesn’t stand out in a cluttered office that’s a horror show of smiling obsequiousness and barely hidden contempt; she scarcely rates a genuine hello or a shred of interest. Soon after the story opens, she attends a retirement party for an older woman who’s being put out to pasture with an ugly bouquet and a grotesque stuffed animal. When the retiring woman starts bawling, Setsuko flashes a smile, tightly baring her teeth in what seems like an invitation for us to judge her.ImageEnglish class: from left, Koji Yakusho, Josh Hartnett and Ms. Terajima.CreditFilm MovementIt’s a small land mine of a scene — it would be easy to turn against Setsuko right then — but Ms. Hirayanagi proves distinctly adept at shifting tones. She’s also a fast worker, and she quickly navigates through the story’s trickier, more emotionally precarious moments without seeming to rush through or away from them. The woman’s weeping may be sad, at least given the circumstances, office decorum and social norms. But her galumphing howls also sound funny, too loud, faintly ridiculous, performative and self-flattering. Setsuko may be mean, but in a movie that is very much concerned with identity and the roles that we assume and reject, it’s clear that she isn’t entirely unjustified.At first, Ms. Terajima’s subtle performance works like a roadblock to easy sympathy. With her defeated shoulders and practiced deadpan, Setsuko seems to be a passive observer, someone who has become good at watching other people live. She isn’t at all likable and it isn’t clear, at least initially, if she’s even worthy of sustained interest. When she hunkers down smoking in her tiny, uncomfortably cluttered apartment — a killing field of empty cans, miscellaneous junk and aspirational fashion goods — it looks as if she’s living in the aftermath of a disaster of her own making. A lot of actors can weep on cue, but it takes one as good as Ms. Terajima to make emptiness feel haunted.Together with her director, Ms. Terajima fills up that emptiness with deep, then deeper waves of feeling, and escalating, freewheeling comedy. After some narrative busywork, John disappears and Setsuko — weighted down with a large suitcase and her comically, aggressively angry sister (Kaho Minami) — follows him to Southern California. There, amid the sunshine and enveloping shadows, Setsuko finds and then loses herself while cutting loose and engaging in some savage psychological blood sport. She stumbles and she falls, plays at being Lucy and slips back into a radically changed Setsuko in a movie in which the human comedy is by turns tender, plaintive, heartfelt and joyful."

Even though it’s based on a book published 18 years ago, and draws inspiration from a film from 1930 (itself based on a 1905 novel), the timeliness of this movie, written and directed by Richard Levine, might strike you as downright unnerving.A middle-aged writer teaching at a liberal-arts college has sex with a student and is engulfed in a scandal that wrecks his marriage and his career. Is he villain or victim? Another predatory monster or a martyr to cultural sensitivities run amok? Is the way his story is told evidence of an anti-feminist backlash or a bold indictment of witch-hunting excess?As if in anticipation of heated, pre-hashtagged answers to these questions, Francine Prose, whose book “Blue Angel” is Mr. Levine’s source, recently published an essay in The Paris Review inviting viewers to concentrate on the specificity and complexity of the story rather than looking for an easy argument. That is good advice, though it may prove hard to follow, at least if you concentrate on the obvious themes of sex and power. But there is more to this chronicle of campus misbehavior than he said/she said, and more humor than indignation in the telling. At its best — which is to say when it follows the sharp angles and sly nuances of Ms. Prose’s prose most closely — “Submission” is less an erotic melodrama than a comedy of literary manners.The narrator is Ted Swenson (Stanley Tucci), the success of whose first book earned him a teaching job, a temporary gig that has lasted more than a decade. His wife, Sherrie (Kyra Sedgwick), works at the student health service. They have a grown daughter (Colby Minifie) who is not her father’s biggest fan. That status is claimed by Angela Argo (Addison Timlin), an undergraduate in Ted’s fiction workshop who asks him to take a look at a novel she is writing.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 22, 2018What happens next is tawdry, predictable, queasy-making and also frequently funny, though not for the Swensons. Mr. Tucci is the most unflappable of actors, which makes Ted’s inevitable and dramatic flapping all the more terrible and amusing to witness. He is a charming guy, to be sure, but also smug and self-pitying. Whether or not he entirely deserves what he eventually gets, his complacency and passivity set him up for a fall.But “Submission” isn’t just his story. Angela is in many ways more interesting, even though, at the end, her motives are flattened in the interest of a narrative payoff. Ted is taken with her writing, and also with her naïve, admiring eagerness for his approval. She writes about sex with older men, in her novel and in an earlier book of poems, in a way that seems calculated to trigger inappropriate fantasies in the mind of a creatively frustrated, self-consciously aging teacher marooned in academia.Ted is an easy mark, and hardly an unwilling participant in his own ruin. He is less pathetic than the professor played by Emil Jannings in Josef von Sternberg’s “The Blue Angel” (which serves as both a model for “Submission” and point of reference within it), and Angela is hardly a siren in the mold of Marlene Dietrich’s cabaret singer. But Angela does turn out to be amoral, manipulative and dishonest, traits that make her both a caricature of feminine guile and a promising fiction writer — perhaps more fully committed to the art than her vain, bumbling teacher.Unfortunately, Mr. Levine, directing his second feature after working mainly in television (on “Masters of Sex” and “Nip/Tuck,” among other series), is a lesser artist than Ms. Prose. “Submission” feels more like an act of devotion, or perhaps of submission, than a free-standing adaptation. The satire is cautious and the emotions restrained, so that what should be a swirl of lust, ambition, recrimination and bureaucratic absurdity rises only to genteel, nervous laughter and mild discomfort. The actors all do their best — Ms. Timlin manages the difficult trick of switching back and forth between innocence and its opposite — but a crucial element of intensity is missing. By the end, the stakes seem trivial, even though families and livelihoods are in play and big ideas hover in the background.Can a movie be provocatively timid? Clumsy and coy at the same time? The more you think about “Submission,” the less relevant it looks. Which may represent a pyrrhic kind of vindication. There’s nothing here that’s really worth arguing about."

This holds for “Werewolf,” a Canadian film written and directed by Ashley McKenzie. But the particulars of Ms. McKenzie’s approach, and the excellent work of her lead actors, bring new value to the mode.Andrew Gillis and Bhreagh MacNeil play Blaise and Vanessa, two addicts on a methadone program. Young, dirt-poor and without any significant options for moving their lives forward, they trudge around the small town they’re stuck in, dragging a lawn mower with them. Entrepreneurship, such as it is, subsists in their offering to cut neighborhood lawns for money. And of course, eventually the lawn mower breaks.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018Ms. McKenzie keeps her camera close to her characters, with shots that are meticulously framed without being precious about it. Generally, the camera moves with the characters when it moves at all, and the film’s cutting is clean. (Ms. McKenzie edited the film; the cinematography is by Scott Moore.)The movie has a quietly startling moment breaking out of its style, in a scene in which Blaise, back to getting high, experiences a hallucination while a friend plays video games. The performers don’t seem like they’re acting at all, which contributes to the film’s unsettling power. The elliptical narrative structure articulates a sad truth of the addict’s life concerning both the challenge and the tedium of making it through to the next fix."

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 20, 2018CreditCreditGrasshopper FilmThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson’s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.“Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann’s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Monáe’s “Hell You Talmbout” and Phil Ochs’s “William Moore.”That song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film’s title and a part of its wider cultural context. “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director’s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.ImageMr. Wilkerson’s documentary is passionately political.CreditGrasshopper FilmMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include “An Injury to One” and “Far From Afghanistan,” dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from “To Kill a Mockingbird” provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck’s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.Instead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn’t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather’s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, “Southern secessionist” group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.The bitterness of “Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” is hard to swallow, but also bracing, like a shot of strong liquor that leaves you with a clearer head and sharper senses. The movie is an antidote to the lethal innocence that, as Baldwin and others have pointed out, allows the crimes of racism to remain unpunished and often unacknowledged."

Based on interviews with Mexican and Central American migrants, the experience dropped participants in the Sonoran Desert at night — and then subjected them to a violent raid by American patrols.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 14, 2018The antidote to that sensationalist exercise is the fascinating experimental documentary “El Mar La Mar,” which also concerns migration in the Sonoran Desert and screens at MoMA from Friday through March 1. But instead of offering a short burst of terror followed by the prospect of a quick escape, this immersive, sensorially complex movie evokes the terrifying disorientation and loneliness of migration: the eerie sounds of sand crunching underfoot; the surreal sights of jugs of water left by well-wishers; fragments of voices heard over radio transmissions.Told in three movements, the second being the longest and least cryptic, the film is the work of J.P. Sniadecki (a veteran of Harvard’s Sensory Ethnography Lab) and Joshua Bonnetta, who are as concerned with the possibilities of the film medium as they are with this particular subject. The human presence is largely limited to voice-over testimonies. A resident talks about taking in a shivering young man. We hear of migrants’ experiences with getting lost. A woman recalls discovering a body.The result is simultaneously elusive and concrete: abstract cinema that packs a punch."

Marx (August Diehl), a scruffy journalist, and his sidekick Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske), a renegade rich kid, meet in Cologne, Germany, in 1844 and overcome some initial wariness by bonding over their shared contempt for the Young Hegelians. (Man, those guys are lame.) They set out to write a “Critique of Critical Criticism,” and when it’s published (as “The Holy Family”), it’s something of a hit. By the time the revolutions of 1848 are ready to happen, Marx and Engels are the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the European left, rock stars for an age of revolution.Scrupulously faithful to the biographical record, “The Young Karl Marx,” directed by Raoul Peck (from a script he wrote with Pascal Bonitzer), is both intellectually serious and engagingly free-spirited. The founders of Communism, full of intensity and ambition and sporting contrasting beards, look and act like pioneers of brocialism. They spend some drunken evenings hashing out the labor theory of value — Engels holds his liquor better than Marx — and many hours, together and separately, in furious paroxysms of thought.Thinking notoriously resists being captured on film, and Mr. Peck often falls back on its most common analogues, scribbling and smoking. Marx in particular does a lot of those things. But Mr. Diehl’s performance is a marvel of itchy intelligence, and it strips away almost all of the character’s accumulated importance. “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living,” a slightly older Marx wrote, and what is most remarkable, indeed most exciting, about “The Young Marx” is how lightly that burden rests upon it.Mr. Peck’s earlier features include “Lumumba,” a scripted biography of the Congolese leader, and “I am Not Your Negro,” a documentary drawn from the work of James Baldwin. (His résumé also includes a stint as Haiti’s minister of culture.) While in form and style the new movie is a fairly straightforward biopic, it is also fundamentally the portrait of a writer, a man of letters grappling with both the mundane and the lofty demands of his vocation.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 13, 2018Until his partnership with Engels is solidified — and access to some of the Engels’s family wealth is secured — Marx struggles with deadlines, antagonizes editors and lives in bohemian penury with his wife, Jenny (Vicky Krieps), and their infant daughter. The family is harassed by bill collectors and also by the police, bouncing from Cologne to Paris to Brussels as Marx’s political agitation brands him a dangerous subversive.He is also embroiled in a series of volatile alliances with eminent figures of the European left, notably Wilhelm Weitling (Alexander Scheer), a bombastic orator whose ideas sound vaporous at best, and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (the marvelous Olivier Gourmet), a good-natured philosopher who seems to be the hardest-working anarchist in show business. Those names are fairly obscure today, while Marx’s is still attached to an -ism, however battered. (Does that count as a spoiler?) He and Engels stage both a theoretical and an organizational coup, replacing utopian nostrums about the brotherhood of man with a doctrine of conflict between the proletarian and the bourgeoisie. The rest is history, bloody and contentious and not yet finished.Marx and Engels’s takeover of a stodgy workers’-rights group called the League of the Just is a premonition of the tactical ruthlessness that would become characteristic of Communist parties in the 20th century. To put it in the language of 21st-century capitalism, the founders of Communism are disrupters and innovators, in possession of the entrepreneurial doggedness and the self-righteous zeal required to bend the world to their will.“The Young Karl Marx” is a highly individualized picture of the authors of a doctrine of collective struggle. This contradiction (to revert to Marxist vocabulary) is precisely what energizes the film and rescues it from the twin dangers of tedium and sentimentality. There are other knots of irony and dialectical difficulty, notably with respect to the status of women within the global program of emancipation the two dudes so grandly envision.Jenny Marx is a rebellious Prussian aristocrat; Engels’s wife, Mary Burns (Hannah Steele), is a rebellious Irish factory worker. The two women provide a degree of centrifugal energy, pulling the story away from politics toward matters of the heart and hearth. But they also, for exactly that reason, expose gaps in their husbands’ emerging theory of inequality and exploitation. Jenny and Mary support Karl and Friedrich’s work wholeheartedly, but also within the parameters of a division of labor that seems beyond the reach of their politics. They clear the dishes, tend the children, hand out fliers and hang banners — part of the history but also at its margins.I’m not suggesting that this is a lapse on Mr. Peck’s part. On the contrary, the way his film deals with family matters and gender relations is an aspect of its precision and a measure of its insight. The great virtue of “The Young Karl Marx” is its clarity, its ability to perceive the way the eddies of personal experience flow within the wider stream of history."

It’s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin’s script, the director Brian O’Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 13, 2018Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins’ birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O’Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it’s a measure of this movie’s insistently fright-free storytelling that they’re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner’s Edward. He’s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 “Dracula,” as the family’s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit."

Set in a future that looks pretty much like today, it centers on a biologist, Lena (Natalie Portman), who shortly after the movie opens reunites with her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), who she thought was dead. As he sits in their kitchen, the camera slinking about, Lena’s surprise gives way to happiness and then to mounting wariness that, like some kind of contagion, soon slithers under your skin. To understand what has happened and why, Lena sets off on a heroic journey, one that — like most such adventures — inevitably leads inward with each searching step.The setup turns on one of those alien mysteries (an extraterrestrial or a monolith or floating spaceships) that have come to Earth to wreak havoc or hatch conspiracies and force humans to make bad choices. The foreign body here takes the form of what’s called the shimmer: a glistening, ever-growing force field that has descended on a swath of Florida marshland like an opalescent shower curtain. The shimmer’s whirling pinky purples and blues evoke the rainbow colors you see in oily patches on a road after it rains, which suggests there’s something toxic about its beauty. The rainbow can’t help but also evoke the adventurous Dorothy, another traveler to a strange land.Lena heads off on her own far-out trip soon after arriving at a government bunker at the edge of the shimmer. There, anonymous types scurry around or stare into computers; some carry guns, others clipboards; still others wear Hazmat suits. After a banging start — an inquisition, a homecoming — the writer-director Alex Garland fumbles putting these pieces in place. He rolls out the introductions, drops a little mumbo jumbo and some data points (mostly from Dr. Ventress, a shrink played by the perfectly chilled Jennifer Jason Leigh); he also engages in too much narrative throat clearing. Finally, Lena and four other armed women pass into the shimmer, which is where the story gets its weird on.VideoAlex Garland narrates a scene from his film featuring Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Published OnFeb. 22, 2018CreditCreditParamount PicturesMr. Garland has a talent for unnerving you with quietly dissonant notes and an occasional grotesque flourish. A novelist and screenwriter, he made a terrific directorial debut with “Ex Machina” (2015), a creep-out set at the intersection of human hubris and artificial intelligence. An intuitive filmmaker, Mr. Garland created that movie’s wholly believable world as much through the visual and sound design as through the scripted beats and lines. He’s a genre guy, and while he enjoys unleashing blunt horror-film scares, he’s especially good at creating a sense of intimate menace, the kind that can brusquely change vibes and temperatures, and just as quickly turn characters into antagonists.The world that Mr. Garland has created in “Annihilation” is larger than that of “Ex-Machina,” more complex and intricately detailed. Working once more with the production designer Mark Digby, Mr. Garland again turns interior spaces into emblems of isolation and desolation. (Here, rooms often seem emptiest when they’re inhabited, partly because of how Mr. Garland visually isolates characters in the frame.) The greater, more richly suggestive realm in “Annihilation,” though, is the natural world inside the shimmer, a dense, verdant biosphere filled with animals and plants that are at once familiar and — with their extra bits and trippy hues — pleasurably, at times spookily, foreign.“Annihilation” is based on the first book in Jeff VanderMeer’s “Southern Reach Trilogy, but it also seems to owe a considered debt to the ancient myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In Virgil’s telling, Orpheus journeys to the underworld in an attempt to retrieve his adored wife, Eurydice, who has died from a snake bite. Ovid revisited the myth in “Metamorphoses” and centuries later Jean Cocteau put a modern spin on it in “Orpheus” (1950), a hypnotically lovely film in which death’s emissary is a striking woman who rides around in a black Rolls-Royce flanked by motorcyclists. “A legend is entitled to be beyond time and place,” the narrator in Cocteau’s film says. “Interpret it as you wish …”In “Annihilation” it’s Lena who assumes the role of Orpheus, descending into a transfigured world filled with terrors, death, eccentric beauty and room for interpretive leeway. She and the other women have been tasked with understanding both the shimmer and why earlier expeditions failed so profoundly. With Dr. Ventress riding herd, Lena and the others — a paramedic (Gina Rodriguez), a physicist (Tessa Thompson) and an anthropologist (Tuva Novotny) — survey the terrain, take samples and fight off threats, including, in time, one another. They also discover a horrific video made by an earlier expedition, a scene that abruptly shifts the movie into a Grand Guignol freakout.Mr. Garland likes to play with tones, mixing deadpan in with the frights, and later “Annihilation” becomes something of a head movie, swirling with cosmic and menacingly lysergic visions. He keeps the tension torqued throughout this phantasmagoric interlude, sustaining the shivery unease that is one of this movie’s deeper satisfactions. Something is troubling Lena, whose personal life comes into focus over a series of flashbacks that are entirely too banal. Ms. Portman does her part with presence and persuasive stern looks, yet there’s something missing from Mr. Garland’s conception of Lena, whose mythic story bristles with dread but lacks the soul that might make you care."

The movie’s second lead character, a consciousness or, if you will, soul that refers to itself as “A,” inexplicably wakes up every morning inhabiting a different teenager’s body. “A” has this amazing personality that it supposedly tries not to let impinge overmuch on its host’s own personality. But one morning, A wakes up in the body of the handsome but loutish Justin. He’s the boyfriend of Rhiannon, a bright, beautiful high schooler who deserves better. And thanks to A, she gets it, for one magical day of hooky.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 14, 2018After which A is, well, hooked. It pursues a skeptical-to-the-point-of-freaked-out (wouldn’t you be?) Rhiannon from a variety of bodies, male and female. Midway through the picture, A wakes up in Rhiannon’s body, and the twist, while reminiscent of one in “Being John Malkovich,” is heartwarmingly benign.Now would be a good time to point out that Charlie Kaufman did not write this — the screenplay is by Jesse Andrews, from a novel by David Levithan. (It is perhaps no accident, however, that one of the film’s producers is Anthony Bregman, who also produced three Kaufman-penned movies.) The director is Michael Sucsy, who is not always up to the challenges of the knotty material — we live in a world of mainstream movies with clumsy edits, but this one has more conspicuously bad cuts than most. The cast does excellent work, particularly Justice Smith, who as Justin gets to play World’s Worst and Best boyfriend and nails both. And as Rhiannon, the appealing Angourie Rice is just the kind of teenager you root for in the finding-true-love department."

The film’s protagonist, Eli (Michael Patrick Nicholson), is a soulful-eyed no-account hipster. He’s got a lot of anxiety (bites his fingernails frequently) but not much else: no girlfriend, no job, no home.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 13, 2018Eli takes a gig trucking an engine upstate, and in the desolate winter setting, takes to chugging antifreeze (or some such horrific liquid) with a local resident, who takes him to a place the end credits call Sludge Club. That’s accurate. There he meets Anya (Chelsea Lopez), who has a purple pageboy wig and a devotion to vintage soul music that’s compelled her to create a Rube Goldbergesque light show machine to accompany her tunes. When she removes her wig, she has a head of stringy hair that rather resembles that of the Crypt Keeper on that old horror anthology TV show “Tales From the Crypt.”So that’s different. Written and directed by Xander Robin, the movie continues in this peculiar vein, taking in Anya’s hair-eating fetish/compulsion and depicting its consequences. The picture climaxes with a grisly hairball-removal scene accompanied on the soundtrack by Timmy Thomas’s catchy classic “Why Can’t We Live Together.” You have to wonder what the music supervisor’s pitch was in seeking permission for its use. “Are We Not Cats” is a well-put-together film with a lot of striking imagery, but, as you may have already inferred, something of a specialty item."

Romero, who has since gone to the grave himself; the TV series “The Walking Dead” and “Fear the Walking Dead”; and the zombie-adjacent “Maze Runner” movies.Anyone digging through the cemetery soil again had better have fresh ideas. “The Cured,” the debut feature from David Freyne, has roughly two.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 13, 2018The first is to replace the usual horror tropes with stealth kitchen-sink realism. In the movie’s zombie-ravaged Ireland, a mostly effective cure has been found. But the cured, once released, become second-class citizens, barely employable and shunned by their families, who still remember their actions when they were monsters. This fate befalls Senan (Sam Keeley), who moves in with his sister-in-law (Ellen Page) after treatment and is regarded essentially as an ex-con.The second idea is to turn “The Cured” into a sort of Irish Republican Army allegory. Senan and his friend Conor (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor) lead double lives and participate in a group that sets bombs at night. The Maze Virus, as it’s known, may be named for the prison of Bobby Sands’s hunger strike.But neither conceit pays off, perhaps because seeing either through would mean keeping the zombies sidelined.

Vulgarity and violence abound, not least among the movie’s most entertaining characters: foul-tempered, supernatural slaves known as kratts and assembled from scrap metal and animal bones. When, early in the movie, one of these clanking contraptions steals a cow and carries it into the air, the sight is alarmingly, seductively strange.“I want to work!” screeches a kratt, voicing the mantra of gadgets that find idleness so intolerable they view it as a reason to kill their makers.

Its central couple, Max and Annie, played by Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, are avid board-game-and-trivia enthusiasts who are stuck in the fertility department. They’re having trouble conceiving because Max’s sperm are, according to his doctor, insecure.

The gun Brooks leaves behind is very much real and loaded, as Max learns when one of its rounds goes through his arm. It’s at junctures like this when the movie becomes less conventional, although it never soars. The dialogue leans so heavily on pop culture references you have to wonder whether the film’s screenwriter, Mark Perez, is as insecure as his creation Max.The directors, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who were behind the repellent 2015 film “Vacation,” show relative restraint here, in spite of a set piece that involves an adorable little dog getting its immaculate white coat doused with blood. And all the cast members — particularly the friends and neighbors played by Chelsea Peretti, Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris and Jesse Plemons (who, as an uptight cop, delivers a deliberately robotic idea of a Matt Damon impersonation) — are very funny when they get the opportunity to be. And the movie is a pointed reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema’s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses.

A running joke in the film imagines an interviewer asking Mr. Maciunas what “flux” is, and never quite managing to get a definition.Reviewing an exhibition on the occasion of the manifesto’s 50th anniversary, Holland Cotter, writing in The New York Times, described Fluxus as a “giant nebula of international collective activity” that was “anti-capitalist, anti-elitist, pro-community and pro-play.” Jonas Mekas, a friend of Mr. Maciunas’s who made his own film about him, says Mr. Maciunas was trying to bring a sense of lightness to art.ImageThere is no shortage of vintage Fluxus footage of performance pieces in Mr. Perkins's documentary.CreditPeter MooreThe director of “George,” Jeffrey Perkins, an artist who is described in his own biography as a Fluxus associate, emphasizes the contradictions of the enigmatic ringleader. Was Mr. Maciunas a significant artist himself or more of an organizer? Was Fluxus an original idea or did it simply seize on a post-Dada spirit that was already fueling conceptual and performance art across the globe in the 1960s? Fluxus may have been a way for the domineering Mr. Maciunas, an admirer of military history, to try to conquer and monopolize the avant-garde — though at times he had some difficulty bending artists to his will. And the Fluxus philosophy had democratic and even utopian underpinnings.Mr. Perkins livens up what could have been a dull talking-heads presentation with vortex-like editing, often dividing the screen into multiple panels and making inventive use of sound design. There is no shortage of vintage Fluxus footage or arcana to draw on; the interviews, old and new, with Maciunas associates like Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik and Henry Flynt are informative and often fascinatingly contradictory.Although Mr. Maciunas’s art work and performances have had some lasting influence — Sonic Youth performed a rendition of a piece in which a piano is destroyed — “George” leaves the impression that one enduring legacy may also be in real estate. He brought together colleagues to purchase property south of Houston Street, founding what has been reported as the first artist cooperative there. The experimental playwright Richard Foreman is blunt: “As far as I’m concerned, he created SoHo,” he says.At two hours, the documentary is overstuffed, possibly by design. But it matches a kaleidoscopic form to a kaleidoscopic life story, honoring its subject without simplifying him."

The German workers who come to a remote rural valley in Bulgaria to build a hydroelectric plant are emissaries of the West, bringing the ambiguous benefits of capitalist development to a former Eastern Bloc nation. It’s not the first time Germans have been here, as several people point out, even if the crew hardly resembles an occupying army.But they do call to mind the cavalrymen in a movie like “Fort Apache”: interlopers in someone else’s territory, surrounded by a local population that is wary of their presence and sometimes hostile to it. The Germans live in a camp some distance from the nearest village, whose residents most of them regard with contempt. The exception is Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann), who is older than most of his colleagues and has a different work history. A haggard loner with a thousand-yard stare and a melancholy air, he claims to be a former soldier who has been in inhospitable places before. He befriends some of the Bulgarians, which spreads tension in every direction.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 1, 2018To stick with the “Fort Apache” analogy, Meinhard is like the John Wayne character, interested in the “natives” and respectful of their customs. His boss, Vincent (Reinhardt Wetrek), is a bit more like Henry Fonda: arrogant, incurious, convinced of his own superiority. When he harasses Vyara (Vyara Borisova), a local woman who is swimming near the German camp, he threatens to put the whole enterprise at risk. The possibility of violence buzzes in the air like insects in the summer heat.But rather than force a situation drawn from contemporary reality into a ready-made genre box, Ms. Grisebach plays with the implications of the western and the expectations of the audience. At various points, we may think we know where the story is heading — sometimes dreading an inevitable tragedy, sometimes embracing a promise of reconciliation or redemption — but the film is as full of detours and switchbacks as the mountain roads its characters must negotiate.And those characters are not always who they seem to be, even to themselves. Meinhard comes across as more sensitive, more stoical and tougher than his colleagues — more of a man, in the old gunslinger ethos — but it’s possible that he overestimates his own mastery of a complex situation. It’s also possible that his displays of decency toward the villagers are motivated by selfishness as much as altruism and that he may not be the righteous nice guy they take him for.ImageReinhardt Wetrek, center, as one of the German workers who travel to Bulgaria to build a hydroelectric plant.CreditCinema GuildEverything about “Western” may be knottier and more contradictory than it initially appears, but it also might be simpler. The friendship between Meinhard and Adrian (Syuleyman Alilov Lefitov), a local landowner and businessman, is direct and affectionate, and the actors show how intimacy can develop without a common language. Meinhard, nicknamed the “legionnaire,” is jokingly described as Adrian’s bodyguard, and events will test the extent and intensity of his loyalty.Geopolitics and global economics are elements in the atmosphere, less themes of the movie than part of the air its inhabitants breathe. It’s worth noting that Maren Ade, whose “Toni Erdmann” is also about a German expatriate in a Balkan country, is credited as a producer of “Western.” (Ms. Grisebach was a script consultant on “Toni Erdmann.”) Both films combine highly specific individual narratives with sharp, critical scrutiny of the way the world is organized now — the imbalances of power and autonomy that inevitably, though not always predictably, influence the ways people behave toward one another.“Anything can happen in a village,” Adrian says ruefully, as matters seem to be coming to a head. It’s something of a rebuttal to Meinhard’s earlier observation that the one consistent truth of the human condition is the domination of the weak by the strong. But there are different kinds of strength, and there are also other factors at work, including laziness, whim, habit and random chance. The western as a genre, like Meinhard, believes in determinism, in a history governed by laws and patterns. “Western” has its doubts.There is no doubting Ms. Grisebach’s filmmaking. Her eye for faces and for nuances of gesture and posture is matched by her ability to capture the beauty and strangeness of the landscape, and to make sense of its intricate geography. “Western” is as precise as a dropped pin on a GPS map, which makes its sense of mystery all the more powerful."

There’s soccer, too.","2018-02-15","2018-02-16","2018-03-15 16:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/movies/early-man-review-aardman-animations.html,Read the New York Times Review of Early Man,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/arts/16earlymanREEFER/16earlyman1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"My feelings about “Early Man” can be summed up as better late than never. I’m a little sorry that this utterly silly feature from Nick Park and Aardman Animations was not around when I was 7 or 8 years old, or when my children were wearing out the Wallace and Gromit videocassettes that someone had given them for Christmas. Not that anyone could outgrow this kind of movie, which manages to be fresh and delightful even as some of its jokes are so old — how old? So old that the last time I heard them, I fell off my dinosaur I was laughing so hard.About that: In prehistoric times, according to Mr. Park and the screenwriters (Mark Burton and James Higginson), cave men and giant lizards shared the planet for a while. A bit later, descendants of those same cave-dwellers — a band of genial, not-too-bright hunter-gatherers in a verdant valley near what is now Manchester, England — coexisted uneasily with a more aggressive and arrogant breed of humans, who mastered metallurgy, stadium-building and sports commentary. “The age of stone is over. The age of bronze is here,” they proclaim as they drive the Stone Agers into the wasteland.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 29, 2018It would be pedantic in the extreme to fault this movie for its inaccurate rendering of the past. Did mammoths’ feet in ancient times walk upon England’s green and pleasant land? Does the fossil record contain evidence of a mallard the size of a 727? You might as well ask if there are La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland. As Bugs Bunny will tell you, there are no La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland.But I would not go so far as to say that “Early Man” is entirely devoid of historical interest. Its structuring myth is the loss of Arcadia. A peaceful and authentic way of life is threatened with destruction by the forces of modernity, and the threat is resisted in a stirring and potentially tragic show of courage. The encounter between the simple, primitive folk and their more sophisticated would-be conquerors may remind you of the films of Mel Gibson. Mr. Park has essentially remade “Apocalypto” but with soccer instead of human sacrifice, “Braveheart” with a giant stop-motion duck.Another way to look at this movie might be as an artisanal cartoon exploration of the story told by the Yale political scientist James Scott in his recent book “Against the Grain.” According to Mr. Scott (no relation to the present writer), the rise of states — of political authority, organized violence, accumulated wealth and everything else we associate with the advance of civilization — was a disaster for our species: a blow to our autonomy, our solidarity, our moral and physical health. Or, to put the argument in “Early Man” terms, we were happier when we were chasing rabbits instead of building monuments, fighting wars and paying taxes. The rabbits, all things considered, were probably happier, too.The movie swears allegiance to that halcyon, carefree world, where humor is a matter of laughing with rather than at. The laws of gravity and the innate clumsiness of the human body are always good for a chuckle, and nobody really gets hurt. Dug (Eddie Redmayne), a friendly nincompoop with the usual Aardman features — a wide rubbery mouth holding a few blunt teeth; a narrow brow; wide, placid eyes — lives happily in an easygoing society with minimal hierarchy and ample leisure time. (The chief, voiced by Timothy Spall, is more camp counselor than warlord.) Dug and his pals are oblivious to the future and dimly aware of the past. Ancient drawings point to a vaguely recollected moment of origin, a creation story that the audience already knows (it’s the opening scene) and will eventually be rediscovered.ImageA scene from the film.CreditLionsgateFirst, though, they must face the villainy of the Bronze Agers, soccer-mad imperialists led by a classic Aardman baddie named Lord Nooth (Tom Hiddleston). He has what sounds suspiciously like a French accent, though he answers — mostly via bird-enabled instant messaging — to a very British queen (Miriam Margolyes). His footballers are cosmopolitan superstars whose skills are as formidable as their egos. For reasons too ridiculous to summarize (and yet also absolutely persuasive), Dug and his mates must master the beautiful game and face off against Lord Nooth’s squad.Does this ragtag band of misfits, coached by a renegade named Goona (Maisie Williams), stand a chance against a bunch of hot shots with flowing locks, fancy uniforms, and all the talent and training that Nooth’s lucre can buy? You tell me. The genius of “Early Man” is that it cannot possibly be spoiled. The animation is foolproof in its combination of ingenuity and obviousness, and the script obliterates the difference between a laugher and a groaner.You might believe that you are too refined to giggle at even one not-too-naughty double-entendre about the fact that soccer is played with balls, let alone a dozen or so. You are so wrong. If you’re a Premier League fan, you might beat the script to a joke about “Early Man United” by a good hour and still laugh like an idiot when it arrives. I could write 500 more words explaining the semiotics of the big duck routine, and you would still be amazed by how brilliant and how dumb it is at the same time.Just like us! Humanity, I mean, in our primal, primitive state, to which “Early Man” pays paradoxically sophisticated tribute. You remember how it was, before we got all snooty and fancy and mean: One of us fell down, the rest of us doubled over in mirth, and someone else made a picture so we could laugh at the thing all over again as many times as we wanted."

A soggy string of Hallmark moments designed to interrogate the value of the objects we cherish, the movie is front-loaded with major stars and squelching with sentiment. To say it’s depressing, then, is to state the obvious; less evident is why Mr. Pellington, previously known for suspenseful thrillers like “Arlington Road” and “The Mothman Prophecies,” would dive down this rabbit hole at all.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 30, 2018Beset by a moony piano and maudlin musings about the stuff we carry (“Can what we hold in our hands be the same as what we hold in our hearts?”), the film follows for a time an eye-rollingly empathetic insurance assessor (John Ortiz) as he helps bereaved clients answer that question. A lonely octogenarian (Bruce Dern) prepares for death by taking inventory of his possessions; a distraught widow (Ellen Burstyn) salvages keepsakes from her burned-out home.Picking up the narrative baton, Jon Hamm takes over as the most softhearted collectibles expert ever. But it’s here, in the movie’s longest section, that this repetitive dirge — inspired by a 2013 article in The New York Times — gains thematic heft from exceptionally strong performances. Catherine Keener and James LeGros excel as a grieving couple, and Mikey Madison (riveting as the eldest daughter in FX’s “Better Things,”) is so moving as Kathleen, a mourning teenager, that we want to give her her own movie.Fascinated by the Portuguese word “saudade,” Kathleen defines it as “a pleasure you suffer, a pain you enjoy.” If that’s what Mr. Pellington was going for, he was half successful."

And Brooklyn has a fourth resident, Amy (Deirdre O’Connell), a kind landlord who is always there to provide wise counsel to Diana — an aspiring writer, of course.How, and in whose apartment, Diana and Ben will confess their emotions is the subject of Ms. Brooks’s pallid dramedy, which leaves its actors looking somewhat stranded, as if waiting for Neil Simon zingers that were never written. It doesn’t matter that there’s little suspense to the central romance (Ben and Diana still obviously have feelings for each other); people don’t always resolve their confusion in real time.

You’d never know it from looking at “Honor Up,” a new movie he directed from a script he wrote with Kevin Bennett.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnFeb. 1, 2018The filmmaking is point-and-shoot rudimentary (when it wants to get fancy, it resorts to split-screen effects that bring to mind the 1980s production software called Video Toaster). The acting is awkward (Mr. Dash himself has a leading role), and the characters themselves indifferently delineated. Clichés are rife, both in dialogue (“Sometimes good guys have to do bad things”) and construction (shootout scenes are frequently scored to arias and fake-arias sung by Radmila Lolly).And yet this anecdotal movie about drug dealers and their internecine troubles, and their further troubles with the justice system, can be oddly persuasive. Narrated by Mr. Dash’s character, named O.G., the movie begins by laying out the meaning of the title phrase. Which is pretty much what you’d infer: that you don’t rat out your partners in the criminal enterprise that players call “the game.” The movie then shows various gang members and rivals facing each other down, wiping each other out, and eventually giving each other up.Nicholas Turturro as a relentless and racist cop, and Eishia Brightwell as the ostensibly “off limits” sister of a dealer who tries to get herself a piece of gang action, make particularly vivid impressions. For all of its failings, the movie sometimes manages to bring a scary whiff of the street into its sounds and images."

His body droops and his face sags, jowls draping under a thatch of beard. He’s playing Bill, who’s somewhat of a mystery man. For a long while, all that you really know about Bill is that he’s married to Janet (Kristin Scott Thomas), the woman cheerfully bustling in the kitchen. Also: He likes vinyl. Every so often, Bill miraculously manages to gather together his flaccid bits so he can put on a record. Then, with a bottle of wine by his side, he collapses back into his chair, resuming his man-of-sorrows pose.Bill’s bearing is matched by his bleak story, which leaks out over the course of this grindingly unhappy affair. Written and directed by Sally Potter, who has made other movies worth seeing — “Thriller,” “Orlando,” “Ginger & Rosa” — “The Party” is a brittle, unfunny attempt at comedy that features some very fine actors and a lot of empty chatter. It takes place inside a few rooms on the ground-level floor of Bill and Janet’s comfortable London digs. There, they are giving a party to celebrate Janet’s recent appointment as a government functionary of the unnamed opposition party. From the way she furtively coos into her cellphone, it is clear that Janet has some secrets.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 30, 2018These secrets also slowly leak out over the course of a 71-minute black-and-white movie that mostly comes off like a futile filmmaking exercise in how to move bodies inside a (largely) confined space. It’s a familiar conceit: Place a group of actors inside a box and go! (Hitchcock was a master of this: “Lifeboat,” “Rope,” “Rear Window” and most of “Dial M for Murder.”) You get to know this part of Janet and Bill’s home — the kitchen, bathroom and a living room that lets out onto a courtyard — fairly intimately because Ms. Potter gives the characters plenty of reasons to move from one space to another. One snorts drugs in the bathroom, another takes weeping refuge in it, a third hurls in the toilet, while others meander here and there.As to what happens, well, there are shards of drama and melodrama, many meant to cut and hurt. Janet’s triumph is soon dampened and eventually spoiled by her friends, most of whom prove a convenient, presumably emblematic collection of narcissists. It’s all about them, their lives and needs, which they readily share, turning the festivities into a group-therapy session. The funniest and meanest of Janet’s pals is played by Patricia Clarkson, and while you don’t believe her character for a second, the performance — Ms. Clarkson’s supple nonchalance suggests years of practiced cruelty — is enjoyable. Cherry Jones, Emily Mortimer, Bruno Ganz and Cillian Murphy also enter and deliver lines.Ms. Potter stirs things up, though to no identifiable end. Characters talk and talk, mostly at one another, and they bitch, argue and fight. The level of animus feels as contrived as it is narratively useful, as is often the case in the bad-party movie, itself at times a subset of the confined-space flick. (“The Party” recalls the TV version of Mike Leigh’s suburban roast “Abigail’s Party”). Janet’s appointment and the periodic references to politics past and present — as well as to children, identity, feminism, love and its betrayal — gesture at ideas, none developed. The lack of political specificity (the characters are vaguely coded as left-leaning) dulls whatever critique Ms. Potter is after. In the end, the big point is that people are complex, though alas not nearly enough here."

The result is a good-looking but overstuffed genre pileup that confuses as often as it compels.Set in 1953 when Vietnam was under French colonial rule, the story — inspired by the recollections of Mr. Nguyen’s grandmother, a former housemaid — takes place on a sprawling rubber plantation belonging to Sebastien (Jean-Michel Richaud), a handsome French officer. When an orphan named Linh (Nhung Kate) joins his small house staff, she enters a terrifying world where creaks and whispers and vibrating strings follow her from room to room. Everyone, it seems, harbors shameful secrets, not least the house itself, where Sebastien’s wife and baby died and a wraithlike apparition flits and hovers.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 30, 2018Drawing equally from Hitchcock and the clammy scares of Japanese horror movies like “Ju-on: The Grudge” (2002), Mr. Nguyen whips up a spectral stew of past atrocities and present-day hanky-panky. Lush, verdant exteriors — vibrantly photographed by Sam Chase — define a plantation where, according to Sebastien’s garrulous cook, hundreds of Vietnamese workers were brutalized. Bleeding foliage and a mass grave back her up, but the movie’s invocation of slavery and Holocaust-like imagery feels overshadowed and muted by its soapy center.Shot in Vietnam (where it was released in 2016), “The Housemaid” is an ambitious, atmospheric first feature that — notwithstanding a rather nifty twist at the end — would have benefited from a more rigorous editor. It’s a setting so fertile with real-life horrors that any narrative embellishment can only feel like too much of a bad thing."

Her wet hair, pale face and the gray background impart a simple elegance to the sequence. The following scene takes place in the bleaker confines of a gynecologist’s office. In one shot, the screen fills with the colors pink and silver. Viewers may wonder exactly what they are seeing at first, but as the camera zooms out it becomes clear: a speculum seen from the point of view of a doctor conducting a vaginal examination. The shot dissolves into a geometrically corresponding close-up of Chloé’s eye.The straightforward explicitness of the imagery is a hallmark of François Ozon, the film’s director (his best known films include the thrillers “See the Sea” and “Swimming Pool”); the juxtaposition is very Georges Bataille (he wrote a piece of outré eroticism titled “Story of the Eye”). Some might say it’s all very French, and perhaps it is. But it does make one sit up and take notice. The clever thing about it is that it’s not until the movie is almost over that the viewer can fully understand this imagery as something more than an effective, but perhaps idle provocation.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 29, 2018Chloé, looking underweight, has complained about chronic stomach pains to her gynecologist. And on that doctor’s advice, she starts seeing a psychoanalyst, Paul (Jérémie Renier). He’s handsome, gentle, compassionate. He “cures” her, they confess romantic feelings for each other, and they move in together. One small glitch is that he does not much care for her cat Milo. A bigger glitch comes soon after that: Chloé meets another psychoanalyst, Paul’s double, who claims to be his twin brother. He’s a rougher character who likes his own cat, a specimen of a rare breed. He thinks he can cure Chloé of a new complaint, and there’s lots of athletic sex involved in the treatment.What’s going on here? The doubling imagery, the recurring spiral staircases, and so much else engulfing Chloé make this thriller unusually engrossing. “Double Lover” nods a bit to David Cronenberg’s “Dead Ringers” (1988) and Roman Polanski’s “The Tenant” (1976), two arguably classic thrillers on doppelgängers and madness, and Mr. Ozon’s stylistic gymnastics sometimes bring to mind Brian De Palma, who made a film about good/bad twins early in his career. But “Double Lover,” which Mr. Ozon “freely adapted” from the Joyce Carol Oates book “Lives of the Twins,” spins its influences into a frenzy that ultimately reveals the story to be very much its own thing. And a crazy, and eventually strangely moving, thing it is. As elaborate as its visuals are, the movie is also intimate. There aren’t many characters besides Chloé and the twins, which adds to the frisson late in the movie when the great Jacqueline Bisset makes her entrance.Mr. Renier is clearly having a blast as the twins, but Ms. Vacth, who worked with Mr. Ozon on the 2014 film “Young and Beautiful,” does more than hold her own opposite him. She modulates Chloé’s mood from slumping vulnerability to hip-swinging confidence, from a whirlpool of self-doubt and near despair to defiance. “Double Lover” is as much, if not more, Ms. Vacth’s movie as it is the director’s."

What is provocative about the technique here is that it’s a sort of workaround — a way for the director, Ali Soozandeh, who grew up in Iran and now lives in Germany, to tell a story that he says would have been impossible to film in Tehran.An ensemble piece (and European production, despite the Persian dialogue), the movie lays bare the double standards that surround sex in Iran. Its confrontational quality is established in the opening scene: A driver picks up a prostitute who is turning tricks with her young son in tow — and moments later expresses horror when he spots a man holding hands with his daughter.VideoA preview of the film.Published OnJan. 30, 2018Pari (Elmira Rafizadeh), the prostitute, needs a judge (Hasan Ali Mete) to sign her divorce papers. She lives in an apartment he owns and trades sex for his influence, which later helps ensure her son’s enrollment at school.One of Pari’s neighbors is Sara (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), who is uneasy about her latest pregnancy and also wants to take a job, which she can’t do without her husband’s permission. The other principal thread concerns a musician, Babak (Arash Marandi), who, after a nightclub tryst with Donya (Negar Mona Alizadeh), has a week to pay for an unsanitary quack doctor with a hacking cough to restore the appearance of her virginity.Subtlety and aesthetic elegance — the jerky animation complements the blunt tone — are not among the film’s virtues. “Tehran Taboo” aims to expose systemic hypocrisy; in that respect, it is brisk and bracing."

These words are spoken fairly late in the movie, which traces the emotional and psychological architecture of two intersecting groups of men and women. For the most part, they make an absurdly comic, at times pitifully narcissistic assembly — you laugh at them and then you cringe. White and mostly comfortably middle-class or bourgeois adjacent, they have nice homes, jobs and people they love and some they scarcely tolerate. They also have a lot of time to talk about themselves and their discontent, which eats at some and all but consumes others.A virtuoso of unease, the 33-year-old Mr. Perry makes films that seem almost calculated to go against the grain of contemporary American independent cinema. He isn’t interested in tidy or nice stories and feelings, much less lessons, uplift, closure or relatability. His movies are talky, intimate to the point of claustrophobia, and populated by characters that can be charitably described as prickly. You wouldn’t necessarily want to spend time with them in real life; among other things, their foibles can feel squirmingly familiar. But Mr. Perry is such a good filmmaker that he can make the embarrassing and the unbearable insistently, fascinatingly engrossing (and often funny).“Golden Exits” takes place in a lonely, prettily tree-lined corner of Brooklyn where even the most populated streets feel empty. The story’s hub is a newly arrived young Australian, Naomi (Emily Browning), who has taken a temporary job with an archivist, Nick (Adam Horovitz). He’s married to Alyssa (Chloë Sevigny), a therapist, and is organizing his dead father-in-law’s papers or “materials,” as he testily puts it. Nick and Alyssa’s marriage seems locked in a slow-moving death spiral. “Do I need to be worried about Naomi?” Alyssa asks. Nick, who has a habit of fidgeting with his wedding ring, answers no (more or less).Naomi — her beauty, youth and novelty — disturbs the fragile geometry created by Nick, Alyssa and Alyssa’s supremely thorny, self-satisfied sister, Gwen (a peerless Mary-Louise Parker). Together, these three mirror a younger trio that enters when Naomi meets up Buddy (Jason Schwartzman), a childhood acquaintance who runs a recording studio with his wife, Jess (Analeigh Tipton). Buddy seems charmed by Naomi but he too is discomforted, almost destabilized by her. When Buddy first tells Jess about his plans to meet up with an old acquaintance, he agitatedly paces the room, eliding specifics only to blurt “it’s a her,” as if he were confessing a sin. “Sorry if that was unclear.”ImageEmily Browning plays Naomi, whose arrival disturbs the fragile geometry of a trio of characters in “Golden Exits.”CreditVertical Entertainment/Stage 6 FilmsOver the next months, a period marked by time stamps (“April 12”), the triangulated relationships among these disparate characters shift, overlap and almost collapse with near-mathematical precision. Much of the movie takes place in rooms that are either modestly sized (Nick’s broom closet of an office) or are framed and shot to convey constriction and limitation. Working with a low budget that never becomes a hindrance, Mr. Perry uses exterior space to convey interiority, as when Alyssa speaks to Nick — who keeps his back to her — from across a room that feels like a vast, unpassable chasm. (The director of photography is Sean Price Williams; the editor is Robert Greene.)There’s poignancy to these characters and how they keep reaching and fumbling for one another across the divide. In one scene, Gwen sits in Alyssa’s living room, the two sisters talking, mostly and awkwardly about Nick. They inelegantly hold glasses of wine while sitting at a distance from each other — an off-kilter, uncomfortable arrangement that adds to the disquiet. Here, as throughout, the framing remains steady, a visual choice that can feel like a long, hard, pitiless stare. The scene that follows directly echoes this one, but takes place in Jess’s apartment where she’s hanging out with her sister, Sam (Lily Rabe). Except that these two are intimately seated right across from each other.Sam is talking about leaving her job as “a glorified personal assistant” for an older woman. Sam compares herself both to her boss, who is contentedly single, and to Jess, who seems happily married. “I don’t want to feel adrift in some nebulous middle ground,” Sam says. “Where am I?” she wonders, repeating the question twice. She answers it herself: “Wasteland.” To which Jess gently responds: “Heavy handed and dramatic, minus five points.” It’s a small, recognizably true and complex moment as Sam’s self-absorption is met by a sisterly reality check. Each smiles — one weakly yet warmly, the other almost fitfully — and then Sam abruptly asks if Buddy is seeing another woman.This intimation of marital disloyalty — a suggestion that is itself a betrayal — is a moment of casual cruelty in a movie filled with cuts and wounds, some Oedipal. “Golden Exits” is partly indebted to Woody Allen and Eric Rohmer, cinematic patriarchs with long shadows. Mr. Perry has a thing for celebrated fathers: the dead painter in “Queen of Earth,” the monstrous literary legend in “Listen Up Philip.” In “Golden Exits,” the legacy of Alyssa and Gwen’s father hangs over their lives and can feel like a rebuke to their pettiness and navel gazing. It’s difficult to imagine these self-involved sisters having a legacy that’s worth archiving, which also seems to be part of their father’s endowment.Which brings me back to “love, jealousy and deficiency,” a phrase that the determinedly unhappy Sam unloads on Naomi. Sam is holding forth on relationships, but as is often true of most everyone in “Golden Exits,” she is also talking about herself. “My problem is that personal dynamics ebb and flow,” she says, though it’s obvious she has no idea what her problem is. Sam wants to leave her job “on a high note, a perfect final moment” (a phrase that seems to nod at the film’s title). She adds that “family doesn’t afford that endless optimism for happy endings.” There’s something in her pessimism, but as Sam keeps talking — and talking — about herself, both Naomi and the world slip away."

He is the peacemaker of this film’s title. The documentary, directed by James Demo, is not a portrait of an idealist. The Irish-born Mr. O’Malley is an often dour man, and when he speaks of his work, there are no stars in his eyes. One of his recent books, about Israel and Palestine, is called “The Two State Delusion.” In negotiation, as the movie shows, he is pragmatic, focused and often steely.His story is an unusual one, which the director unspools by showing Mr. O’Malley first in a war-torn Iraq, then in the streets of Cambridge, Mass., where he teaches. (He travels so frequently he calls no place “home”). He enters a church, and we soon understand he’s in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Filming an A.A. meeting isn’t exactly kosher, but Mr. Demo doesn’t show the faces of the other attendees. (It’s not quite clear that this session hasn’t been staged specifically for the movie.)A good part of the picture relies on Mr. O’Malley’s account of his life with and without the bottle — members call it a “qualification” — during this A.A. gathering. He tells how he started in conflict mediation when, in the early ’70s, he bought a Cambridge bar and funneled its revenue into hosting a negotiation between warring factions of Northern Ireland — a first for these groups.“I don’t love anybody,” the lanky, white-haired Mr. O’Malley admits during one interview segment. It’s his peculiar detachment, perhaps, that makes him good at what he does, even when the summits he hosts — he spent years in Iraq and in South Africa — yield nothing more than agreements on bilingual street signs. The movie is a fascinating portrait that is if anything too brief."

Now, with “Fifty Shades Freed,” we’ve reached what the publicity notes are pleased to call “the climactic chapter” of this titillation trilogy based on the heavy-breathing novels of E.L. James. If another sequel shows up, though, I’m going to have to use my safe word.Layering a damp-squib thriller subplot beneath what appears to be an ad campaign for the one-percent lifestyle, the returning director and screenwriter (James Foley and Niall Leonard) test the newly married couple with an inconvenient pregnancy and an unconvincing car chase. There’s an out-of-left-field abduction and a marital tiff over email addresses; but these narrative fragments, lazily tossed together alongside a neglected supporting cast, are no more than a flimsy causeway connecting bonking sessions.Invariably accompanied by wailing makeout music and sometimes a dairy product, these function simultaneously as the movie’s raison d’être and its creamy topping. Yet with the couple’s power dynamic seemingly settled — he’s a controlling chauvinist, she’s mostly fine with that — the rods and restraints are no longer necessary negotiating tools. Now, it’s just married sex, albeit more rippling and racy than most.As popular as this window-fogging franchise has become, its flaccid finale is likely critic proof. But if I can persuade just one of you to bypass its milquetoast masochism and watch the stratospherically superior “9 1/2 Weeks” instead, then I will have done my job."

Though she also handles lower-profile cases, she’s best known for sitting with clients behind banks of microphones, or standing in front of cameras at protests and marches.Such images have given her a reputation as a grandstander and media manipulator. She counters that her methods hold powerful figures accountable and provide their often-silenced victims with a voice, “even if they can’t have justice in the conventional setting of a court of law.”This energetic film unabashedly supports that view as the directors, Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman, trace Ms. Allred’s long history of activism. The first scene shows her speaking on Dinah Shore’s talk show in 1977, and an excellent and well edited (Chris Callister) collection of news footage charts her legal fights and victories. Her early stands on gay rights and women’s issues, frequently unpopular when she made them, seem prescient today.Few of Ms. Allred’s detractors are heard from, and the directors don’t press her to divulge too much about her personal life or to refute criticisms. (When she says she doesn’t care what others think of her, you believe it.) Still, the filmmakers capture some revealing stories, particularly when Ms. Allred recalls her own ordeals, including a rape and her subsequent abortion. Although other scenes show us what Ms. Allred does, those moments hint at why she does it."

In “Permission,” a birthday celebration turns awkward when Reece (Morgan Spector) mentions an elephant in the room: Anna (Rebecca Hall), who is turning 30, and Will (Dan Stevens) have only ever gone out with each other. They’re likely to marry, and they’re clearly a perfect, consistent couple — but aren’t they the least bit curious about what sex with other people is like?Despite Reece’s apology the next day, the idea sticks, and once agreed to, the swinging experiment pays off with astonishing speed. The roulette wheel of New York City dating is no problem for Will and Anna, even with a lack of practice. On the couple’s first night out, Anna, a music historian whose thesis draft has the mind-melting title “Female Composers + Feminism – Matriarchal Pedagogy = Feminist Composers” meets the composer-rocker of her dreams, Dane (François Arnaud). Soon after, Will responds to the flirtations of a divorcée, Lydia (Gina Gershon), who walks into his store, where he sells, in what one hopes is unintentional Freudianism, wood furniture.“Permission” actually offers a double dose of couples therapy, according nearly equal screen time to Reece and his relationship with Hale (David Joseph Craig), Anna’s brother, who desperately wants a baby. The movie raises questions about how the pairs choose to talk or not talk to each other, even while inviting inadvertent musing on how all the characters can afford such nice apartments. There’s also an intriguing musical-chairs aspect to the casting: Ms. Hall is in fact married to Mr. Spector, while Mr. Craig is married to the film’s writer and director, Brian Crano. It’s easy to envision “Permission” reconceived as a gimmick-driven Off Broadway play in which the generally very good leads swap roles every week.Ms. Hall, though, is the standout, selling Anna’s indecision even through some of the script’s dubious patches. (It’s bad enough that Dane is such a thinly conceived Prince Charming; Will’s epiphanic drug trip with Lydia is an even worse cliché.) And it should be said that “Permission” really shows its teeth in the homestretch. If unwise remarks at a dinner can cast a pall over a longstanding relationship, then a great ending can redeem and even force reconsideration of an otherwise middling film."

Over in Britain, at least, this development has been met with great trepidation. “Another kids’ classic wrecked forever,” read a headline of one U.K. article last fall, a review of this film’s trailer. (I still can’t get over the fact that reviewing trailers is now a thing.)The film in its entirety, I found, was not as bad as the trailer looked to many. Yes, right away the movie dispenses with the sweetness and light and lyricism of the books by Beatrix Potter. A chorus of birds flying over the British countryside, singing an air that sounds as if it may turn into the title song of “The Sound of Music,” is swept out of frame to make way for blue-jacketed Peter, whose wisecracks and egocentricity rather recall that of an American cartoon bunny, Bugs. But given that the wisecracks are voiced by the London-born James Corden, this Peter hasn’t been too Yankee-fied.Indeed, despite the fact that the film’s director is Will Gluck (an American whose prior film was the 2014 “Annie” remake), the mode of cheeky humor here is reasonably British. There are at least a handful of inflections of Aardman, the renowned British stop-motion animation studio, in this picture. The scene in which Peter, his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, and his neurotic sidekick Benjamin Bunny travel to London on a mission to find a crucial human character recalls Aardman’s “Shaun the Sheep Movie,” from 2015. Let me be clear, though: “Shaun the Sheep Movie” is an animation masterpiece, while this film is … not. For one thing, it leans pretty heavily on the convention of “comedic scenes scored to jumpy ‘classic’ rock songs.” But its story line is clean; the live-action actors, particularly Rose Byrne (as Bea, an artist who paints portraits of the bunnies), bring their onscreen-appeal A game; and the computer-generated animals are charming, albeit lacking in the particular gentle winsomeness of Potter’s originals.With movies such as these, the most pertinent immediate question is, “Will the kids like it?” I don’t have any myself, but for the press screening I was able (with an actual parent, mind you) to host three, between the ages of 5 and 7. These were pretty sophisticated kids, as you tend to find in the tristate area. One of the 7-year-olds, on learning that I had a fear of heights, asked me if I’d ever seen “Vertigo.” They enjoyed the movie pretty quietly, and over pizza afterward, enthusiastically compared notes on their favorite scenes. Your results may vary."

But the movie exemplifies how small judgments in pace, performance and soundtrack can transcend modest trappings.Much of the credit is due to the film’s charismatic, tone-perfect lead, Lena Hall, who won a Tony in 2014 for “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” She plays Becks, a Brooklyn guitarist and singer who follows her girlfriend (Hayley Kiyoko) to Los Angeles — only to catch her with another woman.Becks goes to live with her mother, Ann (Christine Lahti), a former nun, in the St. Louis area. Ann is still working on embracing her daughter’s sexual orientation, and it’s a measure of the movie’s nuance that they never quite reach an accord. Unsure of what’s next, Becks performs in a bar run by a friend (Dan Fogler) and offers guitar lessons — though her only pupil is Elyse (Mena Suvari), the wife of a man Becks knew in high school as a bully.That Becks and Elyse will become more than friends is a predictable development, but the movie makes it persuasive by taking its time. Perhaps recognizing their biggest asset, the directors, Elizabeth Rohrbaugh and Daniel Powell, allow Ms. Hall’s numbers to play out at length. (The songs are by Alyssa Robbins, the movie’s real-life inspiration, and Steve Salett.) If the screenplay perhaps backs itself into a corner, its irresolution feels true to life."
"5259","Entanglement","",0,"JEANNETTE CATSOULIS","Review: Suicidal Man Seeks Mystery Woman for ‘Entanglement’","In this romantic comedy, Thomas Middleditch plays a suicidal man searching for the woman his parents almost adopted.

Sometimes, like Ben (Thomas Middleditch) in “Entanglement,” these sad specimens are permitted clinical passes for their weird behavior; but whether in need of restraints, medication or simply a decent barber, they are almost always presented as desirable romantic partners.Let’s go with that, then. “He’s not good in a crisis,” Ben’s father informs us, though a montage of botched suicide attempts has already established Ben’s misery bona fides and general ineptness. His wife has skedaddled, but his nosy neighbor (the delightful Diana Bang) is eager to clean his house and enable his quest to track down the woman who was once almost his adoptive sister. Like the wiring in Ben’s brain, it’s complicated.Impressively photographed and perkily paced, Jason Filiatrault’s story never droops quite as much as its lead character, injecting a welcome poignancy that tempers the cuteness. And Mr. Middleditch (star of the smart HBO comedy “Silicon Valley” and those grating Verizon commercials) is blessedly low-key, dialing down the neuroses and allowing his director, Jason James, to control the increasingly sanguine mood.Yet the job of rescuing the movie from a well of cartoonish whimsy falls on the gifted Jess Weixler as Hanna, the mystery woman who gives Ben the eye and a reason to live. Pert and pretty and smart-mouthed, Hanna is intriguing and a little dangerous — the splash of vinegar that counters the sugar. That she would give Ben the time of day is more than enough notice that all may not be as it seems."

Ms. Cummings also stars as Dr. Julia Brizendine, a newly divorced neuroscientist who observes brain activity as a way to study gender. While Julia uses work to dodge dating, her long-married study subjects, Lisa (Sofía Vergara) and Steven (Deon Cole) have become more platonic than romantic. In Julia’s other case studies, Lexi (Lucy Punch) can’t stop nit-picking her boyfriend, Adam (James Marsden), and Zoe (Cecily Strong) has let professional stress seep into her marriage to a basketball player, Greg ( Blake Griffin of the Detroit Pistons.)As the couples stumble through their daily frustrations, the film occasionally pauses to overlay a brain chart on the action, lighting up the glands and lobes Julia deems responsible for their behaviors. According to Julia’s funny phrenology, Lexi criticizes Adam’s hair and skin because her pituitary gland releases endorphins when she grooms, and Lisa adjusts a dangling bedroom mirror because her amygdala registers fear faster than Steven’s.“The Female Brain” is a fictionalized adaptation of a nonfiction book of the same title by the neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine. Armed with scientific conviction, the movie pits men’s minds against women’s with no room for overlap, and no room for those identities that exist outside the male and female categories. With tender performances and dubious conclusions, this story is best appreciated as an explanation for why people seek out the false comfort of gendered pseudoscience. But by fitting characters into formulas, “The Female Brain” fails to observe the flexibility of human experience."

This year there are plausible rationalizations for all five.The front-runner is probably Elaine McMillion Sheldon’s “Heroin(e),” which bears the imprimatur of Netflix, the company that took this statuette last year with “The White Helmets.” The most visceral of the nominees, it addresses an issue in the news — the opioid epidemic — with present-tense reportage and an eye toward putting human faces on the crisis.The movie follows three women combating the proliferation of drugs in the heavily affected city of Huntington, W.Va. The filmmakers trail Jan Rader, who becomes the city’s fire chief, on tense overdose calls, and sit in the courtroom of Judge Patricia Keller, who speaks to the recovering addicts before her with the patience of a parent. Necia Freeman hands out food to addicted prostitutes.At 39 minutes, “Heroin(e)” sprawls; each thread could sustain longer-term treatment. In sheer scope, the movie is likely to overshadow Thomas Lennon’s “Knife Skills,” though Mr. Lennon’s film will attract anyone eager to gawk at mouthwatering food. It follows the first class of trainee workers at Edwins, a Cleveland haute cuisine restaurant committed to hiring the formerly incarcerated, with the hope of preventing their returns to prison.Police brutality is front and center in Kate Davis’s powerful “Traffic Stop,” which revisits the violent arrest of Breaion King, an African-American teacher in Austin, Tex., flagged by an officer for a traffic violation. The movie combines the dashcam footage of the arrest with Ms. King’s reflections on the incident. The biographical details, meant to warm the heart and stoke outrage, feel superfluous. (A violent arrest would be a violent arrest even if Ms. King weren’t a model citizen.)2018 Oscar Nominations: Full BallotSee this year’s Oscar nominees and make your picks.Jan. 23, 2018“Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405” tells the story of Mindy Alper, who spent her life grappling with mental illness, and emerged as a successful artist. The director, Frank Stiefel, draws on Ms. Alper’s artwork for visual flair, but the film is a bit of a slog.“Edith+Eddie,” from the Chicago documentary house Kartemquin Films, simply offers a moving portrait. The director Laura Checkoway watches compassionately as the title characters — a Virginia couple who met when splitting a lottery ticket and married in their mid-90s — are separated because of squabbling family members and an indifferent bureaucracy.

But this year, “Dear Basketball,” which the retired N.B.A. star Kobe Bryant conceived, executive-produced and narrated, drew some #MeToo movement disapprobation when it was announced as one of the five nominees for the 90th Academy Awards. On social media and elsewhere, a 2003 sexual assault case against Mr. Bryant (which was later dismissed) was cited as a reason not to honor the movie. But the content of this short is unobjectionable on the surface. Directed by Glen Keane, the movie is an autobiographical sketch in which Mr. Bryant thanks basketball — both the object and the game — for the life he devoted to it. The animation, rendered in modes of pencils and pastels, has a gorgeous fluency to be sure. The score is by none other than John Williams, American cinema’s king of the Heroic Theme. Ultimately, “Dear Basketball” is substance-free, an advertisement for itself. It deserves to not receive an Oscar for that reason alone.Three of the other shorts are not without their pleasures. “Lou,” a Pixar short directed by Dave Mullins, sees the anthropomorphized contents of a schoolyard lost-and-found box teaching a lesson to a bully. The premise is a stretch, but Pixar’s tech mastery and imaginative chops were made to render such stretches into good cartoons, and this is one. “Negative Space,” directed by Max Porter and Ru Kuwahata, is realized in exquisite stop-motion animation. An adult reminisces about how his father taught him to efficiently pack a suitcase; the childhood memories yield to a chilly present-day and a road trip to a farewell. “Revolting Rhymes” is a BBC adaptation of Roald Dahl’s cheeky revisionist fairy-tale poetry book. A wolf (superbly voiced by Dominic West) regales a baby sitter with the real lowdown on Red Riding Hood and Snow White, with couplets including “Then this is the disgusting part/the Queen sat down and ate the heart.” The computer animation here yields a fun variety of facial caricatures for the beloved figures being deconstructed.2018 Oscar Nominations: Full BallotSee this year’s Oscar nominees and make your picks.Jan. 23, 2018The really outstanding nominee is “Garden Party,” directed by a French collective of six that calls itself Illogic. It’s a simple narrative in which a few animals, mostly amphibious — a tree frog and a bullfrog among them — trudge out of water and down from branches into a mysteriously deserted mansion. The mastery of computer animation here is staggering. The rotting food in the kitchen that the animals snack on is a vivid metaphor for human overconsumption, and the reason for the house’s desolate state is both horror-movie grim and mordantly funny. Watch out for Illogic — these artists are sure to be heard from more decisively in the future."

His attack, apparently inspired by ISIS, was thwarted by the bravery and quick thinking of several passengers, notably three young American tourists: Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone.Their heroism is at the center of Clint Eastwood’s new movie, “The 15:17 to Paris,” a dramatic reconstruction as unassuming and effective as the action it depicts. Based on a book written (along with Jeffrey E. Stern) by Mr. Sadler, Mr. Skarlatos and Mr. Stone, the film stars them, too.The practice of casting nonprofessionals in stories that closely mirror their own experiences has a long history — it’s a staple of Italian neorealism, the films of Robert Bresson and the Iranian cinema of the 1990s — but it remains a rarity in Hollywood. Usually the most we can expect is a poignant end-credits glimpse of the real people our favorite movie stars have pretended to be for the previous two hours. After all, part of the appeal of movies “inspired by true events” is the chance to admire the artistry of actors (like Tom Hanks’s, say, in Mr. Eastwood’s “Sully”) as they communicate the grit and gumption of ordinary Americans in tough circumstances.But the thing to admire about “The 15:17 to Paris” is precisely its artlessness. Mr. Eastwood, who has long favored a lean, functional directing style, practices an economy here that makes some of his earlier movies look positively baroque. He almost seems to be testing the limits of minimalism, seeing how much artifice he can strip away and still achieve some kind of dramatic impact. There is not a lot of suspense, and not much psychological exploration, either. A certain blunt power is guaranteed by the facts of the story, and Mr. Eastwood doesn’t obviously try for anything more than that. But his workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving. Its radical plainness is tinged with mystery.ImageRay Corasani as Ayoub El Khazzani.CreditWarner Bros.Who exactly are these guys? They first met as boys in Sacramento, which is where we meet them, played by Cole Eichenberger (Spencer Stone), Paul-Mikel Williams (Anthony Sadler) and Bryce Gheisar (Alek Skarlatos). Alek and Spencer, whose mothers (Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer) are friends, pull their sons out of public school and enroll them in a Christian academy, where they meet Anthony, a regular visitor to the principal’s office.Frustrated by the educational demands of both church and state, the boys indulge in minor acts of rebellion: toilet-papering a neighbor’s house, swearing in gym class, playing war in the woods. They are separated when Alek moves to Oregon to live with his father and Anthony changes schools, but the three stay in touch as Anthony attends college and Alek and Spencer enlist in the military. Spencer, stationed in Portugal, meets up with Anthony in Rome, and Alek, who is serving in Afghanistan, visits a girlfriend in Germany before joining his pals in Berlin. They go clubbing in Amsterdam, wake up hung over and, after some debate, head for Paris.To call what happens before the confrontation with the gunman a plot, in the conventional sense, does not seem quite accurate. Nor do Spencer, Anthony and Alek seem quite like movie characters. But they aren’t documentary subjects, either. Mr. Eastwood, famous for avoiding extensive rehearsals and retakes, doesn’t demand too much acting. Throughout the film, the principal performers behave with the mix of affability and reserve they might display when meeting a group of people for the first time. They are polite, direct and unfailingly good-natured, even when a given scene might call for more emotional intensity. In a normal movie, they would be extras.And on a normal day, they would have been — part of the mass of tourists, commuters and other travelers taking a quick ride from one European capital to another. At times, Spencer, the most restless of the three and the one whose life choices receive the most attention, talks about the feeling of being “catapulted” toward some obscure destiny. But “The 15:17 to Paris” isn’t a meditation on fate any more than it is an exploration of the politics of global terrorism. Rather, it is concerned with locating the precise boundary between the banal and the extraordinary, between routine and violence, between complacency and courage.The personalities of the main characters remain opaque, their inner lives the subject of speculation. You can wonder about the sorrow in Alek’s eyes, about the hint of a temper underneath Spencer’s jovial energy, about Anthony’s skeptical detachment. But at the end of the movie, you don’t really know them all that well. (You barely know Chris, a British passenger who helped subdue Mr. Khazzani, at all. He is seen but not named.)Producing the illusion of intimacy is not among Mr. Eastwood’s priorities. He has always been a natural existentialist, devoted to the idea that meaning and character emerge through action. At the end of “The 15:17 to Paris,” a speech by former President François Hollande of France provides a touch of eloquence and a welcome flood of feeling. But the mood of the film is better captured by Mr. Skarlatos’s account of it, published in news reports after the attack: “We chose to fight and got lucky and didn’t die.”"

Ryan Coogler directs a cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong’o.","2018-02-06","2018-02-16","2018-03-06 17:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/movies/black-panther-review-movie.html,Read the New York Times Review of Black Panther,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/arts/07black-panther1/07black-panther1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"A jolt of a movie, “Black Panther” creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore: myth. Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one. Its axis point is the fantastical nation of Wakanda, an African Eden where verdant-green landscapes meet blue-sky science fiction. There, spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls, touching down in a story that has far more going for it than branding.Wakanda is home to Black Panther, a.k.a. T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the latest Marvel hero to leap off the comic-book page and into his own movie. Created in 1966 by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art), the original Black Panther — a hepcat in a slinky suit with claws and ears — debuted alongside the Fantastic Four in an adventure in Wakanda, which is powered by a mystery metal, vibranium. It was a splashy, timely entrance (the revolutionary group that shares his name officially formed that same year), and by the end of his first escapade, the Four had assured T’Challa “there’s no reason for the Black Panther’s career to come to an end!”In the decades since, Black Panther has undergone a variety of costume alterations and adventures in the comics, some under the direction of the filmmaker Reginald Hudlin and, more recently, the author Ta-Nehisi Coates. To direct the first Panther movie, Marvel tapped Ryan Coogler, who with his last outing, “Creed,” shook the dust off the Rocky series by giving it an African-American champion played by Michael B. Jordan. For “Black Panther,” Mr. Coogler brought back both Mr. Jordan and some former crew members — including Rachel Morrison, the director of photography on his first feature “Fruitvale Station” — continuity that may help account for this movie’s intimacy and fluidity.As with all Marvel screen ventures, the story has a lot of moving parts, but in general the results don’t register as the same-old superhero busywork, the kind that makes for forgettable stories and strenuously overinflated running times. Written by Mr. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, “Black Panther” brings T’Challa’s story up to the present, sketches in his past and looks to his future, all while clearing room for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its other unitard-wearing warriors. (Black Panther was first wedged into the forgettable “Captain America: Civil War.”) The movie also rather too breezily establishes Wakanda as a militaristic monarchy that is nevertheless fair and democratic.The story initially involves a satisfying if obvious cartoonish villain, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis, having a conspicuously very good time), an underworld arms dealer with a weaponized arm, an Afrikaans sneer and a rampaging cohort that includes Erik Killmonger (Mr. Jordan). As his name announces, Killmonger has, well, issues to go with his striking body ornamentation. The band’s evildoing ways attract the attention of the Black Panther and an international lawman in the person of a friendly C.I.A. agent (the customarily cuddly Martin Freeman), whose good-guy status is just one reminder that “Black Panther” adheres to at least some dubious Hollywood conventions.For a while, as the story and the Black Panther veer here and there, jumping from Wakanda to Busan, South Korea, the filmmakers seem as if they’re simply going to deliver a remix of James Bond with a touch of Spidey shenanigans. The Black Panther even slinks into a swank casino with some backup and before long the place has erupted with the kind of choreographed mayhem that — as legs and gowns twirl — achieves liftoff. There’s also the inevitable chaotic car chase that turns Busan into a video game and, dispiritingly, a car commercial, an egregious tie-in that is somewhat alleviated by the amusing image of a woman warrior’s bare foot putting pedal to the metal.VideoRyan Coogler narrates a sequence from his film featuring Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther.Published OnFeb. 15, 2018CreditCreditMarvel/DisneyFlourishes like this (along with an amusingly airborne wig and, later, rampaging rhinos) and the Wakandan backdrop give the action scenes kick and actual personality, but Mr. Coogler’s directing strengths are more intimate. There are sequences in “Black Panther” that may make you cry because of where they go and what they say, but also because of the sensitivity he brings to them. He makes some savvy story choices too. And so, before Mr. Serkis can steal too many scenes, Mr. Coogler turns his attention to Killmonger and pushes the movie in another direction, away from a white villain wronging black people to black people living their lives.Part of the movie’s pleasure and its ethos — which wends through its visuals — is how it dispenses with familiar either/or divides, including the binary opposition that tends to shape our discourse on race. Life in Wakanda is at once urban and rural, futuristic and traditional, technological and mystical. Spaceships zoom over soaring buildings with thatched tops; a hover train zips over a market with hanging woven baskets. In one of the most striking locales, an open-air throne room is horizontally lined with suspended tree limbs, creating a loose pattern that pointedly blurs the divide between the interior and exterior worlds and is echoed by the fretwork in costumes and other sets.The rejection of the either/or divide extends to Killmonger, whose emotional, fraught back story gives the movie more heft and real-world friction than any of Marvel’s other superhero blowouts. Like a lot of adventures, “Black Panther” turns on a familiar father-and-son drama — there’s an assassination, a power vacuum and a somewhat reluctant heir — a patrilineal intrigue that is filled in here with intense face-offs involving questions of ancestry, identity, the African diaspora, the new world and the old. One particularly moving narrative thread features Sterling K. Brown, a tremulous, vibrantly sensitive actor who conveys entire chapters of grief. (He could out-weep Juliette Binoche.)Mr. Jordan is a terrifically charismatic presence and there are times when you wonder if he might have made a better Black Panther. Mr. Boseman’s magnetism is more slow-burning and his performance is more physically restrained than Mr. Jordan, even deliberate, though he has his splashier, freewheeling moments, including some hand-to-hand grappling. (Wrestling is big in Wakanda, hence a few sexy smackdowns featuring acres of bare skin and jumping muscle.) Like many other Wakandans, he speaks in English with a South African lilt, an accent that vividly summons up Nelson Mandela and suggests that T’Challa will soon be assuming the role of international diplomat.ImageDanai Gurira, in action as the general of Wakanda.CreditMarvel/DisneyIt’s important to the movie’s politics and myth-building that he is surrounded by a phalanx of women, among them a battalion of women warriors called the Dora Milaje. These aren’t moviedom’s irritatingly token strong chicks, the tough babes with sizable biceps and skills but no real roles. For all his father issues, T’Challa is enveloped by women who cushion him in maternal, military, sisterly and scientific support. A female general (Danai Gurira) stands by his side; his baby sister (a vivacious Letitia Wright) provides gadgets and withering asides à la Bond’s gadget guy. Angela Bassett swans in as the royal mother, while Lupita Nyong’o, as a spy, makes the case for her own spinoff.Buoyed by its groovy women and Afrofuturist flourishes, Wakanda itself is finally the movie’s strength, its rallying cry and state of mind. Early on, a white character carelessly describes it as “a third world country — textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.” Part of the joke, which the movie wittily engages, is that Wakanda certainly fits that profile except that its shepherds patrol the border with techno-wizardry, and its textiles and costumes dazzle because of the country’s secret vibranium sauce. More critically, having never been conquered, Wakanda has evaded the historical traumas endured by much of the rest of Africa, freeing it from the ravages of both colonialism and postcolonialism.Race matters in “Black Panther” and it matters deeply, not in terms of Manichaean good guys and bad but as a means to explore larger human concerns about the past, the present and the uses and abuses of power. That alone makes it more thoughtful about how the world works than a lot of mainstream movies, even if those ideas are interspersed with plenty of comic-book posturing. It wouldn’t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully."

One soon sees why: Despite the typically elevating presence of Helen Mirren, this super-silly feature (the fifth from the Australian brothers Peter and Michael Spierig) stubbornly resists being classed up.Set in 1906 and inspired by actual events (liberally sauced with myth and legend), the story centers on the eccentric Sarah Winchester (Ms. Mirren, grimly determined), heiress to the rifle fortune and eager dabbler in architecture and spiritualism. Believing that she has flourished on the deaths caused by her late husband’s invention, Sarah atones by constructing a vast and ever-changing mansion, whose hundreds of rooms are intended to imprison evil spirits or encourage benign ones to move on.Enter Dr. Price (Jason Clarke), a psychologist hired by the Winchester company’s board to count Sarah’s marbles and report back. Conveniently addicted to laudanum, Dr. Price is soon staggering around the labyrinthine structure, besieged by generic scares: a creepy butler, a rattling armoire, a child in the grip of milky-eyed possession. The Hogwarts-like domicile might be swarming with staff and construction workers, but not until Price arrives do the spirits hit the fan.Written by the Spierigs and Tom Vaughan, the script is as batty and clichéd as its heroine. The house (you can take a tour of the real one in San Jose, Calif.) never feels like a single space, as ho-hum apparitions appear and disappear without a trace. Ms. Mirren and her representatives are probably hoping the movie will do likewise."

(It was completed under the supervision of one of his sons.)It opens on the painting “Hunters in the Snow,” one in a series of seasonal landscapes by Pieter Bruegel the Elder dating from 1565. On the left side of the canvas, a group of men and dogs can be seen walking near people clustered close to a fire and a line of buildings; the right side of the painting shows a smattering of structures in the near distance and, beyond these, still more distant people skating and milling about on lakes of dark ice. Over the next few minutes, the painting begins to stir as smoke streams from a chimney, snow falls, a dog urinates against a tree and crows caw and fly.The addition of these modest sounds and movements is intriguing but adds no insight and certainly no beauty to the Bruegel, which needs no such interventions. The rest of “24 Frames” is more appealing. It consists of 23 segments that turn Kiarostami’s own photographs, many in starkly beautiful black and white, into animations of about four and a half minutes. Filled with desolate vistas, a feathered and furred menagerie, and multiple aperture-like windows, these fragments quickly establish a moody tone and over time become dolorous refrains. Each section is divided by fades to black and individual titles (Frame 2, Frame 15) that create a kind of countdown effect.A fine-art photographer as well as a filmmaker, Kiarostami could set your heart to leaping with cinematic landscapes that sometimes linger longer than his stories: a rough, dusty hill delineated by a zigzagging path in “Where Is My Friend’s House?”; two travelers motoring through a swaying field in “The Wind Will Carry Us.” It’s no surprise then that the images in “24 Frames” are consistently pretty and at times striking, harmoniously composed and filled with visual tension that make the shots vibrate even before something — birds, horses, an unfortunate deer or an opportunistically placed cat — starts moving in them. Many of the views are organized around an obvious center point, a leafless tree or bush, for instance, roughly set in a brilliantly white wintry expanse.At other times, Kiarostami flattens the picture, turning it into a stack of horizontal wedges. In one frame, a slab of darkly brooding sky seems to loom down on a skeletal railing that runs across the shot, cleaving it in half. Beyond the railing, water (ocean, sea or lake) surges and, with a bird, gives the image a frisson of drama. Repeatedly, a movement — a bird raising its head, a horse its hooves — turns an image into a tidy narrative fragment. Every so often (a watery panorama with a balustrade, tall poles and complaining gulls), the compositions seem to nod at Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese filmmaker to whom Kiarostami dedicated “Five” (2003), another experimental work.“24 Frames” can’t help but be affecting because it is Kiarostami’s final movie. But it’s intellectually uninvolving, and its technical limitations prove frustrating. In a few shots, snow or rain falls, for instance, on the same left-to-right diagonal, creating a distracting pattern that suggests the software wasn’t altered for each photograph. This synthetic quality may be an intentional imitation of life; certainly it’s obvious that Kiarostami was thinking a great deal about cinema. Intriguingly, while winter and all it implies loom large here, they are gently offset by a glimpse of the film “The Best Years of Our Lives” playing on a computer as the sounds of a deeply unexpected love song fill a lonely room."

In 2014 the group made an album called “Acoustic,” which featured them playing conventional instruments rather than samplers and decks. In this film, the group tours in support of that and similar work with a large retinue of singers and instrumentalists, culminating in a gig at the Hollywood Bowl.Their music here, largely downbeat but relentlessly anodyne, is not to my taste. During the song “On My Way to Heaven,” Cobi, a vocalist for the touring band, looks to his right and proudly says “Ladies and gentlemen, Jono on the Rhodes,” and Jono Grant, a member of the core trio, plays an electric piano solo that I think I first heard in the lounge of the Las Vegas Hilton in 1989. Still, Above & Beyond’s audience, a not insubstantial one, seems unfailingly moved by its work.Everyone in the group gets along with each other, and with everybody else. The movie, directed by Myles Desenberg and Paul Dugdale, frequently counts down to the Hollywood Bowl show as it chronicles rehearsals and other tour stops, but there’s no real suspense, because the footage from that show is interspersed throughout the movie from the very beginning, and the show seems to have gone off without a hitch. The movie is slightly prone to such fallacies, starting with the title. If you’re making your living creating music and you adjust your instrumentation, that’s not really giving up your day job. But this will not likely bother the movie’s intended audience: Above & Beyond fans for whom this film can serve as a kind of cinematic Snuggie."

The aliens, I mean, who can’t seem to resist the impulse to invade Earth and wipe out humanity. “Before We Vanish,” Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s witty science-fiction chin-scratcher — less a horror movie than a series of musings on potentially horrifying ideas — addresses the question literally. It concerns a reconnaissance squad of space travelers sent to do fieldwork in our ways and habits, with particular emphasis on our mental concepts.There is a long and rich tradition of debate in philosophy and cognitive science about the nature of those entities, which the three main aliens resolve with impressive practical acumen. For them, to acquire a concept is to steal it from the person who explained it, a theft that is consummated by a brisk tap on the forehead. The victim crumples to the ground (there are some variations on this procedure) and then resumes life missing a key piece of mental furniture.The result is not always terrifying. A manipulative, sexually-harassing boss, robbed of “work,” capers across the desktops of his office, laughing and tossing paper airplanes. A young man who has lived for a long time as an anxious shut-in loses “home” and finds himself free to explore the world and embrace political causes. It almost seems as if the aliens do their unwitting hosts a favor. The catch is that they plan to exterminate us and take over the planet.It’s not always easy to know whom to root for. The first invader we encounter (Yuri Tsunematsu) has taken the form of a uniformed schoolgirl, whose bloody introduction evokes, teasingly and somewhat misleadingly, the iconography of classic Japanese horror. She is joined by a young man (also an alien, played by Mahiro Takasugi) who has latched onto a cynical journalist (not an alien, played by Hiroki Hasegawa) who serves as a guide. Alien etiquette apparently discourages harvesting your guide’s concepts, and the two are refreshingly forthright about their identities and intentions. Not that anyone believes them, at least at first.Meanwhile, Narumi (Masami Nagasawa) is dealing with a mysterious change in her husband, Shinji (Ryuhei Matsuda), whose body has been taken over by one of the extraterrestrials. Their marriage was unhappy before, and now it passes through an even rougher patch on the way to a charming and not altogether surprising transformation. Once he learns enough to stop stumbling around in a semi-stupor, Shinji turns out to be an improvement over his earlier self. He’s open-minded. He pays attention. He listens to his wife.So the real question, as it tends to be in dystopian science fiction, is whether we will learn, or whether it’s too late for us to recover the value of the concepts that define us. Mr. Kurosawa, a prolific and skilled genre master, spins this parable with a light, nimble touch, punctuating heavy passages of exposition with punchy, modest action sequences and snatches of incongruously bouncy music. There is a decided air of pastiche — a predigital, low-budget, ’80s feel — and the right measure of sincerity to remind you why the concept of the alien-invasion movie is one that matters to the species."

It tells of a cheerful, underemployed scholar, Ho Yunqing (Shih Chun), who makes a meager living as a copyist. Soon after the movie opens, he is entrusted to copy a Buddhist sutra (a dialogue or sermon) that can liberate souls stuck in limbo. Ho isn’t a believer, but he needs the money and so enthusiastically heads out on a seemingly simple mission, one that eventually leads to an isolated outpost where curious and curiouser things occur.Filled with lovely natural landscapes that have been meticulously framed and photographed, “Legend of the Mountain” is often a visual ravishment. (It was shot in the South Korean countryside.) There’s a mesmerizing appeal to many of its panoramas, with their variegated colors, dense vegetation and drifting, swirling white mist. And while King Hu certainly likes to move the camera — it sweeps, swoops and sometime breaks into a near-run — he also likes to linger on images as if encouraging you to admire their compositional harmony. You can get lost in these pictorial reveries as you trace the rays of light piercing the trees, brightening the dark waters and the reality-softening haze.Despite being warned away by a stranger, Ho at last makes it to the outpost, where a story of sorts emerges, along with allies and other figures who prove more sinister. Mysterious women (the equally charismatic Hsu Feng and Sylvia Chang) come and go, as does an enigmatic lama (Ng Ming-choi) with an open, cherubic face and splendid yellow vestments. There are digressions and some wonderful visual fillips — beautifully curved trees and noble stone statues lined up like soldiers. All these attractions are a necessary balm given that Ho turns out to be a deeply uninvolving character (Mr. Shih mostly smiles, grimaces or looks amazed), a wan placeholder for a character in a narratively thin film that runs over three very leisurely hours.A giant of Chinese cinema, King Hu (1932-1997) is best known for his wuxia films (“A Touch of Zen”), martial arts stories involving heroic deeds, quests, swordplay and the supernatural. “Legend of the Mountain,” a 1979 film that has been restored to the director’s cut, is more wuxia-adjacent though it does feature some fight sequences in which characters go fantastically airborne, defying gravity with bounce and somersaults. Amusingly, the main choice of weapons isn’t swords but drums that opponents beat — with insistent, galloping fingers — to create a powerful, mystical sonic force. The drumming is wonderful and suitably hypnotic even if it doesn’t necessarily pull you under the film’s own spell."

In the first scene, Mr. Carman is 39, hardly a prime age for grappling. The question that emerges is whether he knows it’s time to call it quits.Mr. Unay often shoots Mr. Carman in wide screen at close range, emphasizing the physical strain of his routines, whether he’s running, training or doing mechanical work for a ferry system. Part of the secret of the movie’s interest is that Mr. Carman is not invincible or a former superstar. We’re told that he doesn’t even make money off cage matches.Yet the damage they do to his home life is real. “It’s the only time in my life when I feel proud of myself,” he tells dismayed family members who have just learned that he is fighting again, despite having promised his ill wife never to get back in the ring. Fighting, he says, allows him to feel that he likes himself. Mr. Carman is shown throughout the film as a loving parent (we see him dancing with his daughters and making them pancakes), but he can’t check his pride. Fighting means being in a cage in more than one sense.“The Cage Fighter” is hardly epic in scope or originality, but it is uncommon to watch this degree of open self-flagellation on screen. Mr. Carman insists to one of his daughters that having a black eye doesn’t count as being “hurt” and visits a doctor who wonders whether his symptoms indicate post-concussion syndrome. He appears in court when an ex-wife wants to relocate and sits stoically when the judge implies that he is the less dependable parent.“The Cage Fighter” is not riveting from moment to moment, but Mr. Unay allows the movie’s themes to click into place beautifully toward the end, when Mr. Carman shares a moment of rapport at a bar with a competitor — and learns, to his surprise, that his younger rival is every bit as mortal."

Adapted from Mr. Bocelli’s 1999 novel of the same name (a story he has described as “similar to” his own life), this blah trudge from cradle to stage will be catnip to his fans and Ambien to everyone else.Directed by Michael Radford (no stranger to corny, middle-of-the-road snoozers) with more attention to chronology than creativity, the story dallies so long in its hero’s leafy Tuscan childhood that we’re more than halfway through before anything resembling a singing career materializes. Before then, we learn about the glaucoma that rendered him virtually blind, the soccer accident that exacerbated the condition and the love of music set aside in favor of a law degree.Around him, primarily Italian actors gamely wrestle with thickly accented English dialogue, most of it hagiographic and all of it dull. The object of their admiration, meanwhile — here called Amos Bardi and played as an adult by Toby Sebastian — is a singularly bland talent, a mopey presence in cardigans and corduroy. Yet my sympathies are all with Mr. Sebastian: It can’t be easy to create a dynamic character when you’re unable to fully open your eyes.The filmmakers have no such excuse. Not until Antonio Banderas arrives to play Maestro, the crucial voice coach who knocks Amos into shape, does this metronomic slog to stardom muster a pulse. He’s too late to save the movie, but he’s just in time to stop us from nodding off altogether."

But those dreading 50th-anniversary greatest-hits medleys will find solace, enlightenment and surprise in João Moreira Salles’s “In the Intense Now,” a bittersweet, ruminative documentary essay composed of footage from the era accompanied by thoughtful, disarmingly personal voice-over narration.Some of the images — and virtually the only ones in color — come from Mr. Salles’s own archives. His family was living the expatriate life in Paris, traveling home to Brazil during vacations. His mother, an arts journalist, took a trip to China in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, filming ancient monuments, smiling schoolchildren and ubiquitous portraits of Mao Zedong.The Chinese interludes, along with amateur film from Czechoslovakia, punctuate a main narrative devoted to the “events of May” in France. That story, of a student uprising followed by a general strike, has been told many times before. The sights associated with it — of rioters hurling cobblestones at the police, of whimsical graffiti, of occupied factories and the imperious visage of President Charles de Gaulle — are as familiar as pictures of Woodstock or the moon landing. But Mr. Salles offers both fresh visual material and a gently revisionist interpretation of events.The story of May 1968 in France is partly the story of Daniel Cohn-Bendit — called Danny the Red for his hair and his radical politics — one of the celebrity militants of the time. He was the most charismatic of the student leaders, and an articulate spokesman for the concerns of a generation fed up with bureaucracy, conformity and a sclerotic political system.They forged an improbable, temporarily effective alliance with industrial workers, a convergence that many thought heralded a new revolutionary coalition. But Mr. Salles, with the benefit of hindsight and an astute ability to analyze the documentary record, throws cold water on this romantic notion. The witty slogans — “Be realistic, demand the impossible”; “The walls have the floor”; “Underneath the paving-stones, the beach!” — had the punch of advertising copy. The street demonstrations galvanized the news media and the intelligentsia, but the public craving for order and normalcy was deeper than they or the students realized. And while the students claimed to desire liberation from consumer society, many of the workers wanted better access to it.The Prague Spring was an unsuccessful revolution of a different kind, ended by the military intervention of the Soviet Union in August. In China, by contrast, the revolution appeared to be successful, but the full dimensions of its cruelty were not yet visible to the few visitors, like Mr. Salles’s mother, who were allowed into the country. Mr. Salles, who seems broadly sympathetic to the traditions of the international left (his brother is Walter Salles, director of “The Motorcycle Diaries”), nonetheless disdains the easy sentimentality of lost causes. He elucidates, above all, the ironic dimension of his film’s title, imposing an elegiac, gently pessimistic tone on the energy and immediacy of what he sees and shows.What he reveals, perhaps against his own intentions, is the inevitable aestheticization of the past. The anonymous demonstrators in Paris and Prague, and the people holding the cameras, were caught up in the drama of the present, rushing furiously toward a future they could not comprehend. Those of us living in that future notice their clothes and cigarettes, the beauty of the 8- and 16-millimeter cinematography, the look of cities before Starbucks and McDonald’s. For a few hours, we are caught up in the intensity of then."

So, please, it continues, don’t be offended or expect authenticity about a long list of things, right down to the dance forms.In other words, folks, it’s just a movie. Oh, and one more note: Ladies — the film does not in any way endorse ritual self-immolation.This everybody-please-relax nervousness is well earned. “Padmaavat,” the story of a Rajput (Hindu) queen whose beauty is so great that the sultan (Muslim) lays siege to her kingdom to possess her, has inflamed extremist Hindus since the movie was in production. Was history being honored? Was the queen? (She may or may not have actually existed.) The director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, was slapped on set and his hair was pulled; the lead actress, Deepika Padukone, was threatened with beheading or having her nose cut off.Before the movie was released, a few changes were made. They include the addition of that detailed disclaimer and a revised title, “Padmaavat,” which aligns more closely with the poem, but doesn’t match the name of the heroine, Padmavati.As the film stands now, no one need be concerned about the honor of Rajputs, as warriors or paragons of virtue. This movie is a love letter to all that.It’s also something of a bore: a lavish 3-D pageant with the depth of a children’s pop-up book. Those paragons, Padmavati (Ms. Padukone) and her king, Ratan Singh (Shahid Kapoor), dressed in gorgeous silks and bangles, are more heaven to look at than delightful to know.They meet epic-poem cute: Hunting deer in the forest with bow and arrow, Padmavati misses her target (or does she?) and instead hits Ratan Singh right in the ticker. Boom. He takes her to his kingdom and installs her as Wife No. 1. (A pre-existing wife gets a demotion and a few halfhearted jealousy scenes.)Soon, Allaudin (Ranveer Singh), a sultan conquering great swaths of India — Delhi is his latest acquisition — hears of Padmavati’s beauty. Because he must possess everything precious, he must have her. Epic battles ensue. And Padmavati is a death-before-dishonor type, so spoiler, she immolates herself when Allaudin breaches the fort.Allaudin is a comic-strip villain, half-pirate, half-sociopath, all swaggering id. At least Mr. Singh looks as if he’s enjoying himself — he gets to grimace, gnash his teeth and rip the greasy meat off bones like a monstrous Henry VIII.Which is to say: Mr. Bhansali is painting with a broad brush. One of Hindi cinema’s great stylists, he shows here, as he has in other films, a swooning fondness for the heightened look of movies and for the look of old India: forts and billowing tents and lovingly textured, color-coordinated interiors. The impact of all this care fades, though, if you watch the movie in 3-D, which accentuates the movie’s cartoonish qualities.Those qualities extend to the characters and the story. As Padmavati reminds us near the end, it is nothing more than a tale of good vs. evil.That could be fine — a slog, sure, but one with plenty to look at. As the movie proceeds, though, it becomes grimmer and more unpleasant, its fealty to spectacle increasingly tethered to violence and death. Which brings us back to the real world.It is Hindus who have been protesting “Padmaavat,” mostly sight unseen; this week, before it opened, Hindu women threatened mass suicide in honor of Padmavati’s sacrifice. But, because the story can only get more perverse, the movie’s ugliness is in its portrayal of Muslims — the villain, Allaudin, and his army — not the Rajputs.With the exception of a bad-seed Brahmin, the Rajputs are covered in glory here: Every action is a right action; their leaders, Padmavati and Ratan Singh, are models of beauty and refinement. The movie’s Muslims, on the other hand, eat dirty, fight dirty and follow the lead of a marauding brute who dishonors his own wife. It may be cartoonish but it’s also dispiriting."

Opening with a quotation from Leo Tolstoy’s last and bleakest novel, “Resurrection,” this wittily animated feature from the Chinese writer and director Liu Jian presents a generic, follow-the-money tale as a Darwinian commentary on ruthlessly modern materialism.The stolen bag of moola moves briskly from one grasping hand to another, yet the movie’s images are often strangely static. For seconds at a time, the only movement in the frame might come from a single, flashing light on empty train tracks or a blinking neon sign in front of a deserted factory. These lone blips of vivid color emphasize the palely anemic sweep of industrial blight around them, the grubby gray storefronts and trash-lined streets where characters scheme for easy enrichment and a leg up to otherwise impossible dreams.Zhang (voiced by Zhu Changlong), the initial thief, needs to pay for a redo of his girlfriend’s botched plastic surgery. Yellow Eye (Cao Kou), a depressed hit man, wants start-up cash to finance a career as an inventor. Sundry underworld types scratch and sniff in pursuit, but their harebrained motives — like the money itself — are mere tools with which to paint a pitch-black picture of Chinese economic frustration set against the allure of Western opportunity.Chatty to a fault, these gangsters rarely kill without preamble, declaiming everything from philosophy to Fauvism and Buddhism to Brexit. The voice actors rise to the occasion, often portraying multiple emotions in a single, ruminative monologue. The story that frames them is thin, but the animation has a style and restraint all its own, its clean precision and curiously flat aesthetic ensuring our focus on words as well as deeds.Speckled with present-day politics and musings on global capitalism, “Have a Nice Day” conjures a small-town landscape of pitiless greed. A marriage proposal is rebuffed, its bearer left unconscious on the roadside while his beloved drives off with their ill-gotten loot. Earlier, we’ve seen the owner of the money coolly torture a childhood friend, even as he fondly reminisces about their shared formative experiences. Cars crash and characters are repeatedly bonked on the head, every brutality erupting on a canvas that’s studiously devoid of affect.In a setting this dismal, sex seems a nonstarter, though a hardy few peddle repurposed animal carcasses as procreative aids. “Works better than Viagra,” one peddler assures his mark, proffering a wild turtle. Even killer-entrepreneurs sometimes need a little help to get the job done."

I should actually say “subjects.” As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski’s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we’ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski’s adult son, Tomasz, will live. At this point Tomasz is already struggling with mental illness.Beksinski himself, while a painter of apocalyptic, sci-fi landscapes, is a cheerful, sardonic sort. He’s perhaps a little too bluff about Tomasz’s condition. Discussing their son with his wife, he notes, “At least he’s not running around with a razor, threatening to slice up his grandmas.” Tomasz, who is present, retorts, “I only consider knives and razor blades in relation to my own wrists.”Entering the camcorder age, the Beksinskis become relentless chroniclers of their own lives. The director, Jan P. Matuszynski, mixes simulated home-video footage with stealthily virtuosic long-take scenes, including a remarkable one depicting an airplane excursion with Tomasz. The tragedies in this family’s life are nearly constant, but Mr. Matuszynski approaches them with a tone that’s matter-of-fact while also partaking in the particular wry irony that has been a hallmark of Polish cinema since the early 1960s."

Lou Adams, the head coach, trains his athletes in the gym and pleads with them to avoid trouble outside it: We see neighborhood memorials to young men killed in gun violence, and learn that more than 20 people in the community died during the time the documentary was made.Tyquone Greer and Marquise Pryor, two star players, have visions of college careers, but the call of gangs and parties often proves too seductive. The director Dustin Nakao Haider follows them as they navigate their days and nights, on and off the court.Though the premise is familiar — see “Hoop Dreams” or any of the countless feature films about youth sports — the excitement still stays high when the games begin. At other times Mr. Haider records his subjects without comment; no one here is prodded to overexplain. This director isn’t afraid of silence, and he’s prepared to let a quiet moment speak for itself. Attentive viewing is required, and rewarded.A late scene in “Shot in the Dark” finds Tyquone and Marquise looking back on their pasts and their relationship with Coach Lou. Their conversation is brotherly and poignant, and leaves much unsaid. That talk is like the film itself, which gives us tough truths on the screen, while knowing there’s still more under the surface."

At the opening of the new film, Mr. Gitai somewhat pretentiously likens his role to that of an “archaeologist” of negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.This episodic documentary jumps back and forth in time, mainly between 1994, when Mr. Gitai filmed an interview with Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli prime minister, who was assassinated a year later, and 2016, when Mr. Gitai surveys the aftermath of the stalled peace process that Rabin fought for.In the Rabin interview, the prime minister explains to the filmmaker how he reached the decision to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and argues for the necessity of social and economic development with Arab partners to secure a lasting peace. Other footage from 1994 — some shot in Gaza and at a checkpoint on the Israeli-Gaza border — is presented as a reminder that the past was not all that different from the present.Through interviews with Israeli politicians, and Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank, “West of the Jordan River” gives voice to peace-seeking residents on both sides of the conflict. The journalist Ari Shavit, who wrote for the newspaper Haaretz before resigning after being accused of sexual harassment, says that if settlement construction continues, Israel will be forced to choose between abandoning its status as a Jewish state or abandoning its status as a democracy — a recipe for national suicide.Mr. Gitai, who frequently cuts to himself listening, or interrupts his subjects with questions and counterarguments, comes across as a determined if smug guide. “Nothing is more solid than the coalition of those who oppose peace,” he says at one point, but he does find signs for optimism. He films an association of Israeli and Palestinian women who have lost loved ones to the conflict and feel united in their bereavement. And in a rather on-the-nose closing note for the film, he shows Israelis and Palestinians playing backgammon together."

Adapting his second book (“Eddie Krumble Is the Clapper”), Mr. Montiel — a former punk musician whose memoir, “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,” was filmed in 2006 — fails completely to transform sad-sack characters into interesting ones.Instead, he presents them as borderline dolts, barely functioning adults defined by behavioral quirks and psychological soft spots. Eddie (Ed Helms) and his buddy Chris (an unusually restrained, possibly mortified Tracy Morgan) are bottom-feeding actors in Hollywood whose specialty is playing audience members on low-budget television shows. Clapping and hollering on cue — and sometimes, if they’re lucky, asking a prearranged question — they survive with minimal income and even less ambition.Theirs is a livelihood that depends on blending into the crowd. So when Eddie’s ubiquity is spotted and exposed by a late-night television host (Russell Peters), he becomes a running joke and essentially unemployable. The notoriety also threatens to derail his painfully dimwitted pursuit of Judy (Amanda Seyfried), a sweetly simple gas-station cashier with a fondness for weird humans and wounded animals.Mashing limp romance and artless satire into a ludicrously contrived plot, “The Clapper” lurches from one mirthlessly eccentric scene to another.“Sometimes at night it feels like all the normal people just disappear,” Judy says, wistfully. Sometimes in movies it feels exactly the same way."

And in Ben Lewin’s “Please Stand By,” that sometimes brittle vulnerability serves her well as Wendy, a young woman with autism who dreams of leaving her group home in San Francisco and living with her married sister and baby niece. Yet despite her commitment to the role — and the generally fine supporting performances — this timorous tale sidesteps uncomfortable realities in favor of soothing whimsy and preordained uplift.There’s nothing wrong with choosing cute over challenging, but it feels condescending to those on the spectrum and insulting to audiences who might prefer not to be cosseted. Wendy herself is a completely credible character: bright and forthright, she holds down a minimum-wage job at Cinnabon and retains an encyclopedic knowledge of “Star Trek.” Observing how the ultrarational Spock processes the emotions of his human colleagues helps her negotiate her own relationships, watched over by her motherly therapist, Scottie (Toni Collette).The story spun around her, though, is a fairy tale of tentative independence with every edge buffed smooth. Rather than investigate, say, why Scottie’s devotion to her patients seems to have alienated her teenage son — or address the painful realities of protecting infants from tantrum-prone relatives — Michael Golamco’s script (adapted from his one-act play) sends Wendy off on a picaresque journey to Los Angeles. The competition deadline for her original “Star Trek” script is looming and mild misadventures lie in wait.It’s all very comforting and credulity-testing: even the kindly police officer she encounters (Patton Oswalt) is able to calm her down in Klingon. I’ll leave it to dedicated Trekkers to vouch for his accent, but I think Lieutenant Worf would probably approve."

Oblivious to occupying the pop-culture equivalent of the bottom half of a double bill, “Maze Runner: The Death Cure” aspires to be a grand male weepie: the “Shawshank Redemption” of “Maze Runner” movies.The first film — like all the entries, adapted from a novel by James Dashner — had a pleasing unity of place and action. (Amnesiac boys attempted to escape from a giant maze.) The draggier sequel, “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” (2015), added scale by sending the characters on the run. While “Maze Runner: The Death Cure” continues the trend toward supersizing, at least it moves.“The Death Cure” opens with a spectacularly staged train rescue indebted to “Mad Max: Fury Road.” It continues with a few too many zombies; the return of a character presumed dead; a lot of sneering from an Ahab-like security officer (Aidan Gillen); a class revolt that’s essentially window dressing; and some of the most homoerotic bromance in a mass release since the “Lord of the Rings” films.But as silly as they sound, these movies are pretty well made, capable of outsize action and teary intimacy. The director, Wes Ball, knows how to move his camera around a futuristic medical compound, and the filmmaking brio — especially the sights of Earth’s last city, shot in Cape Town — mitigates the eye rolls prompted by the plot.“The Death Cure” picks up soon after “The Scorch Trials.” The aforementioned train rescue saves a large group of children held captive by WCKD, which harvests the young seeking a cure for the zombie virus, but it fails to retrieve Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Thomas’s buddy since the maze. And Thomas (Dylan O’Brien), as ever, won’t leave anyone behind.Poor Brenda (Rosa Salazar) persists in appearing to pine for Thomas, but he still carries the torch for the traitorous Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), now an assistant to the WCKD’S chief Machiavellian (Patricia Clarkson). Thomas reserves most of his emotion for Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), whose immunity to the virus comes into question, prompting an outpouring.Gally (Will Poulter), resurrected with an almost comical lack of fanfare, is the only character with a sense of humor. Still, it’s hard to accuse a movie with a rescue by airborne bus of excessive self-seriousness."

His one nonstandard-issue eccentricity is an attachment to an ancient cellphone, which contains Josie’s last voice mail message to him. On a New Orleans tour stop, he learns of the death of his best friend in nearby Saint Augustine, the town from which he bailed. On impulse, he heads there.While the Prodigal Son of scripture returned home after working out a heartfelt plea of forgiveness, Liam just shows up. Are there hard feelings? Sure, but they’re the softest hard feelings you’ve seen in any work of fiction, or nonfiction, ever. Also turns out that Josie, as fresh and lovely as ever, has an adorably precocious moppet of a daughter, Billy, whom she has named after Liam’s long-deceased mother.Forever My Girl | Official Trailer | Roadside Attractions | In theaters January 19CreditCreditVideo by RoadsideFlixThere is no talk of potentially seven years worth of unpaid child support; no mention of formalizing any sort of custody arrangement. This group must somehow form a family, as the “Brady Bunch” theme song says, and so it goes, with one dopey speed bump that presumes to explain and erase Liam’s damage. The rest is pure romance-novel wish-fulfillment. The director, Bethany Ashton Wolf, who adapted the screenplay from, yes, a romance novel by Heidi McLaughlin, can concoct some Hallmark-greeting-card-quality shots, but has little flair for piecing them together. The lead actors are very pretty."

That’s about the rate at which this surprisingly long, wildly ambitious, thoroughly ludicrous crime thriller delivers its own big scores.Itself a plundering of “The Driver,” the original “Point Break” and “Heat,” the movie is less concerned with the mechanics of police work than with the mind meld that forms between an obsessed cop, Big Nick (Gerard Butler), and his target, Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber), who leads a group of Marines turned bank robbers planning to crack a branch of the Federal Reserve.To catch them, Nick recruits a mole, Donnie (O’Shea Jackson Jr.) — a bartender who moonlights as a getaway driver — then inexplicably blows his own cover. Is there a reason, other than the writer and director Christian Gudegast’s desire for a stylish confrontation, for Nick to turn up when Merrimen is at the shooting range? In the funniest, most gratuitous tangent, a member of Merrimen’s crew played by Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent, has the others intimidate his daughter’s prom date.With almost compulsive detail, “Den of Thieves” rattles off title cards identifying places and major characters, some of whose names sound like Los Angeles suburbs. The would-be regional authenticity is marred by obviously off-location work. It’s no surprise when the ubiquitous Georgia peach logo surfaces in the credits.Still, the film is generous with action and twists, even if some don’t track. For January, a month Hollywood reserves for dogs, this is an admirably weird movie."

It opens under a pall on the morning of Sept. 11. Mitch Nelson (Mr. Hemsworth), a Special Forces officer, has just moved into a new home with his family and is watching the twin towers burn on TV. Soon, he and his team are choking on dust in Afghanistan, where references to the Alamo mix with the spirit of John Wayne jingoism.There’s a story here, but first and foremost there are men. Tough, hard-bodied, soulful men, the kind who, in volcanic frustration, will slam hands as big as Easter hams against walls and who can — as Mitch does while idling in a military office — flip over a desk as lightly as if he were chucking a toy truck. Other hard-bodied men see his hurt, but as strong, discreet brothers they, too, keep their feelings in check. “Nice kill,” a comrade archly says, surveying the ruins of Mitch’s desk. “12 Strong” has just begun, but its world of masculine pain, private anguish and commitment to violence is already firmly in place.The movie shifts into a steady action groove once the not especially dirty dozen lands in Afghanistan. There, the Americans warily join forces with General Dostum (a charismatic Navid Negahban), a warlord who they hope will join them in their fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Dostum views Mitch with skepticism and favors his subordinate, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon). Hal, Dostum notes approvingly, has “killer eyes,” which Mr. Shannon certainly doesn’t disprove. Once Team USA and Team Afghan stop glowering and growling at each other, a posse hits the trail on horseback and Dostum and Mitch settle into a mentor-student bond that evokes the Karate Kid and the road to wisdom.ImageMr. Hemsworth leading a charge in “12 Strong.”CreditDavid James/Warner Bros.For devotees of cinematic blowouts and dedicated students of screen masculinity (like me), “12 Strong” is premium, Grade A catnip. Directed by the newcomer Nicolai Fuglsig, it is generally watchable, if unsurprisingly easier on the eyes than on the ears or brain. It’s well stocked with dependable actors and ornamented with swooping aerial shots of the severely beautiful landscape. (New Mexico stands in for Afghanistan.) There are pretty horses, echoes of heroic westerns and a halfhearted rendition — pitched between sincerity and irony — of “The Ballad of the Green Berets,” the gung-ho anthem that hit the charts in 1966, when the United States was on its way to losing the war in Vietnam.Winning and losing aren’t the point of “12 Strong,” and neither are politics, the present, the past, the United States or Afghanistan. Its reason for being is brotherhood, as belief and way of life. It sings of how men become warriors and of how they can reach across seemingly impossible divides to clasp hands and lock eyes before blowing their mutual enemy to pieces. And while Sept. 11 gives Mitch and his men their mission, the locals aren’t entirely ignored, not exactly. The motto of the Special Forces is “To Free the Oppressed,” a creed the movie underscores, most forcefully in a scene of a Taliban leader, Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), terrorizing a family that has educated its daughters.Still, while the movie largely elides overt politics and policies, both domestic and foreign, they are inextricably embedded in every single narrative turn, each word and image. (They’re also embedded in the credits: Like other movies of this type, “12 Strong” received technical support from the American military.) Written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig — and adapted from Doug Stanton’s well-received nonfiction book “Horse Soldiers” (2009) — the movie takes for granted that military action in Afghanistan is essential and justified. The filmmakers make that case mostly with images of Sept. 11 — cut to a man’s clenching fist — and through scenes and stories of the Taliban’s violence.The periodic references to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan suggest that the larger picture is, well, awfully complicated. Real complications, though, are for other movies. We’re now almost 17 years into the war of Afghanistan, the longest in American history. That’s a deeply sobering marker but one that has no place in “12 Strong,” which starts as a recruitment ad before settling into a tense, unremittingly brutal combat movie. Mr. Fuglsig’s contribution to this basically well-coordinated mayhem — which includes fiery explosions, a Bruckheimer trademark — is hard to gauge. It also scarcely matters when bodies rise and fall to a beat as natural as our circadian rhythms."

It goes without saying that Gioia Tauro, a beaten-down zone of poverty and petty crime, is no place for such a noble animal. “When we were on the road, we were free,” says Pio’s grandfather — glimpsed as a young man in a brief opening scene — who watches his descendants struggle to hold onto the old ways of their wandering, proudly ungovernable kind.“A Ciambra,” the second feature directed by Jonas Carpignano (the first was “Mediterranea,” also set in Gioia Tauro), follows Pio’s lurching movement toward manhood and observes his environment with a sympathetic, probing eye. The film, named for the battered apartment complex where Pio lives, provides fresh evidence of the continued vitality of the neorealist impulse as it tries to embed a fictional narrative in the actual world. It has the shape of a fable and the texture of a documentary. The actors are nonprofessionals playing versions of themselves. During the end credits, the frame is filled with more than a few dozen Amatos, Pio’s onscreen (and Mr. Amato’s real-world) family.Kinship is the defining — and also the confining — fact of Pio’s life. Home is a hive of siblings and cousins, presided over by Pio’s mother, daughter of the semi-mythic grandpa. Pio trails after his older brother, Cosimo (Damiano Amato), playing the familiar role of sidekick, mascot and occasional annoyance. The younger boy is a natural watcher, a close student of the ways of his elders, eager to emulate them even when he doesn’t quite understand what’s going on.After Cosimo is arrested, Pio tries to fill his shoes and apply the lessons he has absorbed. He steals luggage, ransoms stolen cars to their owners and contemplates bigger scores. He is cunning, though not always smart, and like many adolescents he vacillates between wild overconfidence and childlike naïveté. He knows how to drive a car, but not how to read. He goes wherever he pleases, but is afraid of elevators and trains. He is rarely without a cigarette, a habit that apparently begins among boys in his family shortly after they’re out of diapers. Mr. Amato’s brooding man-child features and skinny frame give physical expression to Pio’s in-between, half-formed state.The story, which emerges slowly through the warmth and noise of Pio’s daily life, leads him toward a wrenching moment of moral crisis. In its mood and methods, “A Ciambra” pays homage to the work of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the living masters of European realist cinema. Like the protagonists in their films, Pio faces an ethical dilemma created as much by his own misjudgments as by the harshness of his circumstances. He is forced to decide, before he is ready and at enormous potential cost, what kind of person he wants to be.I hesitate to say too much more, since like the Dardennes (and like their great precursor, Robert Bresson), Mr. Carpignano uses the character’s agonizing choice as a way to create suspense. “A Ciambra,” which numbers Martin Scorsese among its executive producers, shows some of his influence as well, in its depiction of crime as a family business and in its attention to masculine codes of loyalty, violence and respect. The most frequent visitors to Ciambra are the police and the gangsters known locally as “the Italians,” who come to dispense assignments and collect payment. It seems inevitable that Pio will end up in trouble with one or the other.His best friend outside the family is Ayiva (Koudous Seihon), an immigrant from Burkina Faso who serves as a surrogate big brother while Cosimo is locked up, and who is nicer to Pio in any case. He is also the boy’s guide — and the viewer’s — to a world of refugees and migrants that is both similar to that of the Roma and distinct from it. Both groups exist at the margins of Italian society, despised, pitied and ignored, but they experience that marginality, and their own uprootedness, in ways that reflect radically different histories.To put the film’s central problem in political terms, Pio is forced to choose between solidarity and identity, between friendship and blood, between universalism and tribalism. His grandfather’s horse may represent a dream of freedom, but freedom is not a word with a single, fixed meaning. Mr. Carpignano has a shrewd sense not only of the character’s psychology, but also of the audience’s expectations, and our tendency to confuse realism with magical thinking."

As such, a film that might once have seemed too big for its breeches — slow, cryptic, overly enamored of complicated camera movements and crepuscular compositions — probably looks better than it did then, a necessary step in the evolution of a major filmmaker.The Banishment (Izgnanie) - Teaser TrailerCreditCreditVideo by despair78The plot pivots on a test of a marriage. Vera (Maria Bonnevie) tells Alex (Mr. Levronenko) that she is pregnant with a child that’s not his. Alternately violent and tender, Alex agonizes over what comes next. Mark (Aleksandr Baluev), his brother and confidant — a shady character who, at the film’s start, seeks Alex’s help with the removal of a bullet — is indifferent by temperament. (He tells him, “Whatever you do will be right.”)The first two-thirds are an extraordinary slow burn that provides ample time to admire Mr. Zvyagintsev’s talent with the wide frame. The movie is marred by an unsatisfying resolution, which has a coyness better suited to literature. Adapting “The Laughing Matter,” a 1953 novel by William Saroyan, Mr. Zvyagintsev has untethered the story from place (California in the book) and time, but the psychological conceits are in some ways dated."

Exiled to the care of her great-aunt while her parents attend to some unspecified business, Mary is a bored, lonely, curious child, and therefore a perfect candidate for a fantastical adventure. Shunted aside by the grown-ups and mocked by the only other young person in the rustic village of Red Manor, a cute boy named Peter, Mary soon acquires a black cat, a broomstick and a cluster of enchanted purple blossoms.Based on “The Little Broomstick,” a durably popular novel by Mary Stewart, and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, “Mary and the Witch’s Flower” is a charming children’s entertainment that sometimes seems to have been genetically engineered from other such entertainments. The rustling forests and voluptuous clouds recall the work of Hayao Miyazaki, and Mary herself shows an obvious kinship to the young witch in “Kiki’s Delivery Service.” (Mr. Yonebayashi worked as an animator on several of Mr. Miyazaki’s films.) Mary also resembles both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, especially once she makes her way to a school of magic called Endor.One of the teachers there speaks in the voice of Jim Broadbent, who played Professor Horace Slughorn, a member of the Hogwarts faculty in a couple of “Harry Potter” movies. Lack of originality is not a crime, though, and children’s literature is an art of recombination perhaps more than of invention. Children are comforted by familiarity as much as they are enchanted by strangeness, and “Mary and the Witch’s Flower” has enough of both to hold the attention of young viewers.Endor is an appealingly weird mix of medievalism and science fiction, presided over by an imperious headmistress voiced by Kate Winslet. The plot is packed with incidents and surprises, and Mary is an admirable character, full of pluck and decency and prone to the usual anime expressions of loud amazement.Adult fans of the genre — or of the Harry Potter chronicles — will find the movie perfectly tolerable, and might treat it as a gateway for the more sublime pleasures of Mr. Miyazaki’s best work. Mr. Yonebayashi, an able disciple, so far lacks the master’s visual majesty, his attunement to the mysteries of nature and his ethical sophistication. The spell Mr. Yonebayashi casts is effective, but also ephemeral. It’s minor magic."

But the filmmakers are determined to sound a wake-up siren, and they blast it here with extra strength.The documentary, directed by Mick McIntyre and Kate McIntyre Clere, begins with a look at the kangaroo and its place in Australian culture: It’s both a widely used mascot and, to some, a hallowed creature.But the animal is considered a pest by farmers and ranchers, and a profit source by pet-food companies and leather processors. Meat exporters are rushing to build a market for human consumption of this marsupial in China and Russia. The filmmakers scrutinize processing plants, where carcasses are butchered by the trailer-load, and deride the Australian government, which they suggest is mismanaging the populations.“Millions of kangaroos are slaughtered every year in Australia to provide meat for cats and dogs, and also for humans,” in what is the largest terrestrial wildlife killing anywhere on earth, one interviewee says.Videos taken during kangaroo hunts, in which adult animals are shot and dismembered, are horrid. In several scenes, babies are shown being pulled from their dead mothers’ pouches and bashed to death. It’s sickening to watch.To avoid a nonstop focus on bloodshed, “Kangaroo” occasionally offers up images of the outback and drone footage of wild animals in their habitats. Those can be breathtaking. Yet the filmmakers, to their credit, don’t flinch from stomach-turning sights. This film isn’t always pretty, but its message is necessary."

Why Mr. Barker thought it worth preserving Mr. Kerry’s “I’ve been very blessed to be able to go through a progression of experiences which underscore the value of experience” sound bite is a mystery. There’s some juice in Mr. Rhodes’s reaction, more bruised than angry, to a profile in The New York Times Magazine, in which he is portrayed as finding the Washington press corps both ignorant and credulous.

I sing the truth.”Even so, it’s hard not to wish that the Finnish director Mika Kaurismaki’s primer on Ms. Makeba (1932-2008) had a stronger point of view. Like many biographical documentaries, it resembles a lengthy highlight reel of crucial events from its subject’s life, without much in the way of style or perspective.Ms. Makeba’s life was, of course, more than eventful enough to sustain a movie. “Mama Africa” remembers her appearance in the film “Come Back, Africa” and performances with Harry Belafonte; her 31-year exile from South Africa after the apartheid-era government revoked her passport; her anti-apartheid activism before the United Nations; her marriage to the black-power activist Stokely Carmichael (a union that’s said to have caused concerts in the United States to be canceled because of controversy surrounding Mr. Carmichael); and her return to South Africa following Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.Mr. Kaurismaki (a brother of Aki Kaurismaki, who made the recent “The Other Side of Hope”) includes the tributes of family members and former musical collaborators. More crucially, he has considerable footage of Ms. Makeba in concert and in interviews.

For instance, in an early scene, little Josh taunts the family’s Asian housekeeper by referring to her as “Charlie,” the derogatory nickname American soldiers called the Viet Cong, and — get this! — she gives back as good as she gets, crabbily shooting back, “I am Chinese. Chinese is not Charlie.”Ugh. Anyway, “Mom and Dad” soon reveals its high concept: All the parents in its world go mad and try to start killing their kids. The writer and director Brian Taylor shies away from no possibility here, including a delivery room scene in which a woman begins crushing her newborn. As you can imagine, the homicidal frenzy gives Mr. Cage plenty of opportunity to go full him, which, in this case, doesn’t yield as much fun as you might have hoped.Mr. Taylor was half of the directing team, with Mark Neveldine, responsible for some hilariously crass and irrational movies such as “Crank” and “Crank: High Voltage.” I presume that Mr. Neveldine was the funny one of the duo, because absent his input, Mr. Taylor offers up nothing but glitchy editing and bad vibes."

Instead, common cultural character emerges from dozens of disparate sketches. As if he were assembling a collection of Russian scary stories, the director Dmitrii Kalashnikov makes the bizarre beguiling.Early on, a dashboard camera captures a green light as it burns across the horizon. The men who witness the light as they’re driving debate if they’ve seen a comet or a crashing plane, but on video the flash looks alien, like a probe from a foreign and hostile universe. Even when the danger turns out to be terrestrial in nature, “The Road Movie” always retains this same senseless strangeness. With every cut to a different camera, a surreal episode unfolds with a new menace. A couple drives through a forest fire so hot, the flames appear purple.

Without explanation, a man jumps on the hood of a stranger’s car, beating the glass first with his fists and then with his head.Perhaps strangest still is that throughout the bedlam, the drivers rarely betray their shock. They are under constant siege, but the only crack in their collective stoicism is the reliance on cameras to capture the chaos. The camera offers no protection; it only provides a witness. Fortunately for audiences, it’s more pleasurable to witness anarchy than it is to experience it."

Divided into clear, concise chapters and conducted in a style that might be called street-corner Ken Burns, this documentary, directed by Manfred Kirchheimer, is more essay than epic, preferring coherence to comprehensiveness. In looking at a smattering of buildings in two big cities, and focusing on the work of a handful of major architects, Mr. Kirchheimer sketches the skyscraper as a feat of engineering, a work of imagination and part of an ongoing cultural argument.All of a sudden, toward the end of the 19th century, it became possible to conceive of ordinary urban commercial and residential buildings whose height would surpass the limits of human stamina. The invention of the modern elevator by Elisha Graves Otis was crucial, and so was the development of iron and steel frames that enabled lighter, higher and slimmer constructions. As often happens (see also: the internet and the automobile), technological advances created aesthetic challenges. What were these gigantic new buildings supposed to look like?""Tall: The American Skyscraper & Louis Sullivan""CreditCreditVideo by Contemporary Arts Media - ArtfilmsOne answer: like the old buildings, only bigger. Mr. Kirchheimer associates this idea with Daniel Burnham, the Chicago planner and architect who is in some ways the villain of “Tall.” Burnham, whose legacy includes the grounds of the World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 — part of the backdrop of Erik Larson’s true-crime historical best seller “The Devil in the White City” — adapted ornate European styles to new uses and proportions.Burnham’s foil, and Mr. Kirchheimer’s hero, was another Chicago architect: Louis Sullivan, a brilliant draftsman and theoretician often identified as the father of the modern skyscraper. (“Tall” comes with the subtitle “The American Skyscraper and Louis Sullivan.”) Famous for declaring that “form must ever follow function,” Sullivan tried to find an organic, authentic identity for modern tall buildings. While hardly averse to ornament, he envisioned each structure as a dialectic of utility and beauty. His great disciple, Frank Lloyd Wright, would extend Sullivan’s philosophy in his own writings and architectural projects.That philosophy is understood in “Tall” to be quintessentially American, partaking of the same democratic spirit that breathes in the writings of Emerson and Whitman. Sullivan appears as a prophet without much honor in his own country, denied the celebrity and the lucrative commissions enjoyed by the Europe-besotted Burnham.According to Mr. Kirchheimer (whose lucid and erudite narration is read by the actor Dylan Baker), the glass-and-steel boxes of the post-World War II International Style are part of Burnham’s legacy rather than Sullivan’s. “Tall,” though it was completed in 2006, ends its story several decades earlier, before the advent of postmodernist styles that might have complicated its tidy argument. But the film is useful in part because it is so frankly argumentative. The critical appreciation of art is always advanced more effectively by partisanship than by neutrality.ImageA cruise ship passing by the World Trade Center in this undated image from Mr. Kirchheimer’s film, which incorporates vintage postcards, photographs and architectural renderings.CreditCinema Guild/Streetwise FilmsAnd good criticism often exists in a state of tension with itself. “Tall,” with its graceful, thrifty camera work, is a profoundly beautiful film, and its beauty is sometimes at odds with its polemical intentions. Its form, you might say, departs at times from its function. There are sequences that seem intended to emphasize the ugly, alienating qualities of skyscrapers that ignore or distort Sullivan’s principles. But those rows of blank windows and unvarying girders and columns, the unadorned stone carapaces and glass skins, take on their own sublimity.This may be because they are more pleasing than Mr. Kirchheimer supposes. Or it may be that his own Whitmanesque spirit — evident in earlier films like “Stations of the Elevated” and “Canners” — cannot help but endow everything it beholds with aesthetic dignity and interest. He communicates his enthusiasm effortlessly, so that you leave “Tall” with an awakened intellect and wide-open eyes."

The directors and brothers Eshom Nelms and Ian Nelms have obviously made a study of the genre, both in its old and more recent iterations, and while they’re happy to play around with the form, they pretty much leave the basics intact. By far their smartest, most inspired move is to have cleared room for John Hawkes, one of those actors who are more often seen nibbling at the edges of a scene, leaving perfect little teeth marks that sometimes give a movie its primary texture.Mr. Hawkes plays Mike Kendall, a former cop. He lives alone in a Utah town in nice house with a white picket fence that he’s flattened, doubtless after a hard night. He’s halfheartedly looking for work, but all he seems to want to do is drink and pal around with his brother-in-law (Anthony Anderson). So Mike drinks and drinks some more, tossing back beer until he staggers, stumbles and blacks out. He doesn’t seem otherwise affected by his prodigious consumption and, for some reason, the filmmakers seem amused by it. He looks healthy enough, even when lifting weights between sips.One morning, Mike finds a badly beaten woman (Stefania Barr) near a field that he’s slept in after another soused night. She’s an enigma and soon his possible redemption, a sacrifice to the story gods that lets him play lawman again. With a cheap business card and an equally cheap jacket and tie, he smilingly ambles it into the shamus role, knocking on doors and sniffing out leads among all the yammer and serviceable visuals. Before long he is chasing down a familiar dark tale of very young women and very bad men, and trading patter with both a silky rich cat (Robert Forster) and a smooth pimp (Clifton Collins Jr.), who rolls up with a scowl, pummeling first, asking questions later.The supporting players slide into their types just fine, though for the most part they remain little more than satellites orbiting Mike or, rather, Mr. Hawkes. Even Octavia Spencer, who plays Mike’s sister and, as a performer, can overpower her scenes, never manages to wrest even the tiniest corner from Mr. Hawkes’s firmly relaxed grip. The Nelmses don’t make enough of their more intriguing ideas (Mike’s familial history) and end up right where you expect they would, bang bang. But Mr. Hawkes keeps you tethered, whether he’s navigating the movie’s uneven tones or peeling down one of cinema’s lonely highways in a muscle car so lovingly shot it deserves a co-star credit."

As they are preserved in museums, his installations can seem like mere debris strewn across a floor. The highly praised 2017 film “The Square” contains a running gag about an art work that’s nothing but piles of rocks, which keeps getting swept up by the cleaning staff of a museum; it’s clearly a poke at Beuys.As is the case with many conceptual artists, Beuys’s work was best understood with Beuys’s actual presence attached to it. But Beuys has been dead since 1986. This documentary, directed by Andres Veiel using mostly archival footage, makes a strong case for Beuys, emphasizing the social conscience at work in his art more than the postmodern prankishness.Beuys (pronounced “boys”), whose thin, high-cheekboned face never seemed to age (as a German pilot in World War II he was wounded more than once, perhaps necessitating plastic surgery; the film implies as much) almost always sported a fedora as he made pronouncements like “Anything can be art, especially anything that conserves energy.” As both performance artist and art teacher, he often comes off as a happy warrior: “Give me a place to stand and I’ll move the earth.”But the film chronicles the crippling depression and isolation that Beuys suffered in the 1950s as he struggled to formulate his voice. His drawings from that time, the only really “traditional” art he accomplished, are harrowing, haunting. Even if you don’t need Beuys justified or explained to you, the movie is an exhilarating portrait of a unique truth-teller."

Henson, as the title character, showers, dresses, puts on makeup and selects a bright blond wig from her wardrobe. Oh, and she also selects a formidable-looking handgun from the formidable arsenal behind her wardrobe.After which she goes on her mission, quickly dispatching a guy who barely gets a chance to gape at her wig. In a room elsewhere in the man’s apartment, she sees a young boy, headphones blocking his hearing, obliviously playing a video game. This gives her pause.But she doesn’t intervene in the kid’s life, not just yet. Instead, a year goes by, and Mary discovers the kid, Danny (Jahi Di’Allo Winston), is a runner for a Boston drug dealer referred to only as Uncle. After discovering the boy wounded and starving in an alley, she takes an unorthodox approach to adoption, rubbing out Uncle in a flash of anger.“Proud Mary,” directed by Babak Najafi from a script by Steven Antin, John Stuart Newman and Christian Swegal, is a rather more somber affair than other movies in the same tradition. Although the plot mechanics are no more or less implausible than any such genre film. Mary is a hit woman for one drug cartel, Uncle was an operative for a rival one, and the scenario eventually spirals into a minor morass of misidentified killers and lethal paybacks.But Ms. Henson, ever simmering, takes Mary’s moral conundrum very seriously. Her expressive eyes and nuanced body language work well for the character; she can put across a major change in attitude just by shifting a hip. The script, though, doesn’t give her a whole lot of material with which to credibly enact her character’s crisis. Her exchanges with Benny (Danny Glover), the drug kingpin who took her under his wing, or with Tom (Billy Brown), Benny’s son, heir and an ex of Mary’s, provide some idea of a potentially richer movie.By the end, “Proud Mary” is of course obliged to hew to the prerogatives of its genre, with a warehouse action sequence scored to a Tina Turner version of the title song. The over-the-top nature of the sequence (Mary’s car gets shot up enough it could double as a sieve) is not served well by Mr. Najafi’s execution. The C.G.I. bullet holes that dot the various boxes and crates on the set look like bad Photoshop."

The New York teen, played by Luka Kain, has delicate features and carries an air of quiet about him. He and his younger brother will now be looked after by both their mother Amara (Margot Bingham) and strict Aunt Rose (Regina Taylor). The latter does not mince words after Ulysses is discovered trying on his mother’s shoes. “If I ever hear of you even looking at women’s clothing, I will beat it out of you. You are a man. Start acting like one,” she says, enunciating each word with controlled rage.But the boy is in no way conflicted about his sexual orientation — he’s just surrounded by disapproval. As a form of escape, he imagines his life as a musical, and the movie is dotted with song and dance, beginning with a particularly audacious locker-room scene in which Ulysses’ jock tormentors turn into backup dancers. For real-life affinity, Ulysses seeks companionship on the pier by Manhattan’s Christopher Street, where he is enlisted into Saturday Church, a program for at-risk L.G.B.T.Q. youth. (The program in the movie is based on a real one.)The film was written and directed by Damon Cardasis, making his feature debut. It is a disarmingly and consistently sensitive movie that remains engaging even when its reach sometimes exceeds its grasp. (A musical number set in what might be the world’s tidiest homeless shelter doesn’t quite make it.) The wonderful cast brings the story home, and Mr. Kain in particular is a real find. When Ulysses first puts on lip gloss in a room full of people who accept him, the smile that plays on his face is both ebullient and heart-rending."

Do people get funnier with age?Sam Hoffman, who founded the website Old Jews Telling Jokes, which was adapted into a book and an Off Broadway show, built a franchise that might persuade you that they do. His comedy avoids the fashionable confessional style in favor of borscht belt standards about hectoring mothers and religious figures walking into bars.He has worked on movies for years, but his directorial debut, “Humor Me,” a lightly amusing stroll down some well-worn streets, shares a sensibility with his popular site, with narrative tacked on. It could be called: Middle-Aged Jew Not Telling Jokes.It begins with a terrible day for a sad-sack playwright, Nate Kroll (Jemaine Clement). He loses his job. His wife leaves him for a French billionaire, and — conveniently, for the purposes of the plot — he doesn’t realize his lease is up. This forces him to move in with his father, Bob (Elliott Gould), in a retirement community. In an odd-couple scenario, Nate is self-serious, while his dad can’t stop joking. Nate meets a fellow midlife-crisis sufferer, Allison, a thin role played winningly by the singer Ingrid Michaelson, and agrees to stage a production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Mikado” with older women. Working on this show embarrasses him, but besides being an opportunity for more comic moments from senior citizens, this humble effort inevitably leads to an epiphany.Among such old-school plot mechanics is one novel element involving re-enactments of jokes that act as a kind of Greek chorus while underlining a central theme: the power of jokes to bring people together and occasionally keep them apart.But don’t get the wrong idea: The movie never gets too deep, which is half of its charm. The other half involves the low-key comic performances by a stellar cast including Annie Potts and Bebe Neuwirth, who plays a theater producer named C.C. Rudin.Mr. Clements works wonders with a deadpan expression, imbuing his role with a repressed melancholy, a nice match for the poignant emotionalism of Mr. Gould’s Bob. Jokes matter to this old man, and he makes telling them seem like an act of vulnerability. One favorite is faking a heart attack, and when his son doesn’t laugh, Mr. Gould looks so wounded you worry he might really have one, suggesting a joke can kill even when it doesn’t."

A singular filmmaker, Mr. Garrel makes intensely personal films about love, family and intimacy that are filled with romantic agonies and beautiful faces made for close-ups. Often shot in luxuriant black and white, these are movies to swoon over, though how long you do so in “Lover for a Day” depends on whether you find its ideas about love, faithfulness, men and women charmingly old-fashioned, exasperatingly naïve or merely deterministic. As is often the case with other people’s reveries, you may not necessarily want to share in this one.The story involves a neatly constructed triangle that is almost parodically French, or perhaps just cinematically so: a 23-year-old woman, her doting father and his 23-year-old live-in girlfriend. Shortly after the film opens, Jeanne (Esther Garrel, the director’s daughter), flees to her father’s apartment. Distraught and nearly frantic, she broke with her boyfriend that very evening and is seeking refuge and comfort in her father’s insouciantly bohemian digs. It’s a bit crowded, what with all the books and his new girlfriend, but Gilles (Eric Caravaca) loves his daughter.Gilles also loves Ariane (Louise Chevillote), one of his students. A philosophy professor, he teaches at a school with atmospherically peeling walls that are ideal settings for sexual assignations, as you discover in the two scenes that effectively bookend the movie. In between, a great deal happens, mostly on an intimate level in modest rooms. In bedrooms and across tables, Jeanne, Ariane and Gilles pour out their hearts and reflect on love as they — word by word and with discreet and grand gestures — stake claims on one or another’s affections. Like chess pieces on a very small board, Ariane and Jeanne advance and retreat, even as Gilles remains more or less in place.ImageLouise Chevillotte, left, and Esther Garrel; Ms. Chevillotte plays the girlfriend of Ms. Garrel’s father.CreditMubi“Lover for a Day” beguiles the eye. Shooting in 35-millimeter black-and-white film, Mr. Garrel fills the wide screen with a ravishment of tones, from inkiest black to crystalline white and every imaginable gray in between. There’s a deceptive casualness to his visuals. Every image looks harmonious without being fastidious, which means that you see the picture rather than the intention. Yet even when you see the thought behind his images, the gentle disorder of his characters’ lives, with their patched walls and messes, creates an inviting informality that strengthens his realism. He’s a master of near-perfection, of dazzlingly lit and shot wisps of hair and tear-streaked cheeks.Quite a few tears splash down in “Lover for a Day,” which tracks Jeanne after she moves in with Gilles and Ariane. It’s a surprisingly smooth transition, or so the film insists. Mr. Garrel, who shares screenwriting credit with three others (including the veteran Jean-Claude Carrière), puts a lot of words into his characters mouths, not many of them persuasive. Soon after Jeanne arrives, she and Ariane talk about love, breeze past the fact that they’re the same age and quickly shift from the personal to the platitudinous. “You’ll get over it,” Ariane assures Jeanne about her breakup, “we always do.” When pressed on who she means, exactly, Ariane earnestly replies: “I mean every woman.”The solemnity of this exchange — with its lilting piano chords and the Raphaelite tranquillity of Ariane’s face — suggests that Mr. Garrel sincerely believes this about women, which would be fine if his characters were more convincingly individual. Yet even though each is given a moment (a near-suicide, one affair and then another), Jeanne, Ariane and Gilles stick to a disappointingly familiar script. While Jeanne embraces her role as the dejected, apparently unconscious daughter with daddy issues, Ariane plays the part of the free-spirited object of a rather different kind of paternal desire. Gilles, meanwhile, settles into the role of the obliging patriarch who’s hot or warm as needed.There are times when the characters — and their director — surprise and genuinely delight. In one heart-piercingly elegiac sequence, Jeanne and Gilles head off together, leaving Ariane behind. As he does elsewhere in the film, Mr. Garrel introduces this interlude with a lovely piano flourish and a few words from the intermittent narrator (Laetitia Spigarelli): “That evening, Gilles went out with his daughter.” The voice-over briefly suggests the start of a once-upon-a-time story, yet as Jeanne and Gilles walk and talk, the scene becomes something far more enchanting: two people whose unforced intimacy speaks to a bond that feels shaped by a shared history rather than clichés.And then Gilles asks, “What will you do with your life?” He and Jeanne have stopped walking, and, as they stand facing each other on a quiet sidewalk, you sense that something consequential is about to happen. They’re in long shot, the dark night holding them as if in an embrace. When Jeanne asks why Gilles cares, the camera begins quickly moving toward them, as if matching your desire to hear the answer. “Because,” Gilles says, his hands now gently cupping his daughter’s face, “I gave you that life.” Oftentimes in this film, the third in a Garrel trilogy that includes “Jealousy” and “In the Shadow of Women,” the characters merely speak words. Here, they — and you — feel them."

This in itself causes the slimy mooks to take umbrage, and as Mia (Melissa Bolona) is outside calling her fiancé (who is at a strip club, with Mia’s approval), they pull up in a van, pull her in, inject her with a potentially lethal drug, and take her to be prepared for human trafficking.But as they say in countless movie tag lines, these guys messed with the wrong family. Or words to that effect. In “Acts of Violence,” directed by Brett Donowho, Cole Hauser (whose father Wings Hauser livened up many low-budget action potboilers of this ilk a generation ago) plays Deklan, an anguished war veteran who happens to be the future brother-in-law of the kidnap victim. After receiving scant satisfaction from Bruce Willis’s well-meaning cop (the law has tied his hands, you see), Deklan enlists his brothers to find Mia and seize justice.This dopey action thriller harks back to grindhouse pictures of the ’70s and ’80s, although it’s too tasteful, if that’s the word, to consistently exploit the more lurid implications of its sensationalist scenario. Which I suppose speaks well of the filmmakers as people. But not that well. The picture moves at a brisk pace, though, and Mr. Hauser’s mostly cool and collected avenger is somewhat fun to watch."

The resulting movie, national in scope, lays out damning (if not always cohesive) arguments about how government regulators tend to defer to the companies they are supposed to supervise, how legislative fixes aren’t permanent and how mandated safety checks are useless if they aren’t performed or performed properly.Some compelling camera personalities emerge. Randy Huffman, at the time the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection in West Virginia, wants to “give the benefit of the doubt” to organizations. When Mr. Hoback, who has read a report suggesting that tens of thousands of violations of the Clean Water Act went uninvestigated in the state, cites that number to him, Mr. Huffman brushes it off as “not that many.”Dr. Rahul Gupta, who begins the movie as executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department and becomes the state’s commissioner of health and human resources, is presented as a dogged health advocate who is cowed as he rises in stature.Throughout the movie, Mr. Hoback looks for a smoking gun — a revelation that will explain pollution not only in West Virginia, but also in Flint, Mich. and elsewhere — and seems to think he finds one. But the problems appear systemic, tied to human nature and economics.Is “What Lies Upstream” persuasive in all respects? No. Will it make you think twice about what’s gone unnoticed in your tap water? Absolutely."

You can call him precocious, but in the case of Billy Bloom (Alex Lawther), who we first see quoting the Irish writer and dandy in a flashback recalling sunnier times in his childhood, that’s not enough.Born into great wealth, the hero of “Freak Show” initially rhapsodizes to the audience about his mother (Bette Midler, going big in her scant screen time), whom he calls “Muv,” praising her as “a living testament to grace, glamour and Gucci.” Life with Muv was sweet, but after she enters rehab, Billy must reside at the mansion of his father (Larry Pine), who’s not happy about Billy’s rejection of conventional masculinity.The kids at his new high school aren’t down with it either. Defiant, Billy wears Lady Gaga-style costumes to school, and is brutalized for his trouble. In his recovery, he forges an unlikely friendship with a football star (Ian Nelson). The movie finds its ostensible plot about an hour in, after Billy decides to compete with an evangelical classmate (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen. Laverne Cox can’t do a whole lot in her perfunctory role as a local TV news reporter covering the homecoming queen competition.Directed by Trudie Styler, making her fiction feature debut, “Freak Show” benefits from a vast array of talents both behind the camera (the cinematographer, for instance, is Dante Spinotti, a regular collaborator with Michael Mann) and in front of it. Mr. Lawther is sympathetic and appealing as Billy, but Ms. Styler seems to mistake broad strokes for stylistic daring, and her colorful but diffuse movie never jells."

A determined, mostly unobtrusive observer of China’s dispossessed, Mr. Wang works in a demanding mode of vérité, allowing scenes to play out at length and providing little in the way of exposition.His extreme running times often pay dividends. It’s hard to describe the feeling of relief when, after three hours of the nearly four-hour “’Til Madness Do Us Part,” the camera suddenly leaves the mental hospital. In “Bitter Money,” which runs more than two and a half hours, the duration seems less purposeful than the vestige of a film in progress. It’s not clear that the director quite found what he was looking for.Mr. Wang’s subject is the mass migration to Huzhou, where a boom in clothing manufacturing seems roughly comparable to the North Dakota oil rush in the United States. Residents from rural areas have gone to Huzhou for jobs. Mr. Wang documents the bustle on a crowded train to the city, though typically, he doesn’t provide statistical details until the closing title cards.Only some of the workers, filmed between 2014 and 2016, stand out. The most tense interaction occurs early, when a woman who has left her abusive husband returns to him seeking money. Mr. Wang films the resulting altercation in a 10-minute take, with his camera crouching outside a shop door like a voyeur. The director’s methods are open to ethical debate, but the power of his filmmaking, at its best, is not."

The best that might be said about “Abe and Phil’s Last Poker Game,” starring Martin Landau, who died in July, is that it might lead viewers to “North by Northwest” or “Ed Wood.”Mr. Landau plays Abe, a physician who moves into a nursing home with his deteriorating wife (Ann Marie Shea), an experience he finds humiliating. (In a tiresome motif, he insists on being addressed as “doctor,” not “mister.”) But Abe becomes fast friends with Phil (Paul Sorvino). Each might be the biological father of a nurse (Maria Dizzia) who knows only that her mystery dad lives at the home.“Abe and Phil’s” is the first fiction feature from its writer and director, Howard L. Weiner, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School who founded a center for multiple sclerosis. That’s noble work, and knowing of it provides context for the movie. The medical tidbits, however awkwardly presented, are the most distinctive aspects of the script. The flat direction, alas, is not the work of a filmmaker.The surprisingly many scenes devoted to Abe and Phil’s discussions of their potency (and their efforts to reignite it) mostly just play as embarrassing. The emphasis on the physical tolls of aging might be excused as a bold confrontation of tough truths. It’s as difficult to begrudge Dr. Weiner that effort as it is to watch the results."

The women’s working relationship sours under the pressure and they change too. Anti-depressants go untaken, frantic calls are left unanswered and two likable characters become unrecognizable. This jarring change from comedy to tragedy is unsettling, and, as “Dim the Fluorescents” languishes in the women’s bitter breakup, becomes tedious.Mr. Warth’s background as a film editor proves useful when bouncing between screwball-speed dialogue and deadpan reaction shots. He enhances the contrast between the women’s colorful apartment and the antiseptic business world as a visual punch line. Mr. Warth, who wrote the screenplay with Miles Barstead, creates a flawed tale of female friendship and the artist’s everlasting struggle.

That’s true despite the possessive adjective in the title, or the fact that the director, an artist, plays an artist, Ellie. Or even the fact that the filmmaker is Laurie Simmons, who, detractors might scoff, belongs to a family of oversharers. (Ms. Simmons’s daughter Lena Dunham appears briefly as one of Ellie’s former students.)Part of what seems to separate Ms. Simmons from Ellie is that Ellie is alone, with no children or partner except for a dog with bad hind legs. “My Art” can be read as a study of how her solitude helps and hinders her creativity.Ellie travels upstate to spend time by herself at a friend’s capacious summer home. Her latest project comes to involve re-enacting scenes from famous movies. She is helped by two gardeners (Robert Clohessy and Josh Safdie) who are frustrated actors, as well the father (John Rothman) of a student. They mimic scenes from “Some Like It Hot,” “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Misfits,” among others, making the point, to paraphrase Ellie, that it is impossible for any one performer to truly be another.Your feelings on “My Art” may vary depending on whether you find that idea compelling. “My Art” invests far too much in the conceit. (The re-creations look like unfunny “Airplane!” parodies.) Part of the problem is that Ms. Simmons has surrounded herself with more interesting actors, including a scene-stealing Parker Posey."

The dude can trade punches with guys half his age, roll out from under the wheels of a moving train and then jump right back onto the train. He doesn’t make it look easy. The whole appeal of Mr. Neeson’s late-career rebirth as an action hero is that it looks like hell.ImageVera Farmiga hatches a scheme in “The Commuter.”CreditInternet Video ArchiveDirected by the noted Neesonist auteur Jaume Collet-Serra (“Unknown,” “Non-Stop,” “Run All Night”), “The Commuter” for a short while promises to be something more than the usual barrage of fistfights, chases and grimaces. The opening title sequence, a montage of nearly-identical mornings in the life of Michael MacCauley, is a thing of beauty. Mike, who lives in Tarrytown, N.Y., awakens each day to ride the Metro-North Railroad train down to Manhattan. He kisses his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and banters with their teenage son (Dean-Charles Chapman). What could have been a sketch of Cheeveresque ennui is instead a brief and lovely survey of contentment.We know Mike’s happiness will be shattered, and the clouds that gather to darken his day are also, at least at first, pretty interesting. The MacCauleys lost a lot in the 2008 financial crisis, and they’ve been struggling to rebuild since then. Mike is abruptly laid off from his job selling insurance, and has a quietly foreboding encounter with colleagues from his previous job, which was with the New York Police Department. (Of course he’s a former cop. He’s Liam Neeson. His colleagues are played by Patrick Wilson and Sam Neill.) And then, on the hot, crowded ride home, Mike meets a mysterious woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga) who offers him $100,000 to identify another passenger, another stranger on the train.Until the particulars of Joanna’s scheme start to reveal themselves — roughly until the first fight sequence — Mr. Collet-Serra cultivates a clammy, hallucinatory, Hitchcockian vibe. Mike is a hapless patsy, but he has also been knocked off his ethical moorings by the prospect of financial ruin. He’s in a trap he can’t escape, and suddenly everything looks different. The familiar faces of fellow commuters, some of whom he’s ridden with for years, take on a sinister cast. Panic and paranoia waft in on the summer air.And then the mood is ruined. It’s not so much that “Commuter” reverts to form as an action movie — we expected as much — but that it does so with such weary contempt for its audience and its own better instincts. It’s not even very good as a genre exercise, and can’t always keep track of which genre muscles it wants to flex. For a while it’s a locked-room mystery. Then it’s a runaway-train thriller. Joanna’s conspiracy is so vast and preposterous that it becomes nothing more than a grab-bag of plot twists. As Mike pivots from moral ambiguity to righteous heroism, Mr. Neeson looks increasingly tired. I can’t blame him, though I guess I am a little bit mad after all."

Buchanan’s interference kicks off an adventure that sends Paddington through a trial, a prison sentence, an escape and a daring pursuit by train.But before the book becomes a plot point, the movie pauses to bring it to life through Paddington’s eyes. In a bravura sequence of mixed digital effects, Paddington imagines himself and Lucy as miniatures wandering through the book’s pop-up cardboard pages. He waves from within a paper doll crowd as Lucy arrives on a folding boat. The camera swirls, the pages ruffle and the streets of London unfurl to reveal illustrated lamps and paper cars.The introduction of the pop-up book is an early peak for the film, but it is far from the last sequence of arresting originality. The great surprise of “Paddington 2” is that the director, Paul King, creates a whole world of equally adorable objects, any of which might spring to new life with Paddington’s touch. Pipes become telephones, blankets become hot air balloons and people become kinder, happier versions of themselves.In one such act of transformation, a group of prisoners, lifted from gloom by Paddington’s marmalade sandwiches and pink prison uniforms, sing calypso to mark his contributions to the penitentiary: “Life would be easier, time would be breezier, if you loved your neighbor.”Neighborliness is next to godliness in “Paddington 2.” It’s telling that the film’s villain is a performer whose narcissism prohibits collaboration, a man who finds his neighbors a nuisance. For Phoenix Buchanan, the only object worth examining is his own mirror. By contrast, Mr. King and his excellent team of actors and animators spin good writing and seamless digital effects into Rococo children’s entertainment. The gags don’t accumulate; they tessellate. Yet the tone betrays neither effort nor arrogance — pride being a deadly sin for comedy. Instead “Paddington 2” follows the guileless lead of its earnest, ursine little tramp, suggesting tactfully that cinematic ingenuity is another way of showing good manners."

It takes place in southeastern Brazil in 1821 — some six decades before the abolition of slavery — on a squalid farm deep in the mountains. There, a white drover turned farmer, Antonio (Adriano Carvalho), is trying to make a go of it on the backs of enslaved black men, women and children. He’s failed to cultivate the land, blaming it for his defeat, and seems equally terrible at everything else. Soon after the movie opens, his wife and baby die during labor, a tragedy that suggests that here life itself is doomed from the start.Indolent and apparently untroubled by his multiple failings, Antonio had received the farm as part of his wife’s dowry. Her doddering mother, Zizinha (Juliana Carneiro Da Cunha), came with the place, and presumably so did the slaves who mind the house, like Joana (Geisa Costa), and others who tend the farm, like Porfírio (Adilson Maghá). It’s an austere, pitiless world and might be a near-unbearable, unwatchable one if the director Daniela Thomas didn’t hook you early. But she does, starting with the black-and-white cinematography that draws you in, just because it’s so infrequently used these days.The palette is alluringly exotic, but it’s also expressive, with subtle shades — white, dove, slate, jet — that soon take on metaphoric resonance. (Inti Briones is the director of photography.) Yet while the visuals and natural world catch the eye, Ms. Thomas, who has directed movies with Walter Salles, rarely lingers to admire the view or her own handiwork. There’s a bracing lack of vanity in how she conveys this long-lost world and not an iota of misplaced nostalgia. She shows you the loveliness, but she also insistently juxtaposes it with the grim sights and clanging sounds of heavily shackled men.ImageMs. Nastas and Vinicius Dos Anjos.CreditInti Briones/Music Box FilmsMs. Thomas, working from a script by her and Beto Amaral, plots the narrative coordinates fairly leisurely. The movie’s rhythms are unhurried, though for the most part not indulgently so, and fit both the period and Antonio’s uneasy lassitude (which makes a stark contrast with the slaves’ work). Characters enter and exit, offering up names and filling in the back story. Antonio’s brother-in-law, Bartholomeu (Roberto Audio), slides into the picture with his unhappy wife, Ondina (Sandra Corveloni), and their daughters, Maria Joaquina (Isadora Favero) and Beatriz (Luana Nastas). They’re poor, but while Bartholomeu has resigned himself to his fate, the women around him have not.In time, Ms. Thomas’s focus narrows on Beatriz, whom Antonio weds. He soon departs on business, leaving his child bride (she hasn’t started menstruating) and addled mother-in-law with his openly restless slaves, a development that makes next to no narrative sense but gives Ms. Thomas ample time to stir up trouble and add some dramatic tension. With Antonio away, Beatriz is soon running through the fields with a young slave, Virgílio (Vinicius Dos Anjos). His mother, Feliciana (Jai Baptista), is routinely forced to share Antonio’s bed, which suggests that Virgílio may be Antonio’s son, one more complication in a lyrically minded movie that wafts into schematic tidiness and bluntness.This shift is at odds with Ms. Thomas’s embrace of ellipticism. She’s obviously interested in how race influences gender and class, and how they all press against — and impinge on — one another until they’re inseparable. (The lack of indigenous people in this story is a curious absence.) It’s also evident that she doesn’t want to make a thesis movie or put speeches in anyone’s mouth. So for much of the movie she comes at her ideas sideways, circling them much as her characters orbit one another and letting her images — a black boy gently running his fingers over a white girl’s arm — carry the weight of her meaning.By the end, it’s hard not to wish that Ms. Thomas had traded a bit of her art-film drift for something more direct. One of her strongest characters turns out to be an unnamed slave (Toumani Kouyaté, excellent), who’s part of a new group that Antonio brings to the farm. A ferociously charismatic presence, this man serves as the group’s leader and insistently speaks up, commanding attention with each utterance. In a misguided decision, though, his dialogue hasn’t been subtitled, ostensibly because no one at the farm understands the newcomers. “It ain’t Bantu,” an older slave says, referring to an African language. The one man here worth listening to has been effectively silenced."

You could also put it the other way around. The film, directed by Ziad Doueiri (“West Beirut,” “The Attack”), reveals how large-scale social divisions infect even the most banal daily interactions.Two guys have an argument about a pipe that drips water from an apartment terrace onto the street below. Harsh words are exchanged. An apology is demanded. A punch is thrown. And then, as the matter winds its way through two different courts, memories of past atrocities are dredged up, and Lebanon’s civil war, which officially ended in 1990, seems on the verge of erupting all over again.For a viewer with only cursory knowledge of that conflict, which began in the mid-70s and transformed Beirut from a symbol of Mediterranean elegance into a synonym for Middle Eastern chaos, “The Insult” is a fascinating history lesson. It is also a reminder that resentment and hatred don’t necessarily recede when the fighting stops. People have long memories, and so do groups whose identities rest in part on seeing one another as enemies.In that sense, Tony Hanna (Adel Karam), a garage owner, and Yasser Salameh (Kamel El Basha), the foreman of a construction crew, hate each other before they ever meet. Tony is a follower of Lebanon’s Christian party, which is less a matter of religious devotion than of ideological zeal. He faithfully attends political rallies and watches videos of speeches by Bachir Gemayel, the Christian militia leader who was briefly the president-elect before being assassinated in 1982.ImageMr. Karam with Rita Hayek, who portrays his pregnant wife in the film.CreditCohen Media GroupYasser, who is about 15 years older than Tony, is Palestinian. Though he has lived in Beirut for decades, his legal status is ambiguous, and the neighborhood where he lives with his Lebanese wife, Manal (Christine Choueiri), is classified as a refugee camp. In spite of their mutual hostility, he and Tony have a lot in common. They are both hard workers and good husbands, and each is a victim of his own stubbornness as well as of the other’s provocations. Tony is more of a hothead, while Yasser is more likely to seethe in silence, but they share an inclination to value dignity more than common sense and to see humiliation as a kind of existential death.Manal tries to reason with her husband, as does Tony’s wife, Shirine (Rita Hayek), who is pregnant with their first child. Neither man really intends for things to escalate the way they do, nor can either figure out how to back down without a loss of face that would also feel like a betrayal. And so the movie’s focus shifts from the private world of work and family into the court system and the news media. Tony hires a prominent Christian lawyer (the wonderfully histrionic Camille Salameh), while Yasser is represented by a woman (Diamand Bou Abboud) who turns out to be — spoiler alert! Metaphor alert! — the opposing counsel’s daughter.As that plot twist suggests, “The Insult,” is not always subtle. As the trial progresses, it becomes more programmatic, confronting the viewer and the characters with reminders of past atrocities that sometimes feel heavy-handed. But the film derives some of its vital energy from the way that it often seems to argue with itself. The grace and precision of the performances — not only Mr. Karam’s and Mr. El Basha’s, but also those of the actors playing the colleagues, advocates, surprise witnesses and bureaucrats who populate an increasingly crowded story — push against the director’s fondness for grand statements and obvious ironies.This internal tension brings home the complicated point Mr. Doueiri is determined to make, which is that personal matters are neither separate from political concerns nor identical with them. At several moments, you expect a sentimental, uplifting solution, the hug or handshake that assures everyone that bygones will be bygones, that deep down we’re all the same. But that would be a lie. The more complicated truth is that everyone who holds a grudge does so for a reason, and fears that letting go of it would mean the loss of something precious.That may not seem like a very hopeful or happy idea. A hopeful, happy movie about the Middle East may be too much to ask for right now. But “The Insult” is too energetic to be depressing. Sometimes it’s just too energetic, period. But there is something undeniably exhilarating about the film’s honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation, neighborhood and heart."

In other words, whether by serendipity or prophetic insight or some combination of the two, it’s a perfect movie for the moment.Laila (Mouna Hawa), a lawyer, and Salma (Sana Jammelieh), a D.J. who supports herself with restaurant work, spend their free time doing what their counterparts in Berlin, New York and other big cosmopolitan cities do — going to clubs, getting high, drinking and canoodling in a large and shifting crowd of friends. When their roommate leaves the nest to marry, she arranges for her cousin Nur (Shaden Kanboura) to take her place. Nur, who is studying computer science, is an observant Muslim who tries, as politely as she can, to disguise her disapproval of Laila and Salma’s hedonistic lifestyle. Nur’s fiancé, Wissam (Henry Andrawes), is more blunt, worrying about the state of her soul and trying to arrange for her to move somewhere else.For a while, Ms. Hamoud plays the small-scale culture-war skirmishes between Nur and the others for comedy, partly because humor is Laila and Salma’s readiest defense when moments of conflict or discomfort arise. But slowly the picture darkens, and you begin to understand that the independence these women enjoy comes at a serious price, that their free-spiritedness results from a principled, implicitly political commitment to their own autonomy.The plots and subplots of this busy film coalesce around the single, multifarious problem of patriarchal authority, which each of the three main characters confronts in a different guise. Wissam, who at first seems like a humorless but basically well-meaning guy, turns out to be something much worse. But “In Between” doesn’t suppose that only pious, Muslim men mistreat the women in their lives. Salma, who is gay, faces the brutal intolerance of her Christian family, while Laila finds that her dreamy, artistic, well-traveled boyfriend, Ziad (Mahmoud Shalaby), is not as open-minded as he seemed.In retrospect, the three-stranded story “In Between” braids together might look a bit tidy and schematic, but it makes its points with an impressive mixture of clarity and nuance. The central performances are all terrific. Ms. Hawa, tall and glamorous, with regal bearing and a cloud of curls, has an effortlessly commanding presence, and for a while Ms. Jammelieh and Ms. Kanboura dwell in the shadow of her charisma. But each asserts herself in a different way: Ms. Jammelieh by finding the well of emotion behind Salma’s cool, cynical facade and Ms. Kanboura by locating both Nur’s toughness and her half-hidden sense of fun.“In Between,” Ms. Hamoud’s debut feature, is an unusually welcoming and engaging film, inviting you to become a part of the circle of friends it depicts with such energy and warmth. For that reason, it can also be frustrating. So much is packed into two hours — so many big and small emotions, events and issues, so many potentially interesting people — that you may find yourself wanting both more and less.It’s hard not to wish that instead of a single feature film, Ms. Hamoud had made a television season about Laila, Salma and Nur, so that the audience’s curiosity about them could have been fully satisfied and just so we could hang out with them more regularly. We barely meet Nur’s father, Salma’s girlfriend or the Jewish colleague Laila flirts with on smoke breaks. All of them seem worth knowing better. The glimpses of Tel Aviv at work and play (and of Nazareth, Salma’s hometown) are tantalizing. The party is over too soon!Which is not really a serious criticism, and is part of the point “In Between” is making. The movie ends right at the moment when it seems as if a potentially bigger story — about what happens after the awakening and reckoning, after the mutual recognition of #MeToo — could finally begin."

Here, he works with his regular collaborators Evan Johnson and Galen Johnson. Commissioned by the San Francisco Film Society — now called SFFILM, which runs the city’s main film festival — and Stanford Live, the movie had its premiere in April with accompaniment by the Kronos Quartet, which later recorded the score.First and foremost, “The Green Fog” is a marvel of film scholarship that looks backward and forward from the Hitchcock masterpiece. Pre-“Vertigo” noirs like “Dark Passage” (1947) and “Sudden Fear” (1952) share the screen with films that consciously or unconsciously emulate “Vertigo,” not the least of which is Mel Brooks’s 1977 parody “High Anxiety.” (It’s unclear what it says about San Francisco that it has so consistently served as a backdrop for the work of Joe Eszterhas, the screenwriter of “Jagged Edge,” “Basic Instinct” and “Jade.”)Moviegoers even casually familiar with “Vertigo” should be able to follow the story, which is evoked with varying degrees of literalism and editing fluidity. To conjure a sense of Scottie (James Stewart) watching Madeleine (Kim Novak) at the Legion of Honor, the filmmakers cut to another clip shot at the museum. When “The Green Fog” reaches the moment that Scottie recognizes Madeleine’s necklace, the horror of that realization is captured in Donald Sutherland’s scream from the finale of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1978).Few directors were more adept at constructing wordless sequences than Hitchcock, and “The Green Fog,” perhaps for coherence’s sake, frequently cuts out dialogue, sometimes for comic purposes; the effect is a bit like watching a DVD that keeps skipping slightly ahead. Typically for Mr. Maddin, there are also a few meta flourishes. In the weirdest, characters in the 1970s police series “McMillan & Wife” watch a TV that, thanks to some visual trickery, appears to be showing ’N Sync’s video for “This I Promise You.” (The music video is meant to suggest Scottie and Madeleine’s walk through the redwoods, shot in a similar location.)As a chronicle of how San Francisco has changed over the years — and as a salute to the city’s role as a back lot for masters like Erich von Stroheim and Howard Hawks — “The Green Fog” is a wonder of excavation and urban history. What it says about Hitchcock is more ambiguous.There is a slight arrogance in presuming that one of the greatest of films all time (“Vertigo” topped the 2012 Sight and Sound magazine poll) could be approximated, even a little, using clips from lesser directors. Then again, if trying to recreate a lost object of obsession from the materials at hand was Hitchcock’s subject, then he couldn’t ask for a more fitting tribute."

The first time this Belgian-born Romany musician performs onscreen, the camera shows the actor, Reda Kateb, from the back — creating a moment of suspense about whether he will be able to mimic Reinhardt’s kinetic strumming. He does, though music is hardly the film’s focus.Directed by E´tienne Comar (a screenwriter and producer on the acclaimed “Of Gods and Men”), “Django” confines itself to a narrow period during World War II, when Reinhardt enjoyed incongruous success. As the biographer Michael Dregni writes, Reinhardt, as a Gypsy, offended Nazi ideas about racial purity, and Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda minister, condemned jazz as a genre. Yet Germans in occupied Paris loved to hear Reinhardt play. In the film we see Nazis bark orders about the maximum length of solos and the appropriate percentage of syncopation. Reinhardt slyly flouts the rules.Much of “Django” deals with Reinhardt’s life in Thonon, France, on Lake Geneva, from where he hoped to escape to Switzerland with his family. At an encampment in France, he plays music alongside fellow Romany people who regard him as a hero.In life, Mr. Reinhardt didn’t escape successfully. But perhaps wishing to avoid the grim fatalism of “The Pianist,” Mr. Comar contrives a mistress with a heart of gold (Cécile de France) and a plan for Reinhardt to distract the swing-dancing Germans in the area with a concert. The finale enlivens an otherwise staid biopic, but whether the film has earned a moment of uplift is unclear."

Fellow students jeer and call her “psycho” and “Sybil.” (The name refers to the 1970s best seller and its television adaptations, about a woman with multiple personalities.) But soon she’s taken under the wing of a new teacher, Jeremy, a former actor, who assigns Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” for a project. And he casts Abigail in the role of — you’ll never guess — Abigail. This arouses the ire of many, particularly Melissa, a punky “popular” girl who’s used to getting her way.Quinn Shephard, who wrote and directed the film, portrays Abigail. The use of the Miller play seems intended to draw a dramatic parallel with the high school hysteria. But instead, “Blame” often resembles “Carrie,” minus the pig’s blood and telekinesis, and with drama class added.Now in her early 20s, Ms. Shephard is not far removed from high school herself. But her movie, for all its frankness (not terribly distinctive from that of many, many other indie movies about troubled teenagers) does not resonate like direct experience. “Blame” is earnest but underdeveloped. At the same time, it’s overdetermined and often overplayed. As Melissa, for instance, Nadia Alexander telegraphs her hostility toward pretty much everything with a relentlessness that suggests that she studied acting under Godzilla.Ms. Shephard seems to proceed from the fallacy that a steady stream of humorless unpleasantness automatically equals powerful drama, and lays on the portent accordingly. So, of course, when Abigail is stood up by a popular boy who had suggested a rehearsal date, it’s on the afternoon of a torrential downpour. By the time the movie gets around to depicting its evil cheerleaders in slow motion, its emotional credibility is down the drain."

But how?”A version of that quote, attributed to the playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt, opens “In the Land of Pomegranates,” and its question hangs over each scene. Everyone interviewed in this sobering documentary — Israeli or Palestinian — agrees that something must be done to stop the bloodshed in their land. But even talking about solutions proves problematic.The film centers on “Vacation From War,” a retreat in Germany that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians. They live and travel together for a few weeks, often gathering for discussion and debate in the hope of fostering tolerance.Intercut with excerpts from their meetings is bloody footage of violent encounters in Israel and the occupied territories and conversations with a handful of residents, including a bus passenger who was severely injured in a suicide bombing attack and a Palestinian mother whose ailing child is being treated by an Israeli physician.Like several recent films on Israel, including “Wrestling Jerusalem” and “Rabin in His Own Words,” “In the Land of Pomegranates” holds no illusions about a quick end to the conflicts there. Hava Kohav Beller, the director, avoids false optimism and feel-good moments. Though the young people she interviews at least attempt to speak with one other, their rage runs deep, and few find common ground with those who hold opposing views.“Our goal is not to make people love each other,” says Mohammad, an organizer of the retreat. “If only five of the 60 participants from each side experience a change, I would be happy.” For him and for Ms. Beller, hope is tempered and expectations are restrained. They and the others deliver a tough and cleareyed look at how things are, rather than how we want them to be."

The directorial debut of Clay Staub, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Aperlo, opens with a hot rod speeding down a chalky-looking road in the middle of nowhere, then sputtering to a halt. Out of the car hops an irritated hipster dirtbag, cussing up a storm. The only house nearby looks just like the one in the 1974 version of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and suggests that its owners have received some sort of expansion loan. Wandering around the grounds after his cries for help have been ignored, he falls into a couple of booby traps that render his car troubles superfluous.This house is in a North Dakota town called Devil’s Gate, and as the movie’s title implies, the burg’s name could be literal. Enter F.B.I. Special Agent Daria Francis (Amanda Schull, who has a strong kid-sister-of-Abbie-Cornish vibe). She is addressed as “ma’am,” “sweetie” and “hon” in less than five minutes, after she turns down a friendly deputy’s offer of a chicken fried steak because she’s vegan.Culture clash established, the movie settles into shock-and-jolt mode, as Daria and the deputy (Shawn Ashmore) pay a visit to the creepy house’s owner, Jackson Pritchard, played by the popular “This Is Us” star Milo Ventimiglia. His character here is not ingratiating. Jackson is a suspected kidnapper who, it turns out, is sitting on a great big satanic secret. It reveals itself in the gathering of supergray C.G.I. storm clouds, and, finally, a vortex into another realm. Is it extraterrestrial? Supernatural? This is one of those horror movies that want to have it every way possible. It’s not good, but it could pass muster among midnight-movie enthusiasts or curious stoners."

Chases, shootouts and showy camera moves are executed deftly enough, but given the frugal trappings, they play as overambitious — an attempt to make a storage tank of lemonade from one lemon.The story begins when Spencer (James Moses Black), a cop in league with a local gangster, confronts one of the gangster’s sons, Tevi (Dave Davis), outside the warehouse that he’s staking out — minutes before a blood bath inside that leaves only one survivor.Quentin Tarantino-style flashbacks illuminate what happened. Inside the warehouse, Tevi and his father’s henchmen had been avenging the killing of Tevi’s brother. But Tevi, untrusting of the rival gangsters who delivered the ostensible murderer (Billy Slaughter), wasn’t sure they had the right guy. In the present time frame, Tevi, the smart son who could have avoided a life of crime, and the avuncular Spencer team up track down the wounded man who escaped the scene.Mr. Hickman clearly knows New Orleans and has branched out beyond obvious locations, making the city a central presence. The acting, on the other hand, might best be described as uneven, and a hollow finale mutes whatever impact the movie might have had as a character study. “Dark Meridian” proves that Mr. Hickman has the capacity to surprise, but it doesn’t prove much more."

As its title suggests, it is a head-to-battered-toe consideration of a male ballet dancer that takes you from studio to stage and points in between. It is formally conventional and draws on the usual zippy you-are-there moments with lots of gabby talking heads. What elevates it, though, is its charming — and from all accounts — deeply talented subject, Marcelo Gomes. So after it was over I eagerly searched Google for him on my phone only to discover that the day before, on Dec. 21, he had resigned from the American Ballet Theater after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The details remain sketchy. The New York Times reported that Andrew F. Barth, the chairman of the company’s board of trustees, had announced the bombshell news in an emailed statement: “Last Saturday, A.B.T. was made aware of a highly concerning allegation of sexual misconduct by Mr. Gomes, occurring approximately eight years ago.” Ballet Theater took “immediate action,” and during its investigation, Mr. Gomes resigned. His spokeswoman told The Times in another emailed statement: “This is a time of reflection for Marcelo. He is gratified and strengthened by the support he has received from family, friends and colleagues. We have no further comment at this time.”ImageMr. Gomes warming up.CreditRetribution Media/Cinema TropicalThese revelations aren’t in “Anatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer,” which was produced, directed and shot by David Barba and James Pellerito. And while the accusations don’t invalidate the documentary, they have inevitably transformed its generally breezy, sometimes teary and altogether upbeat portrait. The movie is a classic underdog story, that of a Brazilian prodigy who — with a great deal of raw talent and drive, along with the kindness and encouragement of family and friends — matures into a genius of dance. Now, invariably, every painstaking step of that journey, each beat and milestone, comes with an unsettling asterisk as delight at his artistry mixes with doubt about his character.The artistry is unassailable. Mr. Barba and Mr. Pellerito began shooting the movie in early 2010. Mr. Gomes had joined Ballet Theater in 1997 at 18 and was promoted to a principal dancer in 2002. He soared. In a 2007 review of “Cinderella” in The Times, Alastair Macaulay wrote that Mr. Gomes “is at his finest as her prince: handsome dancing, modest, relaxed, attentive” — a description that nicely fits scene after scene of his performances here. Much of the documentary’s drama involves the countdown to his 20th anniversary with Ballet Theater and all that entails, including Mr. Gomes’s acute attention to his aging body and his hope that his father will see him dance in New York.Documentary portraits of this type often incorporate testimonials from affable, encouraging experts who smilingly help burnish the subject’s reputation. “Anatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer” is stuffed with such enthusiastic recommendations, including from numerous dancers — Misty Copeland, Julie Kent and Veronika Part — with whom Mr. Gomes partnered over his career. The love for him just pours off the screen in these moments, as does the respect and admiration. These persuasive testimonials are scattered among the dances, festivals and interstitial sections in which the energetic, very peripatetic Mr. Gomes quiets down and settles in for some intimate on-camera sharing.Much of this is agreeable, or at least was. In retrospect, the sheer amount of gush in the movie, all the praise and feverish shouts of bravo, underscores the limits of affirmational documentaries. It is also a reminder that a movie’s meaning is made (and remade) by its viewers, not just its content. Mr. Barba and Mr. Pellerito set out to create a portrait of Mr. Gomes, who comes across as an extremely nice guy. When I saw the movie in December, their portrayal seemed rather too fluffy and fawningly one-note, but it was also hard to resist. Mr. Gomes can be thrilling to watch even when partly obscured by a partner’s dress, but it may be that more of him was hidden from us than this movie suggests."

Like most omnibus programs, the offerings are a mixed bag, but this year’s 16 titles showcase a gratifying range of styles and subjects, with work that includes veterans and newcomers, the experimental and the commercial.Some of the most innovative titles are among the shortest — and Canadian — like Steven Woloshen’s “Casino.” Scored to the Oscar Peterson Trio’s riff on “Something’s Coming,” from “West Side Story,” it conjures the frenzy of a night on the gambling floor in a four-minute swirl of color, evoking roulette wheels, slot machines and card games with an almost Abstract Expressionist simplicity of line. (While conventional animation involves photographing illustrations, Mr. Woloshen draws directly on strips of film.)The Montreal-based animator Alexanne Desrosiers’s offbeat “Les Abeilles Domestiques (Domestic Bees)” begins with an inset image of the Grim Reaper visiting an elderly couple, then unfolds outward, with multiplying, beehivelike panels, to form a cryptic split-screen mosaic of the life cycle. It’s proof that great animation doesn’t demand a certain medium or budget — this two-minute short was made with commercially available computer software — just a fresh vantage point. Given how busy each panel is, the movie demands viewing on a large, eye-filling screen, similar to the kind used at the 1967 Montreal Expo.One of the revivals, “Hangman,” from 1964, was shown in school classrooms to provoke discussion. Paul Julian (a veteran of the Looney Tunes background team) and Les Goldman (who shared an Oscar with Chuck Jones in 1966 for “The Dot and the Line”) employ creepily angular imagery to illustrate Maurice Ogden’s poem “The Hangman,” a rhyming allegory about a town’s acquiescence to an executioner who keeps demanding victims for his gallows.The other older work in the program is “Next Door,” a 1990 student film from Pete Docter, of Pixar. “Next Door” anticipates the curmudgeon-moppet bonding of Mr. Docter’s great Oscar-winning film “Up” (2009), but it also finds this artist — known for his computer animation — working in a delightful hand-drawn style, with characters whose eyebrows are as expressive as their smiles.On the other hand, the former Disney animator Glen Keane’s draftsmanship, and a score rather recognizably by John Williams, don’t do enough to distinguish “Dear Basketball,” a mawkish ode to hoop dreams created and narrated by Kobe Bryant, from the bland uplift of a Nike commercial. In voice-over, Mr. Bryant serenades his love of the sport from his time as a small boy, watching videos of the Los Angeles Lakers, to his retirement from that team in 2016.The Swedish artist Niki Lindroth von Bahr’s prizewinning “The Burden,” set in a grim, anthropomorphized Nordic city filled with singing fish, simian telemarketers and tap-dancing mice, has been growing on me since it showed at Film Forum this fall. But for an embittered worldview, I prefer “Unsatisfying,” by the French animation company Parallel Studio. The shortest, and by far the funniest, film in this program, it sets a compendium of petty everyday frustrations to Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings."

Yet “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool,” a real-life romance adapted from the 1986 memoir by Peter Turner, reveals an unexpected fontanel of sentiment in Mr. McGuigan’s style that — when not tipping over into bathos — can be rather lovely.Unfolding during the final years in the life of the actress Gloria Grahame (who died in 1981), the movie recounts her unlikely last-gasp love affair with Mr. Turner, an English actor. When they met, in a London boardinghouse in 1978, he was 26 and she was almost three decades older, striving to supplement a waning film career with stage roles. Once a major star (she won an Oscar in 1952 for “The Bad and the Beautiful”), Grahame excelled at playing knowingly sultry floozies. Her characters were often equal parts brass and Jell-O — a combination that unmanned many a male co-star.Peter (Jamie Bell) is no exception, and the movie’s early scenes have a wonderful buoyancy as he and Gloria (Annette Bening) effortlessly connect. Hanging out in movie theaters and blue-collar pubs, the two develop a credible chemistry that renders age irrelevant. This atmosphere of playful sexiness fades all too soon, though, when Gloria becomes desperately ill and asks to be cared for by Peter’s mother, Bella (Julie Walters, at her tart-tongued best), in his childhood home in Liverpool.It’s a depressingly dreary ending to a tumultuous life. And as briefly luminous scenes in Los Angeles and Manhattan give way to Bella’s drab council house (whose screeching wallpaper would have sapped anyone’s will to live), Mr. McGuigan labors to dispel the odor of the grave. Directing with some flair, he employs a zigzagging timeline that gooses Matt Greenhalgh’s otherwise downbeat screenplay. In tandem with the cinematographer Urszula Pontikos, he makes a virtue of contrivance, emphasizing the artifice of some of the movie’s sets by, say, having Peter stride seamlessly off a Los Angeles beach and into a Liverpudlian hallway.Tricks like this are a welcome distraction from the story’s overreliance on pathos, but they’re not the director’s only weapon: He also has a talent for constructing stand-alone scenes that inspire us to picture worlds beyond their margins. In one of these, Gloria meets with her British mother and sulkily jealous sister (Vanessa Redgrave and Frances Barber, both perfect), and the encounter spins a handful of lines of dialogue into imagined decades of deep dysfunction.Sinking too quickly from light and bright to sad and soggy, “Film Stars” affords Ms. Bening (who should have easily nabbed an Oscar last year for her sensational work in Mike Mills’s “20th Century Women”) precious few opportunities to enchant. Still, she’s marvelously mutable, shifting subtly from insecure to prideful and back again as her allure drains and her strength fails.As marvelous as she is, it’s Mr. Bell who might be the film’s greatest surprise. Ever since he leapt onto our screens in 2000 as a gawky kid in “Billy Elliot,” his opportunities to play a romantic lead have been virtually nil. Which is a pity, because he approaches ardor with a restrained sincerity that encourages us to trust the character. In one pivotal fight scene, filmed from both lovers’ perspectives, he makes Peter’s hurt and confusion touchingly real.Landing lightly on the loneliness of fame and the ravages of aging, “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool” is a fond farewell to a distinctive talent. Yet I couldn’t help wishing it had spent less time anticipating Grahame’s death and a little more illuminating her life."

The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law & Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive “Head-On” and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama “The Edge of Heaven,” observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: “Nazis killed my husband.” She has the grim satisfaction of being right.ImageMs. Kruger plays a woman whose husband and son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.CreditMagnolia PicturesIf the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous.But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie’s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as “In the Fade” should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja’s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin’s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing, but moving on might be even worse."

Paul Getty would probably have disagreed with Shakespeare’s take. A hoarder of women, art, antiquities — and most of all, money — Getty also might have taken issue with Portia’s claim that mercy “becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.” Portia delivers her mercy speech as she tries to persuade Shylock not to take a pound of flesh. She would have had an even tougher time with Getty.“All the Money in the World” is a story of towering greed and the absence of mercy, and an ideal 21st century morality tale. It’s about money and families and the ties that bind and cut, although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn’t a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty’s 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul’s mother, “Get it from London.” It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, “If I pay one penny now, I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,” a kiss-off heard around the world.Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome’s crowded streets. It’s night, and pretty, boyish Paul (Charlie Plummer) is savoring la dolce vita, floating past the city’s flesh and marble beauties and its swarms of catcalling, hustling paparazzi. There’s sensuousness to Paul’s drift, which, as the camera silkily slips alongside him, suggests a casual luxurious attitude toward life, of being free to do anything, go anywhere, say anything. He’s kissed by fortune but also by youth. And when a streetwalker calls him baby and he smiles, you see just how young. Within seconds he’s been kidnapped.“All the Money in the World” revs up beautifully, first as a thriller. But while the kidnapping is the movie’s main event, it is only part of a story that is, by turns, a sordid, desperate and anguished tragedy about money. When Paul is kidnapped, Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer) has already amassed a fortune, one partly pumped out of oil fields both in the United States and in the Middle East. (The Plummers are not related.) He lives alone in crepuscular gloom in Sutton Place, a manor house built by a favorite courtier of Henry VIII. There, amid miles of rooms adorned with gilt-framed masterworks, Getty Sr. closely monitors the stock information on the disgorging ticker tape that’s both his leash and lifeline.Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn’t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn’t matter.Like many contemporary movies, this one kinks up its timeline. After Paul is kidnapped, the scene shifts to Saudi Arabia in 1948, where Getty Sr. is laying the foundation for an even greater fortune. Written by David Scarpa — working from John Pearson’s 1995 book “Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty” — the movie continues to jump around, filling in the back story while deepening the atmosphere and gathering the dramatis personae. One intimate scene takes place in the 1960s, where Paul’s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams, warmth incarnate), and father, Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are going broke with four boisterous young children.By the time Paul is kidnapped, his nuclear family has imploded; Getty Jr. is lost in an opium cloud and Gail is living in Rome. Much of the movie involves the drama of the kidnapping, which unfolds in separate, increasingly tightly woven-together lines of action. Taken by a ragtag criminal gang, Paul is stashed in a desolate farmhouse, where his closest keeper becomes Cinquanta (Romain Duris, a charismatically feral presence). In Rome, Gail struggles with the kidnappers, police and paparazzi while trying to interest Getty Sr. in his grandson. Getty Sr. continues counting out his money, only reluctantly calling in the cavalry, a security specialist, Fletcher (a very fine Mark Wahlberg).Mr. Scott conjures up entire worlds and sensibilities with visual precision, adding detail even when going for sweep. Each new scene adds another layer of meaning, thickening the slow-building sense of dread: the men in billowing white robes on oil-rich land waiting for Getty Sr., a master of the universe who arrives in a demonically belching train. Gail and Getty Jr., anxiously presenting their young family to Getty Sr. like paupers bowing down before the lord of the realm. As the story shifts from farmhouse to manor, from the kidnappers to Getty Sr. (each side armed, impatient, brutal), a parallelism develops and it becomes clear that he took his family hostage long before the kidnapping.ImageMichelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg in the film.CreditClaudio Iannone/Sony-TriStar PicturesMr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya’s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he’s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It’s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation.At one point in the movie, Getty Sr. does pull out his wallet, buying a masterpiece while Paul continues to languish with his kidnappers, an ordeal that grows more frightening and byzantine as the clock winds down. Gail and Fletcher are struggling to free Paul, an effort that finds them often grappling with Getty Sr. His interest in Paul rises and falls, much like the stock market does. He has become famous for his status as the wealthiest man in the world, prominence that he clings to, much like his money. He has filled his manor house with priceless objects, turning statues and paintings into fetishes. He has earned so much, spent so much and, in doing so, insured that he and everyone else have lost."
"5899","Phantom Thread","R",1,"A.O. SCOTT","Review: Daniel Day-Lewis Sews Up Another Great Performance in ‘Phantom Thread’","Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film is a luxuriant love story set in 1950s London.","2017-12-24","2017-12-25","2018-01-24 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/movies/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis.html,Read the New York Times Review of Phantom Thread,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/25/arts/25phantomthread-1/25phantomthread-1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (“Never cursed” is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand — hidden meanings in the literal sense — signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator.It hardly seems an accident that Paul Thomas Anderson has inscribed his monogram in the title of his eighth feature, “Phantom Thread,” which chronicles a few chapters in Reynolds’s fictional life and career. This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film. I don’t mean autobiographical. I know little and care less about the details of Mr. Anderson’s personal life. Whether or not his longtime partner, the actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, has ever cooked him a mushroom omelet is a matter of complete indifference to me.Not every movie about an artist is a self-portrait of its director, but “Phantom Thread” almost offhandedly lays out intriguing analogies between Reynolds’s métier and Mr. Anderson’s. The fashion designer, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, turns drawings into drama, manipulating color and movement and the human form to construct a material object that is also artificial, idealized and fantastical — a commodity that impersonates a dream. He is assisted in his labor by a crew of disciplined artisans who cut and stitch his ideas into usable form. (This may be the place to note that the editor of “Phantom Thread” is Dylan Tichenor. Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.)The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It’s just a movie. It’s just a dress. When Reynolds’s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more “chic,” the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions.ImageLesley Manville as Cyril, the sister and business partner of the dressmaker played by Mr. Day-Lewis.CreditLaurie Sparham/Focus FeaturesThat discrepancy — between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism — may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since “There Will Be Blood,” Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they’re about or who they might be for.“Phantom Thread” is not as hermetic as “The Master” or as loosey-goosey as “Inherent Vice.” It’s a chamber piece, romantic and baroque in equal measure, with arresting harmonies and ravishing changes of tone. (This might be the place to note that Jonny Greenwood composed the score). Like “There Will Be Blood,” it casts Mr. Day-Lewis as an avatar of obsession, driven this time by the pursuit of aesthetic perfection rather than money and power. But whereas Daniel Plainview in the earlier film was a vector of pure, demonic ambition, Reynolds Woodcock bemusedly discovers himself to be one leg of a complicated emotional triangle.The other sides are Cyril and Alma (Vicky Krieps), a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds’s model, mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma’s predecessor, Johanna (Camilla Rutherford), who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril, with one of Reynolds’s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna’s sin is to request some of her lover’s attention, a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting.That dynamic will repeat itself with Alma, who butters her toast too noisily, pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues — a two-front war for Alma, who must contend with both Woodcock siblings — is the film’s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic, melancholy, inspired, impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps, an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is, this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny, wrenching, full of large and small surprises.ImageMr. Day-Lewis as Reynolds and Ms. Krieps as Alma.CreditLaurie Sparham/Focus FeaturesThe difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true.Like a garment that can be worn with the lining on the outside, “Phantom Thread” reverses itself, almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds’s point of view to Alma’s and back again. She succumbs, at first, to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast, invites her to dinner, takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws — small breasts, broad shoulders, wide hips — he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her.But then, when the spell seems about to wear off, Alma refuses to let it. She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her, which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. “I live here,” she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household, trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this, and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets, and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage.Is Alma a feminist heroine? Some version of that question is likely to fuel more than a few post-screening arguments. Your answer may depend on what you think of the mushroom omelet that is the movie’s spoiler-proof surprise. There are other things to talk about. On first viewing, the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention, but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors, the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together.What kind of love story is “Phantom Thread”? The wrenching tale of a woman’s love for a man and a man’s love for his work. A dry, comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That’s a partial catalog, and one that can’t quite capture how bizarre this movie is. Or how bizarrely true to life — to art, to love, to itself — it feels."

Life comes at you fast, and so do the words that rush out of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) as she relays her tale. A poker entrepreneur who ran a high-stakes game before slamming into trouble, Molly is a speed-talker and somewhat of a close one, too. She delivers stretches of her story in a voice-over that suggests that Mr. Sorkin wrote and directed his movie with a stopwatch in one hand and a DVD of Howard Hawks’s motor-mouth comedy “His Girl Friday” in the other.“His Girl Friday” (1940) has been clocked at 240 words per minute, which sounds about right for the tempo Mr. Sorkin has embraced in “Molly’s Game.” Its titular poker princess is based on the real Molly Bloom, who had a moment a while back when she was busted for running a high-stakes game, her world imploding when the F.B.I. came knocking. She wrote a book, naming players in games she helped run and others she ran — Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and Tobey Maguire — which earned her acreage in Vanity Fair magazine. Her book’s full title is: “Molly’s Game: From Hollywood’s Elite to Wall Street’s Billionaire Boys Club, My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker.”Aaron Sorkin Annotates Aaron SorkinAaron Sorkin annotates the script he wrote for his directorial debut, “Molly’s Game,” starring Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba.Dec. 20, 2017The movie more or less follows the trajectory laid out by that mouthful of a title, though Mr. Sorkin modestly amends it for dramatic purposes. It begins with an early devastating, life-altering ski-crash that occurs when Molly is an Olympic hopeful. Her slope dreams having come to an end, she postpones law school and moves to Los Angeles. (“I wanted to be young for a while in warm weather.”) There, she flops in a friend’s apartment and ends up working at a club, hustling overpriced vodka to guys who think they’re players. She catches the eye of one, Dean (Jeremy Strong), who hires her to help run a high-end poker game where the first buy-in is $10,000.The movie takes off once the cards start shuffling. Molly watches and learns, absorbing the game’s rituals and language while charming the all-male players. She’s a quick study and a committed Googler, looking up poker terminology and music for gambling away money (Kenny Rogers). With his editors, Mr. Sorkin gives Molly’s poker education snap, cutting from shot to shot — from a drink being poured to a slammed-down stack of chips — and turning images into near-hieroglyphics. One of the editors, Alan Baumgarten, worked on David O. Russell’s “American Hustle,” a movie that, like “Molly’s Game,” owes a large debt to Martin Scorsese’s native-son crime stories, including “Casino.”The stakes are rather less vital in “Molly’s Game,” which mostly tracks how a shrewd young woman threw fancy gambling parties for very important and self-important men with exceedingly deep pockets. Once Molly has stopped Googling, her entrepreneurial juices start flowing and she realizes that she could be running her own lucrative game. She does, setting one up at a fancy hotel and trading her nice-girl blah for showier makeup, designer threads and deeper décolletage. The players follow her, including a major star known only as Player X, who Michael Cera — in a wonderful, insinuatingly creepy performance — turns into a portrait of Hollywood entitlement and moral rot.ImageMichael Cera, second left, and Jeremy Strong in “Molly’s Game.” As Player X, Mr. Cera delivers a portrait of Hollywood entitlement and moral rot.CreditMichael Gibson/STX FilmsIt’s too bad there isn’t more of him in “Molly’s Game,” because, despite Ms. Chastain’s charisma and gift for delivering Mr. Sorkin’s fast talk, Molly isn’t interesting. Things happen to her, but most of the action and fun is at the table. Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly, tapping actors like Mr. Strong, Chris O’Dowd and a terrific Bill Camp, the protagonist in an affecting mini-tragedy in three acts (stoicism, disintegration and heartbreak). All the while, Molly smiles on the side, suffers a setback, moves to New York and racks up big money from card games that, at their best, turn into condensed pocket-size dramas, by turns triumphant and catastrophic.Mr. Sorkin tries to deepen Molly’s story and the stakes in several ways, partly through her legal troubles. Soon after the movie opens, the F.B.I. busts her, which leads her to Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), an expensive lawyer who becomes her passionate champion. This gives Mr. Sorkin a second line of action (and an office for discussions), allowing him to switch between Molly’s high-flying past (shuffle, deal, play) and her present-day troubles. As the story unfolds, the past catches up to the present and Mr. Sorkin keeps trying to invest Molly’s story with meaning, mostly through a little family psychodrama and some deeply unpersuasive feminism, including by casting her as a victim of men.It’s hard not to guffaw when, after Molly loses one game, she speaks of her “powerlessness over the unfair whims of men.” But while it’s silly it’s also patronizing, because by attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim — and by glossing over her culpability — Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency. Just as dubiously, when Molly is at her most vulnerable, he trots out a series of male authority figures, including her estranged father (Kevin Costner), who speak at and for her, who excuse her past, vouch for her character and enthuse about her future. They replace all the slick bros at the poker table and, taken together, make quite a paternal choir.It’s a striking progression for a movie that tries, altogether too feebly, to put a feminist spin on a woman who made bank through an illegal gambling ring. Empowerment is one way to look at this story, though only if you sentimentalize its main character. It is hard not to wonder how this movie might have turned out if Mr. Sorkin had decided his protagonist was as much a weasel as the one he wrote for “The Social Network,” another story of an American striver. It’s hard not to wonder, too, how this story might play if its protagonist wasn’t a woman who, as this movie sees it, needed so much male defending."

Set largely during a few anxious weeks in 1971, it revisits The Washington Post’s decision to publish portions of the Pentagon Papers, an immense classified report that chronicled America’s involvement in Southeast Asia from World War II to 1968. In Mr. Spielberg’s hands, that decision becomes a ticktock thriller about the freedom of the press, the White House’s war on that constitutional right and the middle-aged woman who defended freedom in a fabulous gold caftan.The real story began with Daniel Ellsberg, the Marine turned government researcher turned clandestine peacenik who first gave the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. The Times began running portions on June 13, 1971. After the attorney general, John Mitchell, accused The Times of violating the Espionage Act, a judge ordered it to stop publishing the papers. At a pivotal time in American history, the government was preventing the press from getting the news out, on the grounds that it would do injury to national security. Shortly thereafter, The Post, which had been publishing rewrites of The Times’s articles, began running its own excerpts, becoming part of a Supreme Court showdown over the First Amendment.The Pentagon Papers give “The Post” its heft and pulse; the antagonism between the government and the media gives it a shiver of topicality. Even so, shaping a drama around a newspaper that didn’t break the story seems an odd path to Hollywood triumphalism, though the scrappy Post was itching to be a national player. There’s also the matter of the actual import of the Pentagon Papers. In his memoir, Ben Bradlee, The Post’s longtime editor — winningly played by Tom Hanks with macho suavity and an on-and-off Boston accent — devotes four times as much space to Watergate (a story that his paper did break) as to the Pentagon Papers. Except that “The Post” cares less about the hard-charging Bradlee than it does his boss, Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep), the paper’s late-blooming publisher.ImageMs. Streep as Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post.CreditNiko Tavernise/Twentieth Century FoxThe story opens in 1966 with Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), a government analyst on a data-mining mission in Vietnam, pecking out reports on his portable typewriter amid exploding bombs and flowing blood. The secretary of defense, Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood, wearing a frozen smile and an oil slick of hair), thinks the war is going badly but grossly mischaracterizes American progress to journalists. Disillusioned with the official script, Daniel eventually goes cloak-and-dagger rogue and is on his way to publicizing the Pentagon Papers, a momentous decision that Mr. Spielberg enlivens with spooky shadows and what may be the most nervous-making photocopying in film history.The story soon jumps to Katharine, jolting out of a slumber, a sly preview of larger awakenings to come, both her own and that of the country. She’s about to take her company public, a move that she and a close adviser (Tracy Letts, wry and tart) hope will financially stabilize it. During the week that this business is finalized, though, the company will be temporarily vulnerable to its underwriters. The stock offering, Graham writes in her memoir, was scheduled for June 15. Two days, later, The Post had the Pentagon Papers. What happened next is a matter of record, history being the ultimate spoiler. The pleasure of “The Post” is how it sweeps you up in how it all went down.Mostly, it went down fast, a pace that Mr. Spielberg conveys with accelerated rhythms, flying feet, racing cameras and an enjoyably loose approach to the material. With his virtuosic, veteran crew, Mr. Spielberg paints the scene vividly and with daubs of beauty; most notably, he creates distinct visual realms for the story’s two main overlapping, at times colliding worlds. Katharine reigns over one; at first she’s all but entombed in her darkly lighted, wood-paneled empire. Ben rules the other, overseeing the talking and typing warriors of the glaring, noisily freewheeling newsroom. (The costume designer Ann Roth subtly brightens Katharine, taking her from leaden gray to free-flowing gold.)Just as Daniel will come into consciousness so will Katharine, a twinned metamorphosis that, in turn, speaks to the larger cultural and social changes shaking the country. Time and again, men crowd over and around Katharine, walking in front of her, speaking for her. As the drama heats up, the typewriters furiously clack — and the political becomes increasingly personal, and the personal turns political — Katharine finds both a new purpose and identity. With small tilts of her head, darting looks, nervous flutters and a Brahmin imperiousness that gradually eases and warms, Ms. Streep creates an acutely moving portrait of a woman who in liberating herself helps instigate a revolution.ImageMr. Hanks and Ms. Streep.CreditNiko Tavernise/20th Century FoxLike many movies that turn the past into entertainment, “The Post” gently traces the arc of history, while also bending it for dramatic punch and narrative expediency. The filmmakers fold in atmospheric true-to-life details, like the poster for the western film “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (a favorite of the real Mr. Ellsberg) that Daniel and some longhair pals sweep past on their way to illegally copying the Pentagon Papers. And while it’s no surprise that the movie omits and elides important players and crucial episodes, its honed focus jibes with the view of the former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, who wrote that the “public disclosure of the Pentagon Papers challenged the core of a president’s power: his role in foreign and national security affairs.”That challenge becomes the movie’s cri de coeur, its reason for being. And, as that challenge becomes a crusade, it leads to some lump-in-the-throat grandstanding about the press and its relationship to power. Ben and Katharine each have friends in high government places. These allegiances — to friends, to state authority — are tested by the Pentagon Papers, if rather more tested, perhaps, for the purposes of this fiction. Graham’s husband, Phil, and Bradlee were both close with John F. Kennedy. In her memoirs, Graham writes that her friend McNamara helpfully advised The Times on a legally sensitive letter about the Pentagon Papers, a detail that underscores the depth of these powerful allegiances.The Pentagon Papers — officially titled “Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force” — is an encyclopedia of outrageous decisions and acts, what Mr. Ellsberg once described as “evidence of lying, by four presidents and their administrations over twenty-three years, to conceal plans and actions of mass murder.” Mr. Ellsberg didn’t stop the war, but he did assert our right, and obligation, to challenge absolute power. That may be why the filmmakers — the script is by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer — slip in a bit from a speech that Mario Savio delivered two years before “The Post” opens and which memorably asserts: “There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part!”There’s more than a little corn and wishful thinking in the high-minded moments in “The Post”; movies like either to glorify or demonize journalists, relying on heroes and villains. Yet given the recent assaults on journalism and the truth, this heroizing is also irresistible. And Mr. Spielberg, a shrewd entertainer who can be waylaid by moralism, rarely lets virtue drag this movie down. He lightens the heaviness with humor, physical comedy (fumbling, stumbling) and a perfectly synced cast that includes the funnymen David Cross, Zach Woods and a terrific Bob Odenkirk. As a filmmaker, Mr. Spielberg invariably comes down on the side of optimism; here, that hopefulness feels right. It also feels like a rallying cry."

The Laurents, a most high-bourgeois clan, are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retains some mental sharpness in his 80s, but he’s losing his memory, and he’d like to get out — that is, die — while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve’s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress, whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family’s Calais mansion with Eve’s aunt, Anne (Isabelle Huppert), who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat, a task not helped much by her wayward son, Pierre (Franz Rogowski), or a fatal accident at a building site.“Happy End” has a linear structure, but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions, there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past, and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it’s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect, but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes.It also constitutes a bit of misdirection, in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents, as what some would call wealth creators, have, in Mr. Haneke’s view, some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren’t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants, members of the working class — both the documented and undocumented — are not often seen in this movie, but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie, as when Georges, in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails, rolls down a street, festooned with tacky little shops, and stops in front of a group of men, most likely African immigrants. We can’t hear what he’s asking of them, but we can guess. The character’s presumption is staggering on several levels.Like many of Mr. Haneke’s films from the past two decades, “Happy End” is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne’s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in “My Night at Maud’s,” released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in “A Man and a Woman,” 1966) or a fascist dupe (in “The Conformist,” 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie’s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit."

Russell. “Father Figures” doesn’t merely flirt. It stars Ed Helms as Peter and Owen Wilson as Kyle, two of the least-related-seeming twins in history. On the day their mother (Glenn Close) marries some cool cat played by Harry Shearer, they learn that their father isn’t dead, as they thought, but just unknown. Mom didn’t practice monogamy in the disco era.And so the brothers venture out to meet their father. The contenders include Terry Bradshaw (playing himself), who seems thrilled to have Peter to toss around a football with but pays no attention to Kyle, and Roland (J.K. Simmons), who would just as soon betray or shoot his sons as bond with them. Kyle and Peter also pick up a hitchhiker (Katt Williams) who becomes a mediator for their bickering.Distinguished mainly by its overqualified cast and lack of inspiration, “Father Figures” can’t decide whether it’s a gross-out comedy or an uplifting tale of brotherly love; it embraces the worst of both worlds. When not lobbing jokes about prostates, possible incest and mammoth cat testicles, the movie stops cold for Mr. Helms and Mr. Wilson (who can act, on the basis of other movies) to muddle through one heart-to-heart after another. “Father Figures” purports to run about two hours, but it feels like the length of Kyle and Peter’s upbringing."

(If you’re unfamiliar with orcs, check your J. R. R. Tolkien.) The result is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well.Written by Max Landis (whose scripts for “Mr. Right” and the BBC series “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency” have also crossbred genres), “Bright” wastes little time with nettlesome back story about how mythological beings entered our present. Mostly, we simply see that the pointy-eared elves and the swarthy orcs have their own districts in Los Angeles, and two partner patrolmen — the human Daryl Ward (Mr. Smith) and an Orc, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton, deftly evincing character from under mottled makeup) — maintain the peace. Daryl resents Nick for having fumbled an arrest that left Daryl sidelined for weeks, and, like many of his colleagues, he also distrusts Nick, the first orc hired by the department. (The racism metaphor is entirely intentional. There’s even a slur: pigface.)In fact, a small cadre of corrupt officers wants Nick eliminated. And a new threat arrives: Leilah (a hammy yet almost silent Noomi Rapace), a lethal elf serving a malevolent entity called, yes, the Dark Lord. Leilah is after Tikka (Lucy Fry), an elf who has taken possession of a glowing magic wand emitting great destructive energy. When Daryl and Nick (who speaks Elvish) take Tikka under their protection, the three are pursued not only by cops but also by Leilah and her ruthless cronies; a Latino street gang after the wand, led by the nasty Poison (Enrique Murciano); and operatives of a federal Magic Task Force (Edgar Ramirez and Happy Anderson). (For the record, Brights are supernatural beings, often elves, capable of handling a wand’s power.)Mr. Ayer — who wrote “Training Day” and directed the tough policier “End of Watch” and the World War II drama “Fury” — specializes in men enduring pressure-cooker lives of adversity. He strayed into empty superhero theatrics with the slapdash “Suicide Squad” (co-starring Mr. Smith) and again dilutes his integrity with Mr. Smith’s lightweight sitcom likability. You’ll find beatings, shootouts, car crashes, awkward analogies and a measure of buddy badinage in “Bright,” but true enchantment is in short supply."
"5959","Downsizing","R",0,"A.O. SCOTT","Review: In ‘Downsizing,’ Matt Damon Sweats the Small Stuff","Alexander Payne looks at the big picture in his new movie.","2017-12-21","2017-12-22","2018-01-21 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/downsizing-review-matt-damon-kristen-wiig.html,Read the New York Times Review of Downsizing,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/22/arts/22DOWNSIZING/22DOWNSIZING-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"One of my favorite movies of 2017, “War for the Planet of the Apes,” posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine.Alexander Payne’s new movie, “Downsizing,” doesn’t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe, it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as, if not exactly a remedy, then at least an acceptable palliative. We don’t need to disappear altogether, but it might be better all around if we weren’t so darn big.Mr. Payne’s title refers not to corporate cost-saving strategies but to a technological procedure invented by scientists in Norway and adapted for universal, commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth’s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot, crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally.But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn’t that you consume less; it’s that you can have a whole lot more. That’s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong?VideoAlexander Payne narrates a sequence from his film featuring Matt Damon and Hong Chau.Published OnDec. 21, 2017CreditCreditParamount PicturesMr. Payne, who wrote “Downsizing” with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract — in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of “the small” — who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite — is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven’t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers.Mr. Damon’s regular-guy affability carries the movie through its expository phase, which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches, like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds, as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies.Paul, big and small, is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly, but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero’s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul’s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire, the two genres that “Downsizing” nods toward without fully embracing.Instead, the movie resembles an episode of “The Twilight Zone” directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish, pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don’t see this at first, because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels, he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality, treating it the way he treated Hawaii in “The Descendants,” wine country in “Sideways” and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies — as a picturesque, lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness.About an hour in, “Downsizing” amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we’ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul’s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau’s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity.And then, with a bit of a thud, this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations, wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul’s journey loses direction and momentum, and sour, nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven’t we seen this story before, in which a white man’s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?Well, yes, as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale, and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. “Downsizing” is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty, and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal, but maybe that’s my problem."
"5960","Hostiles","R",0,"A.O. SCOTT","Review: ‘Hostiles’ Grapples With the Contradictions of the Western","An Army captain escorts an old enemy and a young widow from New Mexico to Montana in Scott Cooper’s violent modern horse opera.","2017-12-21","2018-01-19","2018-01-21 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/movies/hostiles-review-christian-bale.html,Read the New York Times Review of Hostiles,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/22/arts/22HOSTILES1/22HOSTILES1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"“Hostiles” opens with a well-traveled observation from D.H. Lawrence about how the “essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” It ends with a shot that complicates that idea by revisiting and in effect reversing a famous image from an earlier western: The last moment of “The Searchers,” when John Wayne lingers outside the door, symbolically barred from entering the civilized society he has saved.In between the explicitly cited Lawrence and the implicitly footnoted Wayne, the action winds from New Mexico to Montana and the modern movie audience is led on a tour of a familiar mythic landscape. Our guide, Scott Cooper, who adapted an unpublished manuscript by the screenwriter Donald E. Stewart into this handsome oater, has updated the talking points to take account of changed sensibilities. The result may not quite be a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless a credible master’s thesis, a careful and well-informed exploration of the paradoxes that are as integral to the western genre as horses, whiskey and guns. There are plenty of those things, of course, but there is also a conscientious attempt to reckon with the legacy of plunder and racism that flickers behind the legends.Richard Slotkin, at the conclusion of his magisterial three-volume study of the West in the American imagination, notes that the western, appearances to the contrary, doesn’t have a fixed ideological meaning. We can use the mythology of the frontier, he writes, “to reify our nostalgia for a falsely idealized past,” or we can use it as a way of “imagining and speaking truth.” “Hostiles” sets out to do both. It aims for epic grandeur, ethical clarity and also a measure of historical credibility. This puts the movie in a state of contradiction with itself, like nearly every other good western and, for that matter, like the United States of America.It’s 1892, and the Indian Wars are winding down. Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale), a walking embodiment of Lawrence’s archetype, has made a career of genocidal slaughter, which has left him bitter but not remorseful. Blocker is no brute: He reads Julius Caesar in the original Latin. And he hates Indians with a righteous purity that is shocking to contemplate now but was hardly abnormal in those days.To the extent that Blocker has been a soldier doing his job, the movie regards him with sympathy, and supplies an Eastern intellectual (Bill Camp, wearing round spectacles) to sneer and judge. In general, those few white people who speak up in the movie against white brutality are viewed with contempt, even as the agents of that brutality are offered a chance at redemption. The moral economy of “Hostiles” dictates that only those who have made war can participate in the regenerative violence that leads toward peace.Before he can collect his pension, Blocker is given what for him is a supremely distasteful mission. He must escort one of his old enemies, a dying Cheyenne chief named Yellow Hawk, to his ancestral lands up north. Blocker holds Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) personally responsible for the deaths of his friends and regards the government’s decision to set him free after years in captivity to be an intolerable betrayal. But duty is duty, and he gathers up a posse of fine character actors (including Jesse Plemons, Jonathan Majors, Timothée Chalamet and an especially good Rory Cochrane) to accompany the chief and his family (Q’orianka Kilcher, Adam Beach, Xavier Horsechief and Tanaya Beatty).They are soon joined by Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike), whose family has been slaughtered by Comanches. Her presence allows Blocker to show his compassionate side and alters the relations between the Cheyenne and the soldiers. The existence of a common enemy — those Comanches, whose aggression offends both Blocker and Yellow Hawk — creates a cautious, tactical alliance that foreshadows a more comprehensive settling of differences.ImageRosamund Pike in ""Hostiles.""CreditLorey Sebastian/Entertainment StudiosThe marauding Comanches are not the only villains. “Hostiles” is committed to evenhandedness and so introduces some bad white men into the mix. These include a rapacious band of fur trappers and a disgraced soldier (Ben Foster), who faces hanging as punishment for his indiscriminate killing of natives. As he points out, what he is condemned for having done is no different from what Blocker has spent his career doing. Only times and government policies have changed.“Hostiles,” for all its earnest maneuvering to stay both true to history and on the right side of it, nonetheless sits a bit uncomfortably in the present. It is unlikely to escape notice that this is yet another tale of a white man’s conscience, which uses Yellow Hawk and his children and grandchildren as vehicles for Blocker’s awakening. Whether this awakening is complete and whether the film’s final notes of absolution are fully earned are matters worth arguing about.And “worth arguing about” is not a bad verdict. “Hostiles” is elegantly made, with picturesque cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi and a muscular, old-style score by Max Richter. Mr. Cooper has regained his confidence after the mess of “Black Mass.” The performances are appropriately stoical, and Mr. Bale, Ms. Pike and Mr. Studi share the ability to evoke people from an earlier time without dimming their movie-star charisma.“Hostiles” itself wants to be both a throwback and an advance, not so much a new kind of western as every possible kind — vintage, revisionist, elegiac, feminist. What makes the movie interesting is the sincerity and intelligence with which it pursues that ambition, heroically unaware that the mission is doomed from the start."

The movie is taken from 30 hours of interviews with Brunhilde Pomsel, who served as a secretary to Joseph Goebbels and was 103 when the film was shot. (She died in January at 106.)Like “Blind Spot: Hitler’s Secretary,” which centered on the recollections of Traudl Junge, “A German Life” lets viewers consider its subject — her anecdotes, body language and face (often shot in close-up) — and decide how much to believe her. The words of Ms. Pomsel, who is remarkably lucid for a centenarian, are intercut with quotations from Goebbels and archival footage from both sides of the war. Viewers are implicitly invited to ponder the contrast.“I’m not the kind of person to resist,” she says at one point, adding, “I’m one of the cowards.” Noting that nobody believes her, she says she only learned about “the matter of the Jews” when she returned from Russian prison camps after the war. Yet one of the recurring characters in her stories is a Jewish friend, Eva Löwenthal, whom records indicate was deported to Auschwitz and, in 1945, declared dead.Ms. Pomsel’s obituary noted her contradictory statements in this film and other interviews. “I didn’t do anything but type in Goebbels’s office,” she says near the movie’s end. “And I had no idea of what was behind all that. Well, very little, anyway.”"

This intermittently diverting movie is adapted from a 1949 Agatha Christie novel, and it’s several degrees more engaging than another recent Christie-based movie, “Murder on the Orient Express.” But it’s still slight.Max Irons plays the young private eye Charles Hayward, who gets a visit in his dingy office from the beautiful Sophia (Stefanie Martini), an old love whose grandfather, an unpopular tycoon, has shuffled off this mortal coil under unusual circumstances. After consulting with the vinegary Scotland Yard hand Chief Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp, always welcome), Charles sets out to the estate, filled with aunts, sons, in-laws and others, embodied by an all-star cast including Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Gillian Anderson and Christina Hendricks. Ms. Hendricks, her distinctive red hair here a vermilion that borders on magenta, plays an ex-showgirl who is the last wife of the dead old man.The movie’s director, Gilles Paquet-Brenner, worked on the adaptation with Julian Fellowes, writer of Robert Altman’s acclaimed 2001 mansion mystery “Gosford Park.” At its best, as when Ms. Hendricks swans around her cavernous bedroom bopping to early rock ’n’ roll records, the movie feels like a version of “Gosford Park” taken over by François Ozon. But “Crooked House” is not so often this giddy. The superb cast provides mild pleasures, as do some aspects of the elaborate mystery itself. And that’s all, folks."

A more stunning film landscape than this one, Canada’s Banff National Park in Alberta, is hard to find.This is the home that the wealthy Catharine Robb (the Canadian actress Julie Lynn Mortensen), a Boston debutante, is drawn to, the home where her art school classmate Peter Whyte (Juan Riedinger) grew up, close to the land and with tight ties to the native Stoney Nakoda people. This independent film, directed by Markus Rupprecht, who was also one of the authors of the screenplay, is a fictionalized biography of this couple, and a story that might be new to audiences in the United States.A mild film, “Drawing Home” could use an electrical charge, or an undercurrent of urgency. The pacing is uneven, and the movie feels slow in spots and too long overall, even though it lacks detail that would have enriched it. An internet search offers a fuller idea about the real lives of the subjects.It takes a long time to bring the two together, and to free Catharine from the clutches of her mother (Kate Mulgrew), who wants to cement Catharine’s relationship with that emblem of East Coast prosperity John D. Rockefeller III. In contrast, Peter and Catharine’s life together, the presumed heart of the story, is fleeting and only lightly sketched, especially when times are hard.Photographs of Catharine that serve to cover the final years of her life are no substitute for what the movie might have shown us."

This time, the killer carves letters into the victims’ bodies, spelling out a message in a tribute to the children’s word game Hangman. The slick, music video-style opening credits — a staple of this genre since “Seven” — include an ominous box of crayons.Mr. Pacino plays Ray, a veteran detective who, after being implicated by the killer, comes out of retirement to investigate with his former colleague Will (Karl Urban), a haunted ex-F.B.I. agent. Will is being shadowed by a New York Times journalist (Brittany Snow) who has returned to her hometown to report on what policing is like there and just happens to luck into a serial killer, as if chasing psychopaths with fiendishly convoluted plans were all that heart-of-America cops did.The killer’s linguistic skills aren’t his only talent.

We are reintroduced to the group’s reluctant leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick), as she quits a demeaning record label job. In the same vein, Chloe (Brittany Snow) endures veterinary school, while Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) coasts on her Fat Amy Winehouse impersonation. Discouraged by the demands of the real world, the larger-than-life Bellas reunite to join a U.S.O. tour, where they vie to perform as the opening act for the record producer DJ Khaled (appearing as himself).With the Bellas removed from their natural collegiate habitat, the a cappella competitions that once drove the series feel out of place. Though there is novelty in casting a contemporary artist like DJ Khaled in the movie’s kingmaker role, his presence is a reminder that the demands of real-world pop are very different from the demands of this franchise’s fantasy version of a cappella. Watching the Bellas mash together pop songs without sound mixing or instruments in Khaled’s presence feels at best obligatory and at worst embarrassing.“Pitch Perfect 3” fares best when its director, Trish Sie, treats it as a fantastical buddy comedy. A side plot reuniting Fat Amy with her degenerate father (John Lithgow) nearly takes over the movie when Amy’s father kidnaps the Bellas. What follows is the film’s funniest scene, as the suddenly spry Amy, in an attempt to save her friends, refashions sausages into nunchucks and sandwich tinfoil into explosives. In another divergence, the Bellas destroy a hotel suite, releasing a swarm of bees and lighting curtains on fire to the horror of party guests.With a plot as unfocused as its freshly graduated characters, the shaggy “Pitch Perfect 3” gets by on karaoke logic: What makes for a good time isn’t the song you sing, but the company you keep."

Barnum Smaller Than Life","The film has the ingredients of a splashy good time — the charismatic Hugh Jackman, for one — but it fast becomes a standard-issue holiday biopic.","2017-12-20","2017-12-20","2018-01-20 17:44:01",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/movies/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman.html,Read the New York Times Review of The Greatest Showman,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/09/arts/20thegreatestshowman1/greatest1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.”What fun is that?Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.”“The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right.“Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that.Not much time is wasted on Barnum’s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories.Playing the role of a skeptical theater critic as the joyless foil to the giddy fun inspired by Barnum, Paul Sparks maintains a stern deadpan, the way reviewers in movies do. As Barnum’s wife, Charity, Michelle Williams gazes adoringly, until rumors in the press of his affair with Ms. Lind prompt her eyelids to fall in disappointment.The repercussions of this domestic drama are predictable, but at least they do lead to a delightful redemptive scene (one of the movie’s few pleasingly dreamlike moments), when Barnum uses an elephant as a New York taxi to make an appointment on time. It’s utter nonsense — imagine finding a parking space — but that’s exactly what a movie about the self-proclaimed “Prince of Humbugs” needs."

The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen’s console, something strange happens.The movie cuts to the present day and introduces four archetypal, irritating teen characters. There’s the smart and awkward Spencer; his former best friend “Fridge,” now a high school football star who makes Spencer do his homework; the selfie-obsessed popular girl, Bethany; and Martha, who’s a diluted variation of Allison, the smartest and angriest girl in the room in “The Breakfast Club.” And much like in that movie, these kids all get detention together.At first, I presumed that the film’s increased attention on these teenagers was to make us that much more eager for the stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black to show up. There’s good news and bad news: We meet the marquee names shortly after detention. Only they are portraying those same irritating teen characters.I’ll explain. The actual teens discover the discarded video game console in the detention room. They plug it in, the game boots up, and the kids choose their characters. Then they get sucked into the game, where they, among other things, meet the fellow who got sucked into the game 20 years before.The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens’ avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.Their adventure often asks, “What would Steven Spielberg do?” It then answers poorly. (The movie’s director, Jake Kasdan, happens to be the son of Lawrence Kasdan, who worked as a screenwriter with Mr. Spielberg on “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”) The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right. Ms. Gillan, the lesser-known quantity of the group, has to work harder as the geeky teen comes to enjoy living, even if temporarily, in a bombshell adult package. She does commendable work both satirizing, and also fulfilling, a sexist conception."

Arguing poverty, Auralie’s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan’s on the cover of his landmark album “Blonde on Blonde.” That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl “somewhere in Virginia,” according to a title card, in 1982.Written and directed by Colette Burson, “Permanent” uses hair and hairstyles as a metaphor for self-worth. Besides Auralie’s unfortunate situation, Jim, a former Air Force One steward now trying to get through med school, is attached to a very unconvincing toupee. The metaphor goes limp after about 20 minutes. This family comedy then flails about, serving up coming-of-age anecdotes involving mean girls, karate classes and sexually predatory boys. One new “friend” of Auralie’s is eager to show her his penis (what is it with guys, anyway?), which, he insists, looks like E.T. The movie wraps up by cashing in on an interracial friendship subplot for Auralie, a putative feel-good flourish that just feels unearned, to say the least.As the parents, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Arquette seem just about as tired as the characters they’re playing. As Auralie, Ms. McLean is appealing and fresh-faced and could do well in a better coming-of-age movie in a few years."

On a November night in 1953, Frank Olson, a civilian scientist who worked at a United States Army research laboratory near Frederick, Md., died after falling from a hotel-room window in Manhattan.The circumstances of his death — initially classified as an accident — remained murky until 1975, when Olson’s family received an explanation and an apology from the government. His widow and three children were offered a monetary settlement and given an audience at the White House with President Ford. It was disclosed that Olson had been unwittingly dosed with LSD as part of a secret C.I.A. experiment, and that a bad reaction to the drug had caused him to commit suicide.Wormwood | Official Trailer [HD] | NetflixCreditCreditVideo by NetflixThis widely reported revelation was shocking at the time, but it also belonged to a welcome moment of post-Vietnam, post-Watergate reckoning with official lies and secrets. What happened to Olson was surely regrettable, but the belated official acknowledgment of wrongdoing could be seen as commendable. Everyone involved was sorry, and it wouldn’t happen again.But what if that transparency was itself part of a larger cover-up? What if the display of accountability put on by the military and the C.I.A. was actually the opposite — a false confession intended to distract attention from a far more sinister crime? Those are the questions that Mr. Morris pursues. They are the questions that have haunted his main interview subject, Frank Olson’s oldest son, Eric, for more than 60 years.Varying his usual head-on methods, Mr. Morris often films himself and Mr. Olson in a two-shot, facing each other across a room in Mr. Olson’s childhood home. A clock on the wall is permanently stopped between 2:30 and 2:35, the approximate time of Frank Olson’s death. The conversations — at times strangely buoyant, given the gravity of the topics under discussion — are interwoven with old photographs, home movies and television clips.They also, more strikingly, give way to re-enactments of what is known or believed to have happened in the days just before and after Frank Olson’s death. Peter Sarsgaard plays him as a troubled man with a sensitive face and a gentle demeanor, and he’s surrounded by other well-known character actors (including Bob Balaban and Tim Blake Nelson) in what can feel like a lost, unfinished Hitchcock movie. The world of the 1950s is a somber swirl of cigarette smoke and dark shadows, where people speak in whispered riddles, drink martinis and drive around in hulking automobiles. Olson seems like a quintessentially Hitchcockian wrong man, a relative innocent sucked into a vortex of conspiracy and preyed upon by men with sinister agendas and dubious scruples.For Eric, he is more like the paternal ghost in “Hamlet,” which makes Eric the melancholy Danish prince. Scenes from Laurence Olivier’s screen adaptation of the play flicker into view now and then, enriching both the psychological and the visual texture of “Wormwood” (and providing, along with the Book of Revelation, a source for its title.) This is, like “Hamlet,” a tragedy at once public and intimate, an examination of how the impersonal violence of the state can damage and distort individual lives.ImageIn film, Peter Sarsgaard portrays Frank Olson, a civilian scientist who worked at an Army research laboratory and died after falling from a hotel window in 1953. The circumstances of his death have remained murky.CreditZach Dilgard/NetflixEric Olson, who has a Ph.D in psychology from Harvard, does not come across as temperamentally prone to obsession, or intellectually inclined toward conspiracy theories. His fundamental sanity makes his story all the more heartbreaking: like Hamlet, he has been driven to the brink of madness by doubts and suspicions that no amount of investigation can assuage. Mr. Morris, one of the great sleuths of modern cinema (who many years ago worked as a private detective), brings to “Wormwood” a long acquaintance with the slipperiness of truth and the deceptions of power. He listens with the patient attentiveness of a therapist and the quizzical intensity of a gumshoe.For the audience, he is equally shamus and shaman, chasing down clues and trying to exorcise demons that plague the body politic. The LSD story, he and Mr. Olson conclude, was a plausible fairy tale: not exactly untrue, but very far from the whole truth. They illuminate longstanding forensic doubts about the idea that Frank Olson jumped from the window, and theorize that something even darker than mind-control techniques and brainwashing — biological warfare; state-sanctioned murder — lay behind his death. They enlist the help of the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who somehow both supplies and withholds the corroboration they need for their theories.“Wormwood” is haunted by doubleness. It’s a work of journalism and of imagination, of history and portraiture, of indignation and melancholy. (It’s also, simultaneously, a movie and a mini-series, streaming in six episodes on Netflix.) As such, it takes time to absorb, and invites repeated, obsessive watching. Mr. Olson and Mr. Morris make claims that are vitally important — about the credibility of the United States government during the Cold War and ever since — in a spirit that seems more weary than urgent. Mr. Morris presents a powerful historical argument in the guise of a beguiling work of cinematic art — and vice versa."

As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.Were it not for the director’s steady hand and adamantine focus on her destination, this ambition could have been the film’s undoing. Instead, its scope is stirring, the gradual accumulation of insult and outrage reaching far beyond tiny Abbeville where the crime occurred and where Recy, then 24, lived with her husband and new daughter. The miracle, though, is that the movie isn’t a diatribe. Its voices — including several members of Recy’s family and that of Rosa Parks herself, who investigated the assault — are gentle and persuasive, using the horrific details of the rape and its aftermath as ballast to stabilize a heart-wrenching history of systemic injustice.The cleverness of this structure only gradually becomes apparent as Ms. Buirski slowly obliterates skin tone distinctions to land on a perfectly calibrated final section. Some may chide her, not without cause, for overreaching; yet the emotional impact of her deep-diving images — especially the astonishing clips from the “race films” of the 1940s and earlier — is profound. An evocative shot of a black woman in a white dress, fleeing from someone in graceful terror, reminds us repeatedly of the movie’s original atrocity.“They played in her body,” Recy’s sister Alma Daniels says at one point. It’s perhaps the most devastating claim in a film overflowing with them."

Mariam Shaar leads a modest food business in Bourj el Barajneh, a refugee camp south of Beirut, Lebanon, comprising decrepit buildings, narrow alleys and a dangerous overhead mishmash of electrical wires. Despite her status as a Palestinian — barred, as with Syrian refugees, from better jobs in Beirut — Ms. Shaar grows her company, Soufra (which means a table of delicious plenty), with other women struggling to transcend their social station.Crisply directed by Thomas Morgan, the film depicts a succession of challenges facing Ms. Shaar, a smart, understated and tenacious entrepreneur. Soufra begins as a company that races to raise Kickstarter money (with assistance from the Saudi philanthropical concern Alfanar), then expands into schools, upscale gatherings and a farmer’s market, and finally into a food truck, the acquisition of which provides much of the movie’s tension. Fortunately, Ms, Shaar has resourceful and engaged helpers — including the good-humored Ghada Masrieh and diligent Abeer Hassan Almassry — who share her determination and persistence. “You realize your worth,” says Manal Hassan, a mother of five, of working for Soufra. “Especially in these times, women can do anything.”After an initial rejection, Ms. Shaar waits — and waits and waits — for government licenses to purchase the truck, and we see not only the prejudice facing Palestinians in Beirut but also those facing women in particular. Still, she persists, learning to drive, buying culinary technology for the vehicle, and establishing a stand. Ultimately, Ms. Shaar’s triumphs seem boundless."

There is a pig who sails a boat, a team of father-and-son garbage-scavenging rats, a little fox named Little Fox and a dog who is training to be a police officer.But this is not a cute movie, and while it will intrigue many 10- and 11-year-olds, younger children are likely to be more than a little freaked out. Its enchantments are dark, its ideas somber and brutal. Adapted by Pedro Rivero and Alberto Vázquez from Mr. Vázquez’s graphic novel, the film, originally called “Psiconautas” (“Psychonauts”), conjures a bleak vision of a post- or perhaps mid-apocalyptic landscape of predation, addiction and demonic possession. So maybe it’s actually the perfect children’s entertainment for 2017.Birdboy is a creature with an enormous round head and a tiny beak who dresses in a black suit, white shirt and skinny tie, like a member of the “Reservoir Dogs” cast or of an ’80s ska revival band. The lighthouse he once called home is infested by demonic birds, so he flaps around looking for drugs and trying not to get shot.The island where he and the other animals live has been blighted by a nuclear accident. The trees are bare, and the population is divided between a countryside of tidy houses, forests and open fields, and an industrial zone heaped with refuse and ruled by the law of the jungle. Life is pretty awful for everyone. Dinky, who is more or less the heroine of the story (and turns out to be Birdboy’s former girlfriend), quietly seethes in the company of her grotesque mother and stepfather. Her schoolmate Sandra is tormented by voices in her head. Their friend Little Fox is bullied.A lot of incident is packed into a 76-minute running time, giving “Birdboy” the scale of a miniature epic. It’s a little too much, and especially toward the end, the delicate originality of the imagery gives way to familiar movie tropes. (The final moments jarringly evoke “Avatar,” of all things.) But the simple precision of the hand-drawn characters and of the watercolor world they inhabit provide visual coherence and establish an atmosphere of fascination as well as dread. The movie is an anthology of nightmares compressed into a picture book."

Published in 1936 with the Spanish Civil War on the horizon, the book, interpreted as pacifist propaganda, found enemies on both sides.“Ferdinand,” the new computer-animated adaptation from Carlos Saldanha (the “Ice Age” movies), speaks to its own time in a different way, dutifully adhering to the template for contemporary children’s films while avoiding much personality or distinction. The be-yourself messaging is easy to comprehend. A growing-up montage is set to an original Nick Jonas song that sounds like ideal music to get put on hold to. The farm animals represent a cross-section of nations, from a Scottish Highland bull (voiced by David Tennant) to German horses. And the movie is bright and peppy enough to hold young viewers’ attention, though a faithful 1938 Walt Disney short showed more inventiveness in eight minutes.The expanded adventures of Ferdinand (John Cena as an adult) find him encountering new friends, including a misfit goat (Kate McKinnon, whose freewheeling comedy style doesn’t register in the cartoon format) and three hedgehogs (Gina Rodriguez, Daveed Diggs and Gabriel Iglesias). He buries the hatchet with the bulls who bullied him as a child. For some reason, Peyton Manning lends his voice to the one who always has an upset stomach.Unlike in the book, Ferdinand earns the arena’s cheers for not fighting, but the crowd’s sense of surprise will elude audiences attending “Ferdinand.”"

A stalled truck forces the two to take the subway, at which time their city is subject to a very gnarly alien attack.The prospect of a hybrid of “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011) and Andrzev Wajda’s “Kanal” (1956) is not necessarily displeasing, but as it happens, “Beyond Skyline,” written and directed by Liam O’Donnell, is much, much more. (Among other things, it’s a kind of sequel to the 2010 film “Skyline,” for which Mr. O’Donnell was one of the two screenwriters, retaining its aliens but jettisoning its characters.)Fleeing the invaders via subway tunnels doesn’t work, so soon Mark, Trent and a few stock types are in an alien ship, besieged by fearsome creatures with tentacles that unscrew the tops of human heads. One of the captives is a blind Vietnam vet, which is interesting, because eventually the alien ship crashes in Laos, right on the Mekong River, where Mark must protect the newborn he delivered on the ship. (Long story.) The movie, which lists several Asian companies as co-producers, then morphs into a sci-fi martial arts picture, featuring a scene in which a woman lures a giant alien beast into a minefield.Whether you find this as much fun to watch as it is to describe will depend on your tolerance for clichés in dialogue (“I’m so sorry your family is gone. But killing yourself … is not gonna change that”), music (lots of string sections syncopating in high register) and much else. Also in how credible you find Mr. Grillo as an action star.

His 2006 film, “Legend of the Black Scorpion,” was a sumptuous, “Hamlet”-derived, martial arts period piece. “If You Are the One” from 2008 was a romantic comedy set against the backdrop of entrepreneurial wealth. And last year’s “I Am Not Madame Bovary” was a not-quite-successful formal experiment in adapting a best-selling novel.His new film, “Youth,” based on a Yan Geling novel, is about a People’s Liberation Army dance troupe in the early 1970s. Western viewers will detect resonances of “Stage Door” and “The Way We Were” in the story, which largely focuses on the disdainful treatment received by the newcomer He Xiaoping (Miao Miao), a girl from a poor background who’s been recruited by the heroic, idealistic Liu Feng (Huang Xuan). During the Sino-Vietnamese war, the entertainers are forced to become warriors and medics.The movie’s depiction of cultural change is tidy to the point of being facile, which isn’t to say it’s ineffective. (It seems to have ruffled some feathers in its native country, where its release, intended for September, was held up until recently.) One shot late in the film, after Mao’s death, shows a soldier in profile stepping in front of a bright red billboard — one that advertises Coca-Cola rather than the glories of Communist rule.As a straight, sentimental melodrama, “Youth” works well. While there are a lot of conventional tropes, the cast enacts them with such fresh, tenderhearted sincerity that they regain some power."

Ms. Haysom pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact, but Mr. Soering has maintained that he is not guilty and that he gave a false confession, later recanted, to protect Ms. Haysom, counting on his father’s status as a diplomat to shield him.Over the years, Mr. Soering has won allies who have contended his innocence or argued for his repatriation to Germany, where he holds citizenship. The documentary, which features a lengthy prison interview with him, is hardly the first reconsideration of the case. (In 2010, while serving as the state’s governor, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia recommended approval of Mr. Soering’s request to be sent to Germany, where he would serve in prison, though Mr. Kaine’s successor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, reversed that decision.) The movie’s existence and findings have been mentioned in lengthy examinations of the crime in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.Marcus Vetter and Karin Steinberger’s sprawling documentary probably dives into the weeds too quickly and could have used a tighter edit. Still, drawing on a wealth of courtroom video, the film lays out a persuasive argument for reasonable doubt.Those who contribute information favorable to Mr. Soering include Gail Marshall, a former deputy attorney general of Virginia, and Chuck Reid, one of the original investigators. Mr. Soering comes across as a sincere and canny camera presence. He advises the filmmakers to shoot all they can. “You never know whether this will be allowed again,” he says."

When Alex’s boss (an entertainingly smarmy Tim Heidecker) assigns him to a ceremony at a seaside Mexican vacation spot, Alex recruits Justin to assist, despite Justin’s complete inexperience. And off they go, first to the wrong resort, and then to an assortment of colorful characters, including a nervous groom (Nick Flanagan) facing a financial meltdown; the bride’s erratic father (David John Phillips); a best man (Nick Thorburn) who covets the bride; and the bride’s randy sister (the comedian Jackie Pirico), all skillfully portrayed.Pavan Moondi — the Toronto filmmaker who wrote, edited and directed “Sundowners” — is fond of setups without payoffs: an exchange between Justin and his ex-girlfriend (Leah Fay Goldstein) about her abortion is not followed up; the best man’s ambition to interrupt the vows is not acted upon; a suggestion from Justin that he and Alex ultimately remain in Mexico instead of returning to their unrewarding routine is shot down.

A psycho-in-the-woods tale whose villain is more funny-looking than alarming, this debut effort from the director Sam Patton is notable mainly for the beautifully organic performances of its two female leads. In tandem with Matt Anderson and Michael Larson-Kangas’s surprisingly sensitive script, the women create a believably intimate bond between their beleaguered characters.Both are unsettled from the outset. Abby (Jaimi Paige), recently widowed, is struggling to reconcile her grief with that of her 13-year-old son, Sam (Toby Nichols). At the same time, her longtime friend Jen (Alyshia Ochse) is surveying the emotional gaps in her own life and mulling a major decision. All three have hiked into the wilderness to scatter the deceased’s ashes on his favorite mountain; behind them, a hooded stranger (Claude Duhamel) silently follows.For a long time, this mystery stalker does little but lurk, periodically releasing spooky blasts of vintage music — presumably to get his hack-’em-up mojo going. Though with neither dialogue nor obvious motivation, he’s less a character than an abstract mechanism to force an emotional catharsis: a trigger for mother and son to reboot and reconnect.This repeated tilt toward tenderness slackens the tension, and, as Andi Obarski’s camera sweeps swiftly past the nasty bits, we sense that neither she nor her director is gung-ho for gore. Instead, they give their leads a gift rarely bestowed on attractive young women in horror movies: to be observed without being fetishized."

John Wayne delivers that same admonition in “Rio Bravo,” Howard Hawks’s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful, autocratic rancher. (Wayne’s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy, played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways, that film and other classics from the western canon inform “Lefty Brown,” which opens one dark, stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889, the year it became the 41st state.One of the foundational themes of the western is the making of America, an origin story that plays out in tales about frontiers, borders, wagon trains, settlements, railroads, towns, cowboys and Indians. Invariably, these are narratives of violent transformations in which land becomes property and some people become citizens while others remain outlaws or are turned into permanent exiles. In “Lefty Brown,” those changes have already affected a Montana rancher, Edward Johnson (Peter Fonda), who has recently been elected a senator and is headed east. He’s a classic type, the outsider as insider who, as he tells his wife, Laura (Kathy Baker), is “going to take on all of Washington.”ImageMr. Pullman as Lefty on his journey.CreditA24/DirecTVSome 10 minutes into the film, though, a villain fatally derails Edward’s plans, spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward’s longtime hand, Lefty (Bill Pullman), of failing her husband. (“You were supposed to watch his back,” a grieving Laura tells an apologetic, equally bereft Lefty. “Sorry don’t get it done.”) Lefty sets off to find Edward’s killer, a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler, Jeremiah (Diego Josef), who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels, some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty’s past.The writer-director Jared Moshé takes his time in “Lefty Brown,” which meanders here and there for close to two hours, ranging over picturesque, Big Sky landscapes while rambling deeper into prickly narrative complications. If there isn’t much urgency it’s partly because Lefty has been rather too closely modeled on the irascible if endearing coots played by the likes of Walter Brennan. Often grizzled comic relief, though sometimes tragic, these sidemen stand in the long, tall shadow of the hero, giving him grief while always following his lead. They’re loyal dogs, surrogate nannies, maybe close pals. They’re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Moshé has given Lefty.Like Brennan’s character, Stumpy, in “Rio Bravo,” Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens’s warble, too.) At times, Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations, which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie’s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time, as the too familiar story of good men and bad, loyalty and betrayal emerges, these allusions can remind you that you’re not watching Howard Hawks. Instead, Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up, and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns.Mr. Pullman, his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops, keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Moshé knows his genre. There’s beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures, typified by Jeremiah’s love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Lefty’s future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbanks’s would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film “Wild and Woolly.” Even so, while Mr. Moshé’s ambitions can be frustratingly modest, he does know that — however fraudulent the genre’s myths — the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA."

The Resistance — an intrepid, multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior — has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” picks up where the story left off two years ago in “The Force Awakens,” the leadoff of the series’ newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each “Star Wars” title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren’t made in story-chronological order), but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of “The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson, frontloads the critical back story intel — who’s fighting who and the like — in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship.VideoRian Johnson narrates a battle sequence from his film, which is now available on digital.Published OnMarch 15, 2018CreditCreditWalt Disney Studios Motion PicturesMr. Johnson largely succeeds despite having inherited an elaborate ecosystem with a Manichaean worldview divided between heroes (a.k.a. the Resistance) and villains (the First Order). That’s about all you need to know to follow this movie, which charts the franchise’s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity — Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill — to a new trio, introduced in “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Ford’s character, Han Solo, exited the series in that movie. As Leia, Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one, but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined — if not always comfortably — by loss.And so, once upon a time yet again, peace remains elusive and weapons are locked, loaded and often firing. Here, the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother, Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill), while leading the Resistance against the First Order, the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader’s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects), a wormy, towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader.The story is a tangle, but its complications are mitigated by Mr. Johnson’s quick pace and the appealing performers. Like most contemporary action flicks, this one more or less plays out as a succession of fights, chases and time outs (for chatting, scheming or lonely musing) across two or more plot lines. Having joined together in “The Force Awakens,” the story’s latest dream team — Rey (Daisy Ridley), a scavenger turned warrior; Finn (John Boyega), a First Order deserter turned resister; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a Resistance fighter pilot — now often spends time apart. Poe spins in Leia’s orbit while Rey pesters Luke, and Finn finds a winning ally (Kelly Marie Tran).An early heroic death sets the sober mood and stakes while gently re-establishing the franchise’s new commitment to diversifying the overall picture. As in “The Force Awakens,” this inclusion feels natural, a vision of the future you can recognize. About the only time it feels as if Mr. Johnson is checking “Star Wars” boxes is in some of the fights, especially during an impasse that turns into a slow-moving game of space chess. He may be checking off some of those boxes in an ode to George Lucas; whatever the case, Mr. Johnson only infrequently comes across as dutiful or as overtly brand-expanding (as with a troika of calculatingly cute tykes who unnervingly suggest this series really will go on forever).ImageDaisy Ridley as Rey, one of a new generation of heroes introduced in “The Force Awakens.”CreditJonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesOne of the truisms of the “Star Wars” series is that its battle between good and bad has always uneasily and sometimes openly mirrored the attendant struggle between good and bad filmmaking. Mr. Lucas’s 1977 foundational movie mostly transcends its flaws with slick looks, hooky effects, old-school heroics and loads of marketable material that helped turn fan love into an ecumenical cult. The second trilogy, entirely directed by Mr. Lucas, began in 1999 with “The Phantom Menace” (infamous for the minor scandal called Jar Jar Binks) and is pretty much a drag outside of some fleet light-saber duels and the arresting black-and-red patterning that distinguishes one villain.Part of what has already made the new trilogy more successful is that its directors, J.J. Abrams (“The Force Awakens”) and Mr. Johnson, are technically adept, commercially savvy “Star Wars” true believers who came of age in the post-Lucas blockbuster era. Each has had to navigate the intricacies of Mr. Lucas’s sprawling fiction while handling the deep imprint created by Darth Vader’s heavy-breathing menace, R2-D2’s amusing beeps, Mr. Ford’s insouciance, Mr. Hamill’s earnestness, and Ms. Fisher’s smarts and latter-day screwball charm. Unlike Mr. Lucas, though, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson don’t feel burdened by that legacy; they’re into it, charged up, despite the pressures of such an industrial enterprise. They’re resolving their cinematic father issues with a sense of fun.ImageMark Hamill’s moody Luke Skywalker has retreated to a lovely, isolated island.CreditWalt Disney Studios Motion PicturesMr. Johnson can make you forget about those issues as well as the franchise’s insistent obligations; it also seems like he had a good time at work. He brings lightness to his banter, visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design, and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren’s relationship. Mr. Johnson’s use of deep red is characteristic of how he turns ideas into images, most vividly with a set that looks like something Vincente Minnelli might have dreamed up for a Flash Gordon musical with Gene Kelly. When that set becomes the backdrop to a viscerally exciting fight, all the red abruptly evokes the spilled blood that this otherwise squeaky clean series insistently elides.Like “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” engages with the first “Star Wars” movie less as a fetish than as a necessary point of departure. And, like Alec Guinness’s Obi-Wan Kenobi once did, Luke comes off as a brooding monastic loner. With a hooded robe, beard and inexplicable moodiness, he has retreated to an eerily lovely, isolated island where imaginatively designed critters roam and trill. The cutest (right in time for Christmas tie-ins) are Porgs, saucer-eyed mewling creatures with plump, puffin-like bodies that are mainly on hand for easy laughs. The creature design throughout is so inventive — there are less-fuzzy whatsits on the island, too — that you wish more had been added.ImageCarrie Fisher’s Leia plays a critical role in “The Last Jedi.”CreditWalt Disney Studios Motion PicturesYou feel Mr. Johnson periodically reining himself in, yet the movie cuts loose when he does, as when he embraces the galaxy’s strangeness, its non-humanoid beings as well as its magic and mystery. There’s a trippy scene in which a character floats into a resurrection, an ethereal drift that borders on the surreal. It’s a fleeting bliss-out in a series that knows how to bring the weird but has too often neglected to do so amid its blaster zapping, machinations and Oedipal stressing and storming. This is, after all, a franchise in which the most indelible character remains Yoda, the wee, far-out philosophizer with the tufted pate and syntactically distinct truth telling: “Wars not make one great.”Wars do, however, make warehouses of money as this franchise has been affirming for decades. It’s instructive how normalized its permanent war has become, with its high body count, bloodlessness and fascist chic (the black uniforms evoking the Nazi SS). Given this, it’s notable, too, that while Mr. Johnson manages the big-canvas battles well enough, he’s better with smaller-scaled fights, in which the sweat, vulnerabilities and personal costs of violence are foregrounded. With Mr. Driver — who delivers a startlingly raw performance — Mr. Johnson delivers a potent portrait of villainy that suggests evil isn’t hard-wired, an inheritance or even enigmatic. Here, it is a choice — an act of self-creation in the service of annihilation.Mr. Johnson has picked up the baton — notably the myth of a female Jedi — that was handed to Mr. Abrams when he signed on to revive the series with “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Johnson doesn’t have to make the important introductions; for the most part, the principals were in place, as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so, he has to convince you that these searching, burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally, not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard, and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness, the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he’s made a good movie in doing so isn’t icing; it’s the whole cake."

It focuses on Kiet Engels, a teacher introduced as she methodically sets up her classroom for another day. What separates her class from those in other Dutch villages is that her students are migrant children, many of them Syrian. So in addition to the usual curriculum of reading, writing and arithmetic, Miss Kiet gently but determinedly instructs them in the hard work of assimilation, teaching them in Dutch and encouraging them to play with Dutch children.Petra Lataster-Czisch and Peter Lataster direct the film in a fly-on-the-wall style; the young students don’t seem bothered by the camera, at least in the footage used. And as the movie progresses, a handful of precocious personalities emerge. There is Haya, who appoints herself a mentor for a new girl, Leanne, and assists her with penmanship in a way that crosses the line from helping to bossing around. (Miss Kiet sees what’s going on and intervenes.) And there is Jorj, whose younger brother, Maksim, clings to him, who sulks when he’s told he needs to take off his outdoor shoes for gym and who struggles with math.As in Nicolas Philibert’s similar French documentary “To Be and to Have” (2002), the relative absence of conflict in the interactions between a seasoned teacher and wonderful pupils grows tedious at feature length, and there is — presumably by design — relatively little meat on this documentary’s bones. We learn nothing about how the school runs or why it’s a locus for refugees. The film includes only incidental tidbits about the students’ lives outside the classroom or before their arrival in the Netherlands, although in a charged moment late in the film, Miss Kiet asks Jorj about his life in Syria, where he played football inside the house to avoid what he calls the “bang, bang” outside.“Miss Kiet’s Children” may seem soft and insubstantial in isolation, but it’s worth remembering that the movie was made before the far-right politician Geert Wilders fell short of gaining the seats his party sought in the 2017 Dutch election. Nor is the movie’s message limited to Holland. At Film Forum, “Miss Kiet’s Children” will screen with a Norwegian short that is animated in a style that suggests Jacob Lawrence and is drawn from interviews with children from Ivory Coast."

This isn’t even the first time two guys have battled for Ms. Russo’s favor in a film written and directed by Ron Shelton.The humor is self-defeating, though, since this wheezy romantic caper — with Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman as the rival suitors — inspires little more than melancholy reminiscences of Mr. Shelton’s earlier work. Male competition, in sports and romance, has been his chief interest as a screenwriter and a filmmaker, and it has yielded some pretty good work over the years. “Bull Durham” and “White Men Can’t Jump,” most memorably, but also underrated entertainments like “Tin Cup” (in which Ms. Russo was the prize sought by Kevin Costner and Don Johnson) and “Hollywood Homicide,” which hold up better than you might expect.This one should be better than it is. There were no advance screenings for critics — never a promising sign — but I bought a ticket and sat in a Manhattan theater with a half-dozen other oddballs over the weekend and a flicker of hope in my heart. The cast includes, in addition to the three points of the romantic triangle mentioned above, such fine comic and character performers as George Wallace, Joe Pantoliano, Elizabeth Ashley and Jane Seymour. Johnny Mathis is in it, too! How dire could it be?Plenty dire, and not in a way that’s any fun to contemplate. The premise has some farcical potential. Mr. Freeman is Duke Diver, the manager of a Palm Springs retirement community with some unsavory secrets in his past. Someone is trying to kill him, but that’s the least of his troubles. The big one is the arrival of Leo McKay, a Texas big shot with a military background and a hidden agenda. He parks his pickup truck in Duke’s designated spot, wins Duke’s money in a poker game and moves in on Duke’s trio of friends with benefits (Glenne Headly, Ms. Ashley and Sheryl Lee Ralph). And then Suzie Quince (Ms. Russo) shows up to audit Duke’s books and accelerate the plot.Which sadly does not happen. In spite of the charm and discipline of the stars, the jokes misfire and the scenes creak and stumble. That it all takes place around Christmas time in the desert just makes everything sadder. “Just Getting Started,” which should skip and sprint, feels slow and interminable, as if someone were reciting the plot of a Ron Shelton movie he or she had seen once on a plane. As soon as it’s underway, you wonder when it will be over."

But the film, which begins and ends with presidential elections — Mr. Obama’s in 2008 and his successor’s eight years later — is shadowed, in some ways haunted, by his presence and his temperament. At one point, he appears on television, in the wake of the massacre of school children and their teachers in Newtown, Conn. “These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods,” he says, referring to the places that have been devastated by gun violence. “These children are our children.”The simple inclusiveness of that idea and the feeling behind it — the sense that this nation, with all of its troubles, is something we’re all in together — may sound especially poignant now, and even a bit quaint. But a similar ethic of solidarity informs every moment of “Quest,” which brings us into the neighborhood and the home of Christopher and Christine’a Rainey and their teenage daughter, PJ.Christopher is also known as Quest, which is the name of the recording studio where he sits behind the mixing boards as local rappers spit their rhymes. Christine’a is Ma Quest, and the two of them, without vanity or any expectation of praise or reward, serve as mentors, confidants and semi-parental figures for the people around them. Mr. Rainey wakes up at dawn to deliver coupon circulars door to door. His wife works long hours at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. If you lived in North Philly, you would want to know them. “Quest” offers the gift of imagining that you do, even as it honors their complicated, sometimes opaque individuality.ImageMr. Rainey with his daughter, PJ.CreditJonathan Olshefski/First Run FeaturesMr. Olshefski doesn’t pry too intrusively into their lives. He and his crew record only what the Raineys are willing to tell and show, and a story takes shape in response to events in their lives. Time flows like a current rather than advancing steadily according to the calendar or the clock. Mr. Obama’s first term passes in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, PJ and her father are talking about Mitt Romney as the 2012 election draws near.Politics is part of their world, and some of the issues that have recently galvanized public debate — health care, addiction, crime, tensions between the police and African-American citizens — figure prominently in “Quest.” Gun violence affects the Raineys with direct and traumatic force, disrupting the film’s calm, contemplative rhythm. (There’s another, blessedly benign twist later on.) The disaster that strikes them is upsetting, and the stoicism with which they keep going is at least equally moving.But the movie doesn’t hold up its subjects as symbols of suffering or as emblems of strength. The Raineys themselves make no such claim: They take pride in the normalcy of their lives. When Christine’a hears Donald J. Trump making a pitch to “the African-Americans” who he believes live in unrelieved squalor, she responds with disgust: “You have no idea how we live.”Is it too much to hope that he watches “Quest”? Its power lies in its attention to the drama of everyday existence, and Mr. Olshefski’s sharp eye for character. We track PJ’s adolescent moods, the tenderness and occasional tension that defines her parents’ relationship, and also the ups and downs of other friends and kin. Ms. Rainey’s older son, William, begins treatment for brain cancer as he’s about to become a father. A talented rapper named Price, one of Mr. Rainey’s creative collaborators and a drug user and alcoholic, squanders his promise and his friend’s good will as he fights his habit.The grace with which the family faces these hardships is the very definition of self-reliance. The hope that they might find some relief — in the form of economic security, a more responsive government, more hours in the day — is what makes “Quest” a deeply political film even as it is heartbreakingly clear about the limits of politics. Mr. Obama’s line about the common American destiny is echoed and complicated in another speech, during an anti-violence rally not far from the Raineys’ home. Noting the absence of pop stars and politicians from the scene — “Where’s Beyoncé now?” “Where’s Rihanna now?” — an activist insists that “our first role models need to be us.” I don’t think I’ve ever heard a more succinct definition of what it means to be a citizen, and I’ve rarely seen a movie about citizenship as quietly eloquent as “Quest.”"

The shudders begin soon after the movie does when a woman opens a door, stares into the camera and falls to the ground. Just one look, and Dafna (Sarah Adler) knows the worst: The soldiers on her doorstep have come bringing death. Her son, Jonathan (Yonatan Shiray), who’s in the army, has been killed. In a whir of motion and fatigue green, they stoop over Dafna, soothing and sedating her, then tucking her in bed. Her husband, Michael (a fantastic Lior Ashkenazi), mutely stares at this scene as if he were a bystander in his own life.It’s a grabber of an opening in a movie that builds into a devastating indictment of a nation, shock by shock, brutal moment by brutal moment. (The movie is Israel’s Oscar entry in the foreign-language category.) Meaning surfaces slowly here in details, flashes of cruelty, glimmers of apathy and a mounting sense of helplessness. First, though, there are parental tears and Dafna and Michael’s handsome, sparsely furnished apartment with its tidy bookshelves and modernist furniture. The biggest room, where Michael lingers while watching Dafna collapse, has a geometrically patterned floor and is so large and precisely arranged that it suggests a showroom. At times, it also evokes a stage.With Dafna asleep in the bedroom, Michael initially suffers and mourns alone. His red eyes watering yet not quite spilling over, he understandably seems to be in shock. The soldiers have tended to him, too, fussing and hovering over him; in one shot, he looks up at them as if he were a child. His brother (Yehuda Almagor), comes by and begins busily arranging a memorial notice. Two women rush in as well, including Michael and Dafna’s daughter (Shira Haas). Everyone plays his or her part. The soldiers re-enter, and one comfortably settles into a chair and rather too blithely proposes funeral arrangements to Michael, sketching in every detail with the fastidious attention of a wedding planner.ImageYonatan Shiray, far right, as a soldier in “Foxtrot.”CreditGiora Bejach/Sony Picture ClassicsThe writer and director Samuel Maoz (“Lebanon”) has an exacting eye. The framing is meticulous; soon it’s also very purposefully working your nerves. Although Michael briefly leaves to tell his mother about Jonathan, much of the movie’s first section unfolds inside the apartment. It’s a cloistered space, made more confining by the tight close-ups of Michael’s face (Mr. Ashkenazi makes mourning palpable in each twitch), his ponderous, near-somnolent movements and several overhead shots of him. These dramatically isolate him in the frame while creating an ambiguous, narratively untethered point of view, as if we were peering at him from a catwalk. Filmmakers call this a God’s-eye view.By the time the first section is over, a near-miracle has occurred. Jonathan turns out to be alive, and after his parents process the news, the story shifts to him. He’s in a remote outpost fulfilling the compulsory military service demanded of most Israelis when they turn 18. Along with three other young men, Jonathan guards a checkpoint, lowering and raising a barrier for the occasional passing car or slow-loping camel. At night, the soldiers train a harsh spotlight on passers-by and check IDs. It’s a dramatically beautiful, seemingly depopulated area, framed by distant mountains and bisected by a single lonely road that seems to stretch on forever yet also to go nowhere.After the intense emotions and physical limitations of the apartment, the checkpoint with its wide-open vistas provides relief. For a moment, if seems as if you can breathe. The soldiers are cute, amusing and very young. They’ve settled into dull, monotonous work — raising the barrier for a camel — that can seem absurd. (What could go wrong?) But they also dance, draw, listen to music, tell stories and entertain one another. The looseness and humor of their interactions are welcome, but there are also new shivers of unease: The soldiers bunk in what looks like a repurposed, derelict shipping container. Everything is falling apart, decaying, and the container is rapidly sinking into the mud.If that sounds like a metaphor, it most likely is. Mr. Maoz doesn’t say, at least through the dialogue. Avoiding speeches and exegesis, he writes characters that talk like ordinary people in everyday life, even as he focuses your attention on their faces, their interactions with others, how they carry themselves, how they withdraw and advance. (You learn more about Michael from how he treats the family dog than from what he says.) Visually, though, Mr. Maoz leans into Expressionism. Michael and Dafna’s apartment, for instance, creates a powerful sense of a purposefully ordered world that is upended by grief; the abject decay surrounding Jonathan says something else entirely.It’s no surprise when violence fully erupts at the checkpoint. It’s been hanging over this movie much as those carefully doting soldiers hovered over Michael and Dafna, telling them, wrongly of course, that their only son had died serving his country. Those soldiers are so good at what they do, Mr. Maoz suggests, because they have so much experience. There’s even a sense, conveyed through their practiced calm and soothing voices, that violence and grief are somehow inevitable, maybe normal. Image by image, and with invocations of history and the Holocaust, Mr. Moaz also suggests that normalizing catastrophic violence — and routinizing mourning — is finally little else than nihilism."

In the director Paul Solet’s endearingly lunkheaded thriller, three thieves, reeling from a partly botched heist, hide in a warehouse whose only other living occupant is a vicious, implacable Canary mastiff.The dog, who gets his own point-of-view shots and flashbacks, has been made violent by a crime boss, Blue (Antonio Banderas). Blue has just cleaned up at a dogfight on the premises and will soon return. (The ring is evidently run by cinephiles; the dogs are named after actors like Clint Eastwood and Robert Mitchum.)All three robbers — Stacy (Adrien Brody), Walker (John Malkovich) and Gage (Rory Culkin) — have histories with pets. This leads to dialogue in which Walker and Stacy discuss the qualities of cat people and dog people (“Being a cat person doesn’t necessarily make you less of a man,” Walker says); how a standard poodle once saved Stacy from being arrested; and the unfortunate incident in which a young Walker intermingled stolen freshwater and saltwater fish.Is “Bullet Head” good? In truth, it’s drab, derivative and more than slightly silly, but it’s tough to dislike a movie that proceeds as if the 1990s cycle of Quentin Tarantino knockoffs never ended and that uses the prospect of gory canine violence in service of loud and persistent pro-dog cheerleading. The closing credits say that a portion of the movie’s proceeds will go toward eliminating dogfighting."

Their mother is long gone, and their jailbird father is still locked up. When Brandon is accused of murder, he disappears, leaving Alison alone to exonerate him.Soon this gloomy family drama, directed and written by Scooter Corkle, transforms into a backwoods thriller littered with bodies and conspiracies.Under the film’s color-drained cinematography, Alison looks tired and pallid as she’s harassed and chased away by locals who despise her family. She looks ready to snap from the first scene on, yet her resolve to find her brother keeps her going. The movie mirrors Alison’s desperation through dimly lit dead-end clues and hectic chase sequences through town.Alison closely resembles Jennifer Lawrence’s character in “Winter’s Bone,” another self-sufficient young woman whose family and community turn against her. This movie is not as tense, but it gets close thanks to Ms. Agron’s resolute performance and the movie’s hostile small town setting. The world may not always be just — those who break things don’t always pick up the pieces — but headstrong women like Alison still survive."

A pernicious bond between the middle-aged Carl (Toby Jones, credibly crushed) and his manipulative mother, Aileen (the grand Anne Reid, passively domineering). A cinematographer (Philipp Blaubach) who pries menace from the mundane and makes even the most generic urban architecture radiate disquiet. And a despondent production design that renders Carl’s drab council flat in shades of bilious green and burial-plot brown.But the script (by Mr. Jones’s brother Rupert Jones, who also directs) is so tricky that, much like Carl, we can’t get a handle on anything. Events and timelines dissolve and reassemble like the crystals in the kaleidoscope of the title — a beloved keepsake, we gather, from an otherwise miserable childhood. A brief prologue has revealed a corpse in his bathroom, and the word “LUST” lingers on his wall calendar. Both have something to do with Abby (Sinead Matthews), a chipper date who shows up after an online encounter and is struck by his lack of possessions: Like all the best serial killers, Carl used a library computer.By the time Aileen appears, injured and in need of shelter, this painful romantic liaison may have turned tragic. Or maybe not: Committing completely to Carl’s wobbly perceptions, the filmmakers mire us in a hackneyed swamp of narrative uncertainty. Save yourself the effort of decipherment, and simply enjoy Mr. Blaubach’s baleful shots of high-rise exteriors and broody, squashed interiors. As Carl’s paranoia swells, his world seems to contract until all that’s left is a room, a bed and a woman he loathes. Possibly."

As a child, she is degraded and smacked around by her mother, who kicks little Tonya’s chair so violently the kid flies off it. When the teenage Tonya gets involved with the man she will marry, her life as a punching bag continues. Her husband smashes her head onto a glass surface so hard that shards scatter; he bloodies her nose a few times. He also points a gun at Tonya, threatening to kill her. Despite all the beatings and blood, “I, Tonya” insists it’s a comedy.The real Tonya Harding went from fame to infamy in 1994, after she was implicated in an attack on Nancy Kerrigan, a rival. On Jan. 6, after practicing for the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, Ms. Kerrigan was attacked by a man who thwacked her leg with a collapsible police baton. (He seems to have been going for her knee.) A camera captured Ms. Kerrigan on the ground as she repeatedly wailed “Why?” Ms. Harding went on to win the championship; it was a short-lived victory. The F.B.I. was soon questioning her, her ex-husband and their dumb-and-dumber associates. By June, Ms. Harding had been barred from competing for her role in the attack.VideoThe director Craig Gillespie narrates a sequence from his film featuring Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding.Published OnJan. 9, 2018CreditCreditNeonEnergetically directed by Craig Gillespie, “I, Tonya” charts the hard-won rise and calamitous fall of its title character (Margot Robbie). Taking the form of a mock, mocking documentary, one that disjointedly swings between heehaw comedy and wincing agony, the movie establishes its raised-eyebrow tone with a title card stating it’s “Based on irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly,” her former husband. (The screenwriter, Steven Rogers, has said that he spoke with both.) From their separate corners, the middle-aged, long-divorced Tonya and Jeff (Sebastian Stan), provide linked, at times vividly contradictory accounts of what happened.In one location, Jeff sits facing the camera in front of a large window framed by photo-covered walls. There’s a lot more visual coding going on with Tonya, who’s plunked down at a table in a modest kitchen wearing a pale jeans jacket and cowboy boots. Lank blond hair and bangs border her face; her neck has gone puffy. Looking into the camera, she occasionally draws on a cigarette and crosses her legs, one big, down-home, country-gal ankle resting on a knee. The real eye-catchers are the dirty dishes stacked in the sink behind her. They stay put and stay dirty, which seems curiously sloppy given that Tonya, a media veteran, is here to tell her truth. If you didn’t know she had a reputation as down-and-dirty, here’s a hint.As Tonya and Jeff offer up alternating stories, her past, her abuse and her triumphs come into view. The only daughter of an unhappily married couple, the young Tonya is a daddy’s girl. Her father takes her hunting, teaching her how to shoot rabbit. Her awful mother, LaVona (Allison Janney, chilled and excellent), is the one who arranges for Tonya to take lessons with a skating coach (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya turns out to be a prodigy and is soon powering her way into the top echelon of the sport, despite the snobbery and visible discomfort of the judges who favor froufrou femininity over aggressive competition. They want gliding princesses, not grunting athletes like Tonya.The story of Tonya Harding has been told before in mainstream journalism and in scholarly accounts, documentaries and a quickie made-for-TV movie that lathered the soap. Before and after the incident, as it’s often called, she was grist for thumb-sucking takes on women, femininity, sports and social class. Before the attack, writers liked to point out that Ms. Harding played pool and drove a truck. In a sympathetic 1992 profile, Sports Illustrated described her as a “hardscrabble, dispossessed kid” who had become “an interloper in the realm of pixies and queens who’s as at home doing a brake job as she is performing an arabesque.” She was Cinderella with edge and muscles.ImageSebastian Stan (as Jeff Gillooly) and Ms. Robbie in “I, Tonya,” whose narrative toggles between she-said and he-said segments.CreditNeonIn “I, Tonya,” she is also an unreliable narrator, just like Jeff. “There’s no such thing as truth,” Tonya announces. “Everyone has their own truth.” The film takes up this statement as its guiding narrative principle, toggling between the she-said and he-said as it hurdles toward its nadir. The older Tonya makes an assertion, and the older Jeff does likewise. The young Tonya — in flashback — says one thing, the young Jeff says something else, and every so often LaVona chimes in. Characters periodically break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and directly addressing the viewer, as if to assert ownership on the unwinding story. Listen to me, each seems to say in these moments.Ms. Robbie takes on the role with vigor and strained toothy smiles, giving an outsize performance that suits the film’s broadness and showy surfaces. (She does much of her own skating, though the trickier moves were completed with stunt doubles and digital effects.) Despite the makeup and a few tragic haircuts, Ms. Robbie remains an unpersuasive fit for the tiny Ms. Harding, who could bench press more than her weight and whose sculptured muscles freaked some out. You could write a treatise on female bodies pegged to the contempt that journalists unloaded on her, especially after the attack, when they called her “white trash” and “old Thunder Thighs.” She was 23.As “I, Tonya” skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs, there’s little about Ms. Harding, her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny. She was poor, grew up in trailers, had a temper, liked loud colors, dropped out of school, traded in one abuser for another and maintained some stupid acquaintances — a clown posse the filmmakers lavish too much time on. She might have played a role in the attack on Ms. Kerrigan, but in many ways Ms. Harding had already been found guilty for just being who she was. The same feels true here.“I, Tonya” asserts that the truth is elusive. Yet some facts are known. Ms. Harding — as was widely reported — took out restraining orders against Mr. Gillooly, telling the police that he had hit her and she was afraid of him. Back then, her abuse was often played down; here, it is countered by scenes in which the tough Tonya fights back, at times with a comedic spin, as if to suggest that she can give as good as she gets. That makes this film and the brutality more breezily watchable, I suppose. Still, it’s instructive that at one point Tonya lectures the audience on its complicity in how she was treated. It’s an impressively disingenuous wag of the finger from a film that has encouraged our laughter right from the start."

Early on in  “Bill Frisell: A Portrait,” Mr. Frisell, a quiet, diffident man, tells an off-camera interviewer that when he gets up in the morning, he picks up a guitar, starts playing “and then …” he drifts off. The suggestion is that he never stops.Directed by Emma Franz, this project has clearly been in the works for a long time. Three of its interviewees, all music greats, have died in recent years: the jazz guitarist Jim Hall, also a teacher of Mr. Frisell’s; the remarkable drummer Paul Motian, with whom Mr. Frisell played in a groundbreaking jazz trio with Joe Lovano; and the wonderful, albeit widely misunderstood, guitarist John Abercrombie, who provides an interesting technical analysis of Mr. Frisell’s style and tone, among the most distinctive and recognizable in contemporary music.I am a fervent fan of Mr. Frisell’s. I’ve been following his work since the mid-1980s; I’ve seen him perform live twice this year, and might try to catch one of his shows this weekend at Jazz Standard.Nevertheless, there are several points in this movie — which I’m still recommending — that I found, if not boring, a little dry. In a sense, Mr. Frisell, 66, is an entirely atypical contemporary musician. As the impresario and record producer Hal Willner notes early in the documentary, despite Mr. Frisell’s having performed or recorded with literally hundreds of other top-flight players and troubadours, “there’s no one who has a bad word to say about him.” Being a “no drama” person is lovely, and it’s particularly salutary that Mr. Frisell upends the myth that the great artist needs to be full of anger, or to behave badly, to be inspired.These qualities, however, don’t always make entirely compelling cinema. A cab ride through London with Mr. Frisell’s former teacher, the composer and conductor Michael Gibbs, is frankly a little drowsy. Once the duo, who are working on a collaborative concert, reach their destination, a radio station, they are directed to a studio called “the Barbarella Room.”On the way there, Mr. Frisell recalls what he remembers as “the only illegal thing” he has ever done: as a 15-year-old, gaining entry to a theatrical screening of “Barbarella,” the very tame, sex-in-outer-space ’60s film starring Jane Fonda, when the movie was restricted to viewers over 16. Which is funny.But the movie is at its liveliest when it depicts Mr. Frisell making his distinctive sound with a variety of colleagues. And, fortunately, Ms. Franz includes a lot of such footage."

Guillermo del Toro, the writer and director, is a passionate genre geek. Sometimes his enthusiasm can get the better of his discipline, producing misshapen (but never completely uninteresting) movies like “Pacific Rim” and “Crimson Peak.” At his best, though — in “The Devil’s Backbone,” “Pan’s Labyrinth” and now, at last, again — he fuses a fan’s ardor with a romantic sensibility that is startling in its sincerity. He draws on old movies, comic books, mythic archetypes and his own restless visual imagination to create movies that seem less made than discovered, as if he had plucked them from the cultural ether and given them color, voice and form.The most obvious reference point for “The Shape of Water” is “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” a Cold War-era camp-horror classic about a strange beast, quasi-fish and sort-of human, discovered in the rain forests of the Amazon. In Mr. del Toro’s update, such a creature is brought to Baltimore in the early 1960s and kept in a tank at a government research lab, where he is subjected to brutal torture in the name of science and national security.VideoGuillermo del Toro narrates a sequence from his film featuring Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones. The film received 13 Oscar nominations, including best picture.Published OnFeb. 1, 2018CreditCreditFox Searchlight“The Asset,” as his minders call him, poses no threat to anyone. He is, as wild things tend to be in movies nowadays, an innocent at the mercy of a ruthlessly predatory species, which is to say us. His particular nemesis is Richard Strickland, a government-issue, square-jawed square played with reliable menace by Michael Shannon. Strickland lives in a suburban split-level with his wife and two kids, drives a Cadillac, reads “The Power of Positive Thinking” and is into mechanical missionary sex (and workplace sexual harassment). His favorite accessory is an electric cattle prod, a detail that links him to the Southern sheriffs occasionally shown terrorizing civil rights demonstrators on television.[ Here are seven films to stream if you loved “The Shape of Water.” | Read some great articles and essays about “The Shape of Water.” ]A caricature? Maybe. But also a perfectly plausible villain, and in his diabolical all-American normalcy a necessary foil for the film’s loose rebel coalition, a band of misfits who come to the Asset’s defense. The most important of these is Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a member of the laboratory’s nighttime cleaning staff, who plays jazz records for the piscine captive, feeds him hard-boiled eggs and before long falls in love with him.You may marvel at just how far Mr. del Toro takes this interspecies romance — all the way, basically — and also at how natural, how un-creepy, how pure and right he makes it seem. And why not? Folklore is full of frog princes, beauties and beasts. Classical mythology has its satyrs and centaurs, its shape-shifting gods and metamorphosing nymphs, whose commingling and canoodling is part of the human heritage.Elisa’s interest is stirred less by curiosity than by recognition. Because of her muteness, she is looked at by others — and sometimes regards herself — as “incomplete,” something less than fully human. Her two best friends are Zelda (Octavia Spencer), an African-American woman who works with her, and Giles (Richard Jenkins), a gay man who lives next door. The understated, intuitive sympathy among these outcasts gives this fable some political bite.Bigotry and meanness flow through every moment like an underground stream, but kindness is always possible, and so is beauty. “The Shape of Water” is made of vivid colors and deep shadows; it’s as gaudy as a musical (and briefly turns into one), bright as a cartoon and murky as a film noir. (The cinematographer is Dan Laustsen. The score is by Alexandre Desplat.) Its busy plot moves swiftly — the presence of Russian spies never hurts, especially when one is played by Michael Stuhlbarg — except when Mr. del Toro lingers over a moment of tenderness, a delicate joke or an eruption of grace.ImageFrom left, Michael Shannon, Ms. Hawkins and Octavia Spencer in “The Shape of Water.”CreditKerry Hayes/20th Century FoxMs. Hawkins and Doug Jones, soulful and gorgeous beneath his shimmering carapace of blue-green scales, supply most of those. Since neither Elisa nor the Asset possesses the power of speech, they communicate through gestures and, since both can hear, through music. Ms. Hawkins, giving a silent performance in a sound film, will perhaps inevitably evoke Charlie Chaplin, and she moves her body and her facial features with Chaplinesque elegance, narrowing the distance between acting and dancing, turning physical comedy into corporeal poetry.Mr. del Toro, though he has dabbled in large-scale, franchise-ready filmmaking, has never succumbed to the authoritarian aesthetic of the Hollywood blockbuster. He is a reflexive democrat whose underdog sympathies haven’t curdled into glum superhero self-pity. The most welcome and notable thing about “The Shape of Water” is its generosity of spirit, which extends beyond the central couple. Zelda and Giles, an artist whose advertising career has been derailed, are not just supporting players. They have miniature movies of their own, as does Mr. Stuhlbarg’s scientist-cum-spook. And so, for that matter, does Strickland, though it isn’t a movie anyone else would want to be in, not least because it feels the closest to reality.In Mr. del Toro’s world, though, reality is the domain of rules and responsibilities, and realism is a crabbed, literal-minded view of things that can be opposed only by the forces of imagination. This will never be a fair or symmetrical fight, and the most important reason to make movies like this one — or, for that matter, to watch them — is to even the odds."

Set in Moscow in the autumn of 2012, the picture sits on the screen with an almost physical weight, its heaviness as much to do with the bleakly beautiful visuals and painstaking pacing as the bitter divorce at its center. Boris and Zhenya (Alexey Rozin and Maryana Spivak) loathe each other, their vitriol pouring over their 12-year-old son (Matvey Novikov) like lava. Sobbing silently out of sight, the boy listens to his parents argue over who will be saddled with the child that neither wants. Then he disappears.ImageMaryana Spivak as Zhenya, the boy’s mother.CreditAnna Matveeva/Sony Pictures ClassicsInitially, no one notices. Distracted by new lovers — and, in Boris’s case, a religious boss who will probably fire him if he learns of the divorce — the couple is slow to contact the police. A lugubrious detective laments official ineptitude in missing-child cases, and a volunteer search group is contacted. The hunt transforms the movie into a wintry document of decline, as the orange-vested team tramps through echoing buildings, a frozen forest and a dank and dripping ruin — spaces at best inhospitable, and at worst deadly, to a distraught boy.Scarcely more welcoming is the dimly lighted, coldly luxurious apartment where Zhenya and her boyfriend sedately fornicate, or the barricaded dwelling of her estranged, viperish mother. A tone of fraught pessimism accumulates, swelling into sociopolitical allegory as, in the background, the country’s deteriorating relationship with Ukraine plays out on the evening news and journalists are vilified for inciting end-of-days hysteria. It’s a grimly cynical view of modern Russia that’s inarguably blunt (especially in an extended shot of Zhenya, running on a treadmill to nowhere, the word “Russia” emblazoned on her sweatsuit) but no less chilling for that.With its fastidious framing and angry-tough temperament, “Loveless” (a title distilled in a single image of a child’s violated, unclaimed corpse) earns its air of careful foreboding. Again and again, Mikhail Krichman’s camera creeps forward as if about to reveal something frightful while we stare, hearts in mouths. The trick is shamelessly manipulative, but it lends the movie an ominousness that’s powerfully magnetic. Boris and Zhenya may have behaved despicably, but their spiritual rot doesn’t exist in a vacuum. When the state loses its humanity, Mr. Zvyagintsev seems to be asking, how long can its citizens hold on to theirs?"

One, Mazdak, who is from Iraq, coaches Khaled (Sherwan Haji) before his asylum hearing. Mazdak (Simon Hussein Al-Bazoon) tells his friend to be cheerful, since the Finns will deport “melancholics.”That’s a deep, subtle joke, one of many in “The Other Side of Hope,” the Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki’s humane and gravely funny new film. The national temperament, at least as Mr. Kaurismaki sketches it, is decidedly saturnine. Smiles are as rare as trips to the gym or the plastic surgeon. Finland is a country of weary, stoical sad sacks, with sagging faces, who sit behind desks, eat bland food and play in rockabilly bands. Maybe Mazdak is right, and the government hopes that admitting upbeat migrants will provide a needed infusion of joy.But Mr. Kaurismaki, a fixture of world cinema, returning to form after a period of relative inactivity — “Other Side” is his first feature since 2011, and only his fourth in this century — is a profoundly patriotic filmmaker. He is less a satirical observer of his nation’s foibles than an excavator of its mopey, mordant, steadfast conscience. Helsinki, as Khaled experiences it, has its dangers. He is menaced by racist skinheads and thwarted by literal-minded bureaucrats. Yet he also encounters the unsentimental, occasionally grudging kindness of ordinary Finns, and when he tells Mazdak that he has fallen in love with his new home, you can understand why.Khaled’s fortunes are entwined with those of Wikstrom, played by Sakari Kuosmanen, a familiar face in the Kaurismaki cosmos. A grumpy businessman whose apparent midlife crisis coincides with Khaled’s arrival, Wikstrom abruptly, but not quickly — Mr. Kaurismaki has a principled aversion to haste — leaves his wife, quits his job, wins a lot of money in a poker game and buys a restaurant called the Golden Pint. He discovers Khaled sleeping near the garbage bins, and the two bloody each other’s noses, commencing a beautiful friendship. Khaled joins the restaurant staff, which includes a dubiously competent chef (Janne Hyytiainen), a bored-looking waitress (Nuppu Koivu) and a spectral maître d’ (Ilkka Koivula).The Golden Pint looks like a terrible place to eat — especially when Wikstrom decides to refashion it as a sushi place — but it is nonetheless a kind of utopian spot, a republic of misfits and oddballs among whom solidarity is automatic. The deadpan style of the acting functions as a vaccine against sentimentality, but there is no doubting the sincerity of this movie’s motives or the effectiveness of its methods.Viewers familiar with Mr. Kaurismaki’s other work (which includes “The Man Without a Past,” “Juha” and “Leningrad Cowboys Go America”) will instantly recognize the hallmarks of his style. Those new to the filmmaker may need a few scenes to adjust to the look, feel and rhythm of his world. His approach is old-fashioned. “The Other Side of Hope” has the stately pace and graceful precision of a movie from the 1930s, and democratic, anti-authoritarian politics that also evoke that era. This is less a matter of nostalgia than of aesthetic commitment. You could list filmmakers from the past — Victor Sjostrom, Frank Borzage and Jean Vigo, for example — among Mr. Kaurismaki’s influences, but it would be more accurate to describe them as his contemporaries.In an earlier time, “The Other Side of Hope” might have been cited as an example of realism, by virtue of its subject matter. It addresses an urgent social problem — the European refugee crisis — and sets its story among what used to be called the common people. But Mr. Kaurismaki does not traffic in the harsh, immersive naturalism that has recently flourished on the international festival circuit, and his movies feel more like fables than like bulletins.Which is not to suggest that there is anything naïve or fantastical about this tale of struggle and resilience. On the contrary, it’s at once honest and artful, a touching and clearsighted declaration of faith in people and in movies."

This year, a painting of his sold for $110.5 million. Haring died in 1990 of AIDS; his works regularly sell in the low millions. As for Mr. Hambleton, who for years had cancer that he declined to treat, he died recently, in a cheap residence in Chinatown. According to “Shadowman,” a fascinating, harrowing film about his life, he was still painting until he died.One interviewee posits that death turned out to be a good career move for Basquiat and Haring. Mr. Hambleton, by dint of staying alive, never sold at extravagant prices.The movie, directed by Oren Jacoby, begins with black-and-white, night-shot video of Mr. Hambleton stalking the Lower East Side, paint can and brush in hand, and making instant silhouettes on building walls. These shadow paintings were different from graffiti, he insisted. They created a sensation, and Mr. Hambleton, who had begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, doing sidewalk “murder paintings” in which chalk outlines of bodies were spattered with blood-red paint, got caught up in the underground arts scene’s attendant vices.But he never stopped painting, even making works with his own blood on paper during a heroin-driven period when he was living in a single room with two women. Friends and patrons, most of them interviewed here, interceded. Mr. Hambleton got skin cancer and had scoliosis.In later years, we see him scurrying through his studio’s corridors, practically hunchbacked, a Band-Aid seeming to hold his nose to his face. This intense documentary shows a driven creator walking the walk, so to speak, in the most perverse fashion possible. The story is both repellent and strangely inspiring."

It’s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams, one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco), an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco, Dave’s brother). A would-be auteur, the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item, “The Room,” that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time, its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013, Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book.Based on that tell-all (which Mr. Sestero wrote with Tom Bissell), “The Disaster Artist” recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class, where they’re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from “Waiting for Godot,” one of the movie’s first jokey meta-moments. (“Let us do something, while we have the chance!,” Vladimir exclaims in “Godot,” much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy, by vivid contrast, captivates the agape class — particularly the inhibited Greg — by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed.An odd, inexplicable friendship begins, and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy’s apartment, the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business, though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades, as it does, amid the sunshine and smiles, and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender, Amber (Alison Brie). At last, inspired by Greg, Tommy — who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty — decides to direct and star in his own movie, with Greg as backup. It’s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination.James Franco, who also directed “The Disaster Artist,” swoops through the movie like a star, one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics, Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too, having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau’s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing, Mr. Franco’s performance retains an interior lightness, a playfulness, including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn’t making fun of his character, at least not entirely; rather, he’s put distance into the mix, as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man, a construction.The making of “The Room” gives “The Disaster Artist” its point and much of its broad comedy. Filmmakers love making movies about movies, and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar “Interior. Leather Bar.,” an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of “Cruising.”) Mr. Franco recreates the production of “The Room” — and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness — with an assured, energetic touch, some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen, who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy’s put-upon script supervisor.Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, “The Disaster Artist” is a straighter, more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It’s a divertingly funny movie, but its breeziness can also feel overstated, at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In “The Room,” Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing, with an underlying intensity that can’t be entirely laughed away. (That’s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco’s performance keeps you hooked, in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy’s wardrobe, for one, suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male, a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery.Yet if Mr. Wiseau is a bona fide eccentric, he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy, including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on, Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died, a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco’s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in “The Room.” Dean becomes Greg and Tommy’s inspiration, a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there’s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean’s art, which might have made their failure and “The Disaster Artist” more resonant.Mr. Wiseau has made the most of his 15 minutes, which have already been generously extended by “The Disaster Artist.” His website for “The Room” suggests that he’s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film, sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings), the website also features a line of tie-in products like “Room”-themed watches, backpacks, jackets and men’s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau’s name on the waistband. It’s funny and somewhat depressing, which also pretty much sums up the “The Room,” one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us."

An obsessive peeper who enjoyed decades of onanistic pleasure at his oblivious guests’ expense, Mr. Foos shared his prurient interests and diaries with Mr. Talese, who documented them for The New Yorker in 2016. A poorly reviewed book followed, only to be briefly disavowed by Mr. Talese after The Washington Post unearthed serious discrepancies in Mr. Foos’s recollections.Filled with unasked questions and unverified assertions, “Voyeur” is a sad, strange tale of two men whose similarities of taste and temperament — including extreme ego, unbridled nosiness and a penchant for the lurid — are its real subject. Chronicling the literary debacle and the decades-long relationship that preceded it, the directors Myles Kane and Josh Koury dance from the memorabilia-crammed basement in Mr. Talese’s Manhattan brownstone to the cluttered living-room in a Denver suburb where Mr. Foos holds court.Choosing not to delve too deeply into the mind of either man — or to question Mr. Talese’s journalistic ethics and less-than-scrupulous fact-checking — the directors are content to mostly watch as each vies for control of the movie, and his legacy. It’s an entertainingly desperate joust, playing out beneath defiantly unattractive lighting.“I’m the guy!” Mr. Foos rails, infuriated when media attention over the book focuses on Mr. Talese. And when one of the filmmakers tentatively asks Mr. Foos to explain an inaccuracy in his story, Mr. Talese vociferously objects, deriding the directors as mere “cameramen” and unfit to act as journalists. The humor of these outbursts is not lost on the directors, who add little jabs of their own with repeated shots of Mr. Foos and his wife, Anita, peeking through their window shades in nervous agitation.The second wife to collude with her husband’s clandestine adventures (the first, Donna, even brought him the occasional snack), Ms. Foos remains a placid enigma. Now, her primary purpose seems to be soothing and cajoling the husband who once viewed himself as a superior being. In one especially memorable moment, he threatens a meltdown over book reviews that he feels present him as “nothing but a creep.”“Well,” his wife says, smiling, “you are.”"

It tells the story of a desperately, unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter, whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants, as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife, Soon-Yi, the daughter of his longtime ex, Mia Farrow. I tend to think it’s a bad idea to put a movie on the couch, but what if it climbs on the couch and then starts winking?“Wonder Wheel” returns Mr. Allen to Coney Island, the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer, the narrator of “Annie Hall” who claims to have grown up under the amusement park’s roller coaster. (“I have some trouble between fantasy and reality,” Alvy says.) In “Wonder Wheel,” the sad wife, Ginny (Kate Winslet), lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park’s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean, literalizing already narrow horizons, and casts deep, expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment’s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants.Ginny isn’t all used up, despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot, and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress, and the sweaty, oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It’s no surprise that she’s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk, scrambling for hoi polloi, while back at home she has to juggle her loud, loutish husband, Humpty (Jim Belushi), and her son, Richie (Jack Gore). Like the young Alvy in “Annie Hall,” Richie is a redhead. But while Alvy is depressed about the universe, Richie seems largely troubled by his home life, specifically his demonstrably miserable mother.So, when Mickey (Justin Timberlake, too modern a presence), a lifeguard and self-described romantic, gives Ginny the once over, she gratefully falls into his arms. “Wonder Wheel” more or less becomes Ginny’s story, but she doesn’t get to own it. The movie is narrated by Mickey, who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions, as he likes to remind us, as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while, Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind, at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple), Humpty’s daughter from an earlier marriage. She’s on the run from her gangster husband. “I know where all the bodies are buried,” Carolina says.Somewhat of a cultural magpie, Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces — and at times entire conceits — from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O’Neill, a reference that suggests we’re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen’s often blunt, overwrought dialogue, however, also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (“I coulda been a contender”) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes, you almost expect Mr. Belushi, who’s playing his heart out, to start bellowing about someone named Lefty. Much like its gaudy title attraction, “Wonder Wheel” keeps on turning, even while going nowhere.This is Mr. Allen’s second movie with the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who seems to have enjoyed taking the color wheel and camera out for a spin. He gives the story visual flow, even when the characters are in claustrophobic lockdown. And Mr. Storaro keeps your pupils dancing with the light and dark hues. Some of the establishing shots of Coney Island recall the softer side of Technicolor, whereas the violently saturated scenes suggest the vibrancy of the Blue Rider palette. The more extreme colors — including an unlovely orange light that floods Ginny — pushes the whole thing into expressionism even as the movie fluctuates between kitchen-sink realism and hothouse melodrama.Mr. Allen certainly keeps you busy with all these colors, tones, influences, complications, stereotypes and histrionics, but to little end. As has always been the case with his movies, the actors seem to have delivered the performances they came to the set with, so the strong — in this case, the invaluable Ms. Winslet — are strong while the rest of the cast members do what they can with varying degrees of success. Ginny, who yearns for something better than clam houses and brutality — and who is mercilessly punished for her yearning — could easily have become a monstrous, one-note cliché. But Ms. Winslet fills this shabby character with feverish life. She conveys far more with a single, quietly stunned look than any of Mr. Allen’s speeches or Mr. Storaro’s color changes.At one point, after Ginny has turned into Blanche DuBois, she announces, “When it comes to love we often turn out to be our own worst enemy.” And not for the first time you wonder what Mr. Allen, who has long blurred fact and fiction, thinks he’s doing here. He couldn’t have anticipated that his name would be in the news because of the allegations of sexual abuse upending the entertainment industry. Yet how could we not think of him? In 1993, he was accused of molesting his daughter, Dylan Farrow. He maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted, yet the allegations as well as discomfort about his marriage to Soon-Yi have hovered over him like a malignant cloud. Critics have often uneasily ignored his history, but he himself seems perversely intent on invoking it."

Hiding out, he takes a job alongside a cousin, a farmworker named Hassan (Mahmoud El Bezawi). Hassan’s boss, Mourad (Zaki Faten), a respected landowner, seems decent enough at first: He allows Ali to stay. But he also counts on total subservience.Complicating the claustrophobic arrangement is the fact that Hassan has married Ali’s old flame, Fatma (Nahed El Sebai). She still longs for Ali, a strapping, handsome contrast to her kind but ineffectual husband, while the oblivious Hassan tries to arrange a marriage for his cousin.What follows combines a bit of James M. Cain and a bit of “Macbeth” — and more than a bit of topicality, since the events in the film, though they unfold away from Cairo, overlap with the Tahrir Square demonstrations of 2011. (The revolution weighs heavily on the wealthy Mourad and divides him politically from his children.)But the movie is somewhat labored and repetitive as a piece of screenwriting, spelling out motivations when the power of suggestion might go further, and its purported allegorical dimensions don’t come across clearly. No doubt subtleties have been lost in translation, but the film is best viewed as an overripe, noir-tinged tragedy."

It’s the story of a police officer, Rosa (Liliana Trujillo), who’s struggling with alcoholism and a gambling addiction while living with her daughter and grandson in Lima, Peru. Things are clearly not going well. Rosa falls into drunken stupors almost daily while watching late-night TV. Those hazy moments are among the few times she laughs. One night, after a fight with Rosa, her daughter Sheyla leaves her baby in her mother’s obviously unreliable care.The movie, messily constructed, seems more fascinated with the tragedy of these two women’s parallel struggles than it does with the characters themselves. They become walking metaphors in search of a story arc. Then there’s a deus ex machina that throws into question everything we’ve seen in the movie up to that point. It’s a radically upbeat note that’s too contrived in an otherwise desolate situation.Although “Rosa Chumbe” is Peru’s foreign language film entry for the Oscars this year, the movie doesn’t feel like it warrants that distinction. The women’s missteps seem to come straight out of a cautionary tale. And the movie’s dismal outlook even extends to the dimly-lit cinematography. It doesn’t need a miracle to see the light. It needs a full pardon."

Her bandmate Malik (John David Washington) proves a faithless boyfriend, and Coco doesn’t split from the group, but does distance herself from it. “You want to rap? That’s fine with me,” Coco’s no-nonsense mother advises. “But from now on you’re going to have to do it between classes.”At the small college where Coco studies accounting, she is led by her friend Julie (Hana Mae Lee) to a poetry class headed by the imperious, glamorous Professor Dixon (Jill Scott) and her handsome, young British-accented teaching assistant Derek (Lucien Laviscount). Both insist to Coco that rap and poetry are different things. She defiantly sets to prove them wrong, only to discover that in a way they’re right.The script by Nicole Jefferson Asher toggles between sharp observations about wordcraft and some “Dynasty”- or Tyler Perry-level soap operatics. RZA’s direction lacks visual personality, but he keeps the narrative moving and elicits strong performances from his cast. The rap battle and poetry slams take place in settings that are brightly lit and — a few tetchy spats between rivals romantic and artistic notwithstanding — relaxed. The dangerous, poverty- and drug-plagued Staten Island from which RZA’s own music sprang feels very far away. But the director’s comfortable approach to his material and its milieu seems unforced, and yields a frequently enjoyable movie."

The aesthetic of Mr. Ingels — whose firm, BIG (for Bjarke Ingels Group), has triumphed with designs like that for the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark in Helsingor; the Via 57 West complex in Manhattan; and the in-progress Two World Trade Center — has a youthful, playful audacity (he is only in his 40s). Mr. Schroder’s film seems expressly designed to further burnish Mr. Ingels’s reputation.We meet Mr. Ingels’s parents in Denmark, where the architect recalls his early aspirations as a cartoonist, then watch the Maritime Museum’s unveiling in 2013, and BIG’s opening in Manhattan in 2015. Major New York real estate players testify to his brilliance, and we see the buff Mr. Ingels bicycling around Manhattan wearing sunglasses and headphones. A party for his employees, presented in slow motion, evokes nightclub glamour.Tension is minimal. After Mr. Ingels has received a concussion from a baseball bat (an incident not elaborated upon), he frets about an M.R.I. and the circumstances behind the deaths of the architectural giants Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen. But his fears prove unwarranted. We see little of his personal life besides his spacious loft and, briefly, his doting girlfriend, another architect. Unmentioned is Mr. Schroder’s 2009 documentary about parkour, “My Playground,” in which Mr. Ingels and his structures play a part. Clearly, the architect and the filmmaker are tight, which does not entirely benefit “Big Time.”"

Even by the end, it hasn’t made a good case for its existence. Still, Hope Litoff’s documentary becomes more voyeuristically gripping as it progresses.Ms. Litoff, a film editor, begins by investigating the storage space filled with the belongings of her sister, Ruth, an artist who committed suicide in 2008. Hope wants to find something illuminating, though the prospect that Ruth, who had a long history of mental illness, left some sort of Rosebud is a dubious proposition.Still, “32 Pills” makes clear how Ruth’s personality, coupled with her seemingly endless photographs, writings and drawings, created the temptation. The film explores the notion that the sisters were troubled in different ways. And as the excavation continues, predictably — maybe even subconsciously — Hope’s own health issues resurface.A recovered alcoholic, Hope shoots chilling video-diary footage of her first drink in 16 years. She pops two pills from a table covered with her sister’s leftover prescription medication bottles. “There’s something about the fact that they’re Ruth’s pills that make them feel more special to me,” she says. Her producer, Beth Levison, who is present, expresses alarm about becoming an enabler.The exchange sums up what’s queasily fascinating about “32 Pills.” Without Hope’s relapse, the movie would be too personal: something for family, friends and a therapist. But the more Hope’s own obsession grows, the more involving the movie gets, even as it raises ethical questions about its making — and about those who continue to watch."

Ms. Di Giusto takes considerable liberties with the facts of Fuller’s life, giving her an entirely fictional male patron whose decadent ether addiction is out of a bad “Dorian Gray” parody. (It’s not much of a role, and Gaspard Ulliel, who was very good in 2014’s “Saint Laurent,” makes very little of it.) In Ms. Di Giusto’s vision, Fuller is outshined by Isadora Duncan, portrayed by Lily-Rose Depp as a shallow arriviste. Ms. Depp’s flat line readings are, in this respect, appropriate.Rather than depicting the milieu in which Fuller thrived, Ms. Di Giusto mainly confines the action to a villa where Fuller endures sickness and a series of self-fulfilling romantic humiliations. She then watches as Duncan goes on to eclipse her. In commemorating the work of a female artist by largely refracting it through an imagined professional rivalry with another female artist, “The Dancer” seems genuinely hostile to its subject, whose real-life accomplishments deserve better."

Stopping him raises thorny questions involving the First and Second Amendments, and introduces broad arguments over liberty and innovation.Interviews with Mr. Wilson show him to be both astute and confounding, sometimes sounding like a cautious bookworm, other times like an undergrad drunk on Ayn Rand novels; he disdains corporate influence in politics, yet admires the alt-right movement.Mr. Wilson’s interests don’t end with guns. He has since joined with Amir Taaki, an anarchist from England, to create Dark Wallet, an internet application that allows for clandestine financial transactions using bitcoin. Like Mr. Wilson, Mr. Taaki has brazen ideas about revolution.Those ideas have been around for centuries. But technologies can now turn them into something frightening. Though it would have been valuable to see Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taaki challenged on their opinions, Adam Bhala Lough, the director, allows the men to make uncontested cases for their extremist and sometimes militant stances. Interviews with Julian Assange and mentions of George Orwell are sprinkled throughout, sowing a sense of paranoia.It’s possible to fully, and vehemently, disagree with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Taaki yet still see their points.

As a British intelligence officer during World War II, Mr. Lewis was stationed in Naples after the Allied Forces’ invasion of nearby Salerno in September 1943. An able translator, he helped the military communicate with the civilian population.On the evidence of the film, he also served as a remarkable chronicler of life in the occupied city. His plain-spoken yet poetic sentences (“Now the statues are disappearing from the public squares, and one cemetery has lost most of its tombstones”) are read in voice-over by Benedict Cumberbatch, and the fluid editing skillfully illustrates his words with disparate material — a mix that includes archival footage and movies like Roberto Rossellini’s “Paisan,” Mike Nichols’s “Catch-22” and Liliana Cavani’s “The Skin.”This aesthetic choice — along with useless snippets of an actor, not clearly identified as such, playing Mr. Lewis as an old man returning to the city — doesn’t always seem fitting. You may at times wonder if Mr. Lewis, who died in 2003, would have chosen some of these clips. But the selection does lend an effective visual dimension to Mr. Lewis’s tales of wartime strife in the city. We hear of a lack of food and clean water; how Neapolitans resorted to prostitution and to buying goods on the black market; and how disease ran rampant through the city, taking it back to an almost medieval state. Mr. Lewis remembers the devastation of delayed-action explosive devices left by the Germans and the “slag heap” from the eruption of Vesuvius, just southeast of Naples, in March 1944.It’s also a story of camaraderie; among Mr. Lewis’s Neapolitan friends was a man who made money posing as a fancy uncle from Rome at funerals. But colorful details like that don’t change the sense that “Naples ’44” is essentially an abridged version of a much more detailed work. It seems less a full-fledged movie than a trailer for a book."

The new documentary “Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story” shows how hard and how long she struggled to escape it — including through her invention in the 1940s of a groundbreaking communication system that underlies modern encryption.The story of that invention has been told before though it’s curiously missing from Lamarr’s contribution to a dubious 1966 memoir, “Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,” which, bizarrely, includes an introduction by a shrink. (She unsuccessfully tried to stop its publication.) The title refers to the 1933 film that set her on the path toward scandal and stardom. Directed by Gustav Machaty, “Ecstasy” involves a young woman’s sexual desire and disappointment, and remains best known for the sight of its teenage Viennese star — then called Hedy Kiesler — frolicking naked and, more notoriously, feigning orgasm. (Machaty apparently jabbed her with a pin to achieve the desired writhing.)By 1938, Hedy Kiesler had been renamed Hedy Lamarr, and she was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and starring alongside Charles Boyer in the romantic thriller “Algiers.” It was Boyer’s show; Lamarr was a side dish. In his review of the film, the critic Otis Ferguson all but shrugged her off as “the girl,” while movie magazine writers slobbered over her looks. “No more beautiful woman,” one columnist gushed, “has ever stormed the doors of moviedom than Hedy, grey-eyed, raven-haired Viennese known as the ‘Ecstasy Girl.’” Four years later, Lamarr was still battling such typecasting blather, despite having patented a secret communications system called frequency hopping.Directed by Alexandra Dean, “Bombshell” is a very enjoyable addition to what has become a minor Hedy Lamarr industry that includes documentaries, books and stage productions. Like some of these other accounts, this documentary traces the arcs of Lamarr’s personal and professional lives, which by turns harmoniously converged and wildly veered in opposite directions. Whatever happened, it was rarely dull. The daughter of assimilated Jews, she married a munitions magnate who came with a castle and did business with Mussolini. When she decided to ditch her husband, she staged (or so she claimed) an escape that turned her into the heroine of her own thrilling adventure.Lamarr’s subsequent tenure in Hollywood comes across as tame by comparison. There were tasty and dreary roles, missed opportunities and heartbreak. She married again (and then four more times) and raised a few children, one of whom she treated unspeakably. She also tinkered and she invented. At home, Lamarr had what her biographer Richard Rhodes, one of the movie’s on-camera experts, describes as an inventing table. Howard Hughes gave her a small version of this setup, Mr. Rhodes explains, that was kept in the trailer she used while shooting films. Hughes also lent her a few of his chemists for one of her projects; for her part, Lamarr counseled him on a plane design.Ms. Dean relates Lamarr’s ventures, those onscreen and off, with savvy and narrative snap, fluidly marshaling a mix of original interviews and archival material that includes film clips, home movies and other footage. Ms. Dean’s most valuable resource, though, are Lamarr’s taped interviews with Fleming Meeks, a journalist. In a 1990 Forbes article, he helped refurbish her legend by recounting how some 50 years earlier Lamarr — who wanted to contribute to the war effort — created a communication system with her friend, the composer George Antheil. What she was after was a radio-controlled torpedo that couldn’t be jammed. Her solution: randomly switched frequencies.By the time Mr. Meeks wrote about Lamarr, she was in her 70s and no longer of use to Hollywood. That part of her story is bleakly familiar; it’s a sad, maddening movie-industry refrain, especially for older actresses. Another hurdle, as “Bombshell” makes clear, is that a female performer who subverted expectations — who was smart and not just lovely — wasn’t welcome in the world. Some of the period coverage of Lamarr’s invention attests to this. “It does seem incredible that anyone as beautiful and as fragile-looking as the luscious Hedy could be mechanically minded,” one 1942 magazine story trumpeted, adding that “she can sing, has a flare for designing and interior decorating.”Over Lamarr’s lifetime, the brilliance of her discovery was overshadowed by the spectacle of failure as her stardom gave way to forgettable roles, misfires, catastrophes and more scandal. “Bombshell” sympathetically tracks her downward spiral without reducing her to the sum of her misfortunes. That’s a relief and seems right given how tough and proud Lamarr can sound in the interviews. Back in 1942, in that breathless story about her invention, Lamarr insisted that she hadn’t changed. “I’ve always been as I am today,” she said. “If I am a ‘new Hedy’ as some say, it is because they are seeing me as I really am, not looking at the outside of me.” History finally figured out that she was right."

Now Ms. Zanuck has made, in her second feature film as director, a documentary on Mr. Clapton’s life that takes into consideration the many turning points in the classic rock legend’s career.As the title, “Eric Clapton: A Life in 12 Bars,” implies, it begins with the blues. In narration, Mr. Clapton talks of being practically mesmerized by music by African-American musicians he heard on the radio as a child. Obsessed, he picked up a guitar and started imitating the players he loved, including B.B. King and Little Walter, whose harmonica sounds he wanted to adapt to guitar. Music helped him cope with, or at least mentally escape, a confusing home life, one in which he initially believed his mother was an older sister.Ms. Zanuck takes an unusual approach to the music documentary. She has no talking-head interviews; the visual component is entirely composed of archival footage, of either the still or moving-picture variety. Interviewees are tagged with onscreen titles. (Roger Waters is erroneously presented as the guitarist for Pink Floyd; he was its bass player.)Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars (2017) | Official Trailer | SHOWTIME DocumentaryCreditCreditVideo by SHOWTIMEThe first half of the movie is largely a 1960s “and then I wrote/played” story that is more interested in Mr. Clapton’s romantic obsession with Pattie Boyd, the then-wife of his then-best-friend George Harrison, than with Mr. Clapton’s seemingly constitutional inability to stick with one band for any length of time — although the two things may not be entirely unrelated, in terms of temperament at least. The pursuit of Ms. Boyd did yield one of the most notable classic rock albums ever, “Layla,” and its making is given a considered treatment here. But Mr. Clapton’s work with the American roots rockers Delaney & Bonnie, and his first solo album, both stage-setters for “Layla,” are completely ignored.The second half of the film, though, shows exemplary frankness in revealing how drugs and alcohol brought out the very worst in Mr. Clapton in the 1970s. His reprehensible racist remarks, his abuse of friends and band mates, and more, is laid out in practically unsparing detail.“I was becoming chauvinistic and fascist, too,” he admits of his behavior. At the end of that tunnel was a sobriety that was, some might say, cruelly tested by the death of Conor. As a musical biography, this comes up short; it plays substantially better as a story of recovery and recovered integrity."

Which begins inside a car, in Havana in 2016, as the death of Fidel Castro is announced on state radio. The streets are nearly empty and have a haunted quality. Havana has seen a lot of change, but in some ways it still earns its reputation for being frozen in time.Mr. Alpert’s movie is a personal examination of the ways Cuba changed and did not change over the course of the 45 years he has been visiting and filming there, shooting over 1,000 hours of footage in the country and even accompanying Castro on one memorable trip to the United States.The director’s story begins with cofounding the Downtown Community Television Center, where he used scrappy video equipment to expose sweatshops and chronicle labor struggles in New York. His interest in Cuba grew out of his activism: “We heard that Fidel Castro was implementing the social programs that we were fighting for here in New York,” Mr. Alpert states plainly.Trailer: ‘Cuba and the Cameraman’CreditCreditVideo by NetflixHe doesn’t explain how he, an American, was able to enter Cuba for his first visits, when he toured schools and hospitals set up by what he calls “the revolution.” Later on, he was on the plane with Castro when he flew to New York to address the United Nations in 1979. In these and other scenes, Castro demonstrates his much bruited charisma, playing to Mr. Alpert’s camera in a slyly ingratiating way.Mr. Alpert’s friendliness toward Castro and many of his policies will no doubt infuriate some viewers (the authoritarian regime’s human rights abuses are not addressed). But even those frustrated by Mr. Alpert’s politics will appreciate the ordinary Cuban lives he captured on his visits.Among them is a little girl who Mr. Alpert tracks down decades after first photographing her, discovering a single mother of two trying to leave the island. Once she does, Mr. Alpert follows the children she left behind. There’s also Luis, an amiable slum resident who Mr. Alpert misses on one visit because he’s doing prison time for working the black market — an activity he cheerfully returns to on his release. Most memorable are Angel, Gregorio and Cristobal, three farming brothers who are able to beat Mr. Alpert at arm wrestling well into old age.In part because of its political blind spots, “Cuba and the Cameraman” is captivating. (Whatever you think of Mr. Alpert’s perspective, it’s interesting.) But it’s mostly worth watching because of human stories like these."

Identified by their first names, they tell their stories to the camera: We hear how they came to Turin, how they became homeless, what they dream of and how they feel about “al di qua” — a phrase translated in the subtitles as “life/here” that, in this context, seems understood more simply as “life as they see it.”In between interviews, “Al Di Qua,” written and directed by Corrado Franco, offers a narrative line of sorts, as the cast members gather at a hospital to pay tribute to Rodolfo, a dead comrade. In the strangest of many strange aesthetic decisions, the voices have been slowed down to give the dialogue a baritone sound, as if a combination of (mostly) black-and-white shooting, a fragmented structure, sporadic slow motion, quotations from Rainer Maria Rilke, Godardian title cards and absurdly gratuitous overlays of Bach weren’t portentous enough.The film’s official materials cite Vittorio De Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini as inspirations. “Al Di Qua” has other antecedents, too, from Lionel Rogosin’s “On the Bowery” (1957) to the Fontainhas films of Pedro Costa — all movies about poverty that combine fiction and documentary elements.But Mr. Rogosin was a gifted filmmaker, as is Mr. Costa. “Al Di Qua” is so showy in its stylistic choices and glacial in its pace — it’s tempting to applaud every time the camera finally rounds a corner — that it comes across as amateurish. The film seems pitched at an audience that has never heard of homelessness: Every shot is composed to evoke acknowledgment of the subjects’ dignity, even while individual personalities are subsumed into the blur of Mr. Franco’s operatic ambitions. However worthy or political its intent, “Al Di Qua” is too overwrought to seem anything but trivializing."

His best-known titles, “I Am Love” and “A Bigger Splash,” feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives, but what’s most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino’s work, passion and drama are expressed in words, deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant, visceral textures that envelop his characters — the cool marble, succulent fruit, shadow and light, sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch, inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies.Mr. Guadagnino’s latest, “Call Me by Your Name,” is another ravishment of the senses, though this time there’s a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by André Aciman on which it’s based, the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian, and Oliver (Armie Hammer), an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father, a professor of Greco-Roman culture, invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it’s Oliver who moves in.VideoLuca Guadagnino narrates a sequence from his film featuring Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet.Published OnNov. 22, 2017CreditCreditSony Pictures ClassicsElio and Oliver’s affair begins slowly with each circling the other at a distance, conveying the kind of nonchalance that’s a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio’s furtive, ducking glances, by contrast, tend to linger, hovering in the air like questions. He’s increasingly curious about this new guest, but soon inexplicably (to Elio, at least) irked by him as well, leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver’s standard signoff (“later”). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook, chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver, it’s as if he were writing an apologetic love letter.Mr. Guadagnino is very good at catching the indolent drift of long summer days, with their sleepiness and bared limbs. Everyone seems to move in slow motion at the villa, except perhaps the family’s hard-working maid. This languor fits the tempo of Elio and Oliver’s relationship, which evolves over meals, drowsy idylls, a little work and a spontaneous piano recital that becomes an overture to seduction. A gifted musician, Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English), talent that makes him seem at one with the villa’s miles of bookshelves, its velvet sofas, scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques.ImageA spontaneous piano recital: Mr. Hammer, left, and Mr. Chalamet.CreditSony Pictures ClassicsIt’s an alluring milieu — charming, civilized and perfectly, if a shade too flawlessly, arranged. Here, even a busy breakfast table and the fruit on a tree can seem art directed. Mr. Guadagnino almost can’t help making everything look intoxicating, yet he also makes you believe in this family’s reality. The grand piano isn’t for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure, much less listen to classical music.) “Call Me by Your Name” is set in 1983, so no one is staring into a smartphone. And the time frame means that AIDS doesn’t figure in the story, though there’s a suggestion that the closet does.The story primarily unfolds through Elio’s point of view. The restless camera tags alongside him, showing you what he sees, his erotic reveries and yearning. And it’s Elio who initiates the affair, at least overtly, though Oliver later admits to playing his part in what the story frames as a mutual seduction. Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver’s ages, which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater, messier effect. Instead, Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty, as when Elio’s father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the “ageless ambiguity” of some male statues (“as if they’re daring you to desire them”).L.G.B.T.Q.

See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.Nov. 20, 2017Written by James Ivory (the director of films like “Maurice”), “Call Me by Your Name” progresses through evasions and encounters, with Elio advancing, Oliver receding and their circling narrowing. The two don’t (can’t, won’t) always say what they mean. So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world, making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting, in the green enveloping the villa, the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg, cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt, Mr. Guadagnino’s lyricism slides into comedy; it’s hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be.Even so, the lyricism seduces as does fragile, ecstatic Elio. “Call Me by Your Name” is less a coming-of-age story, a tale of innocence and loss, than one about coming into sensibility. In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn’t necessarily establish sexual identity. It’s important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women, though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel), while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness, but these affairs further complicate the movie’s vision of pleasure’s fluidity.There are moments when Mr. Guadagnino’s visual choices seem unintentionally in competition with the quieter, intricate emotions that his actors put across so movingly. He can be discreet to the point of coyness (bodies sweat but don’t necessarily grunt), but it is finally the insistent delicacy and depth of emotion that makes these characters so heart-skippingly tender. The charismatic Mr. Chalamet, Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg — whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and, crucially, the movie’s lustrous patina — transform beauty into feeling. In one alive, vulnerable and life-altering summer, Elio’s desire finds its purpose. He loves, and in loving, he becomes."

Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister best known (then and still) for his policy of appeasing Hitler, was replaced by Winston Churchill, whose first weeks as head of the government — culminating in the Dunkirk evacuation — are the subject of “Darkest Hour,” Joe Wright’s new film. (The evacuation itself was reconstructed in Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” released in July.)Considered as history, “Darkest Hour,” written by Anthony McCarten (“The Theory of Everything”), offers the public a few new insights and details about the practice of statecraft in a time of crisis. Churchill is disliked by many of his colleagues in the Conservative Party (notably Chamberlain and his vulpine sidekick, Viscount Halifax) and distrusted by King George VI. The political situation is shaky, the military reports dire. The new prime minister, a man of large emotions and larger appetites, who drinks whiskey with breakfast and is rarely without a cigar, is plagued by frustration and doubt as he tries to navigate between two bad options. Will Britain enter into a ruinous war or submit to humiliating and most likely temporary peace on terms dictated by Hitler?VideoJoe Wright narrates a sequence from the film featuring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill.Published OnNov. 30, 2017CreditCreditFocus FeaturesThe contours of this story are reasonably familiar. The outcome even more so. (Just in case, a helpful text before the final credits reminds us that Germany eventually lost the war.) Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters; a source of pithy quotations, some of which he actually said; an example to be cited by political mediocrities in need of an ego boost.And, of course, an irresistible role for actors of every shape and size. (His American counterpart in this regard is not Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill’s partner and peer, but Lyndon B. Johnson, who also possessed impressive jowls and a colorful way with words.) Gary Oldman, aided by diligent makeup artists and propelled by his own unmatched craft and discipline, embraces the task with almost palpable delight. The challenges facing Churchill are of lethal seriousness, but the key to his effectiveness is his capacity for pleasure. He enjoys the push and pull of politics, the intellectual labor of problem-solving and the daily adventure of being himself. In grasping that joy, Mr. Oldman partakes of it and passes it along to the audience. He is having fun, playing the part in every sense. And his blustery, blubbery charm, backed as it is by a sly and acute intelligence, is hard to resist.Apart from Halifax and Chamberlain, desiccated aristo puddings played by Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup, nobody makes much of an effort. Churchill is regarded with frank adoration by the camera and by the people, the women in particular, charged with the tasks of attending and indulging him. Kristin Scott Thomas is his wife, Clementine Churchill, a woman of brisk confidence and ironic disposition who long ago made peace with her secondary place in his public life. Lily James is his secretary, Elizabeth Layton, a clever and wide-eyed English rose who types Churchill’s correspondence and chastely buoys his morale at difficult moments.ImageKristin Scott Thomas and Mr. Oldman in “Darkest Hour.”CreditJack English/Focus FeaturesKing George is played by Ben Mendelsohn as a weary and aloof sovereign — a chillier, sadder fellow than the version incarnated by Colin Firth in “The King’s Speech.” “Darkest Hour,” a companion to “Dunkirk,” is also in several senses a sequel to “The King’s Speech,” a mildly enjoyed best picture winner. It is similarly a movie about the production of an important piece of rhetoric, a “mobilization of the English language” in the service of a vital and righteous cause.And like “The King’s Speech,” Mr. Wright’s film is a serviceable enough historical drama. But like “Dunkirk,” it falls back on an idealized notion of the English character that feels, in present circumstances, less nostalgic than downright reactionary, and as empty as those ubiquitous “Keep Calm and Carry On” internet memes. Rather than invite the audience to think about the difficulties of democratic governance at a time of peril, the filmmakers promote passivity and hero-worship, offering not so much a Great Man Theory as a great man fetish. Their sham populism is most evident in a ridiculous scene in which Churchill rides the London Underground and meets The People, a motley mass of stiff upper lips and brimming eyes.Churchill’s resolve, like the bravery of the soldiers, airmen and ordinary Britons in “Dunkirk,” is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation, but rather as a sop, an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity. Standing up to the Nazis, an undeniably brave and good thing to have done, is treated like a moral check that can be cashed in perpetuity. “Darkest Hour” is proud of its hero, proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact. It wants you to share that pride, and to claim a share of it. But we have nothing to be proud of."

Fireworks have long been a major industry in the municipality. Even children take up the work, which — despite the danger — has an artisanal quality and rich traditions, including the construction of bull-shaped parade floats that explode with light and color when ignited.But the movie, advertised as a “sensory experience,” ultimately treats the sociological context as secondary. Mostly, it’s a vehicle for cinematographic derring-do. Flames and embers surround the gliding camera. In a section that deals with the construction of castles of fire — towers that shoot off fireworks — a local with a GoPro on his head climbs to a terrifying height. Shortly afterward, we see one of the castles struck by lightning. It’s an amazing get.Still, the film, accompanied by a percussive score from Benh Zeitlin and Dan Romer (both wrote the music for “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which Mr. Zeitlin directed), has a wandering attention span and grows monotonous even at barely more than one hour. In brief moments — watching medics treat the wounded or police prepare for the day of the burning of the bulls — “Brimstone & Glory” hints at a more expansive, tapestry-like documentary that might have been. The decision not to dwell on the subjects is especially frustrating considering what happened in Tultepec last December, after filming, when an explosion at Mexico’s largest fireworks emporium killed dozens."

Sometimes you witness a big, bold breakthrough, like the computer-assisted rendering of fur in “Monsters, Inc.,” of water in “Finding Nemo,” or of metal in “Cars.” The innovations in “Coco” are no less satisfying for being of a more subtle kind. The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough, almost tactile quality. Human bones, hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor — when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space — that will warm any film-geek’s heart. Not to mention the Frida Kahlo-inspired musical number with dancing papaya seeds.“Coco” is also one of those Pixar movies that attempt a conceptual breakthrough, an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern, mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. From the very start, the studio has explored the inner lives of inanimate objects like lamps and toys with a tenderness we now take for granted. It has also summoned the post-human future (“Wall-E”) and the human unconscious (“Inside/Out”) with breathtaking ingenuity. And now it has set out to make a family-friendly cartoon about death.Image“Coco” was directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina.CreditDisney PixarDon’t let that scare you or your children away. There is a murder (revealed in the third act) and a fatal church-bell-related accident (witnessed in the first), but the afterlife in “Coco” is a warm and hectic place, more comical than creepy. The story takes place during the Day of the Dead, when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich), the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts.Nearly as enchanting as that magical realm is the Mexican village of Santa Cecilia, Miguel’s hometown, where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of “Coco” is inclusive rather than exoticizing, pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here, the importance of family — the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero — is both specific and universal. It’s what explains the particular beats of Miguel’s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background.He shows a certain kinship with other well-known recent cartoon characters. A gifted musician in a family that forbids music, he is a bit like Remy, the “Ratatouille” rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition, and like Mumble, the misfit penguin in “Happy Feet.” Miguel’s genealogical quest — a search for roots, lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is — resembles Dory’s journey in “Finding Dory.” The sidekicks who accompany him, animal and (formerly) human, are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes, and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before.Pixar Movies to Make You CryGet ready to feel all of the feelings. See all the titles in this collection on Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.Nov. 20, 2017But if “Coco” doesn’t quite reach the highest level of Pixar masterpieces, it plays a time-tested tune with captivating originality and flair, and with roving, playful pop-culture erudition. Miguel’s musical role model — and the source of the family embargo on musical expression — is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death, he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo, or at least their show-business incarnations. (His greatest hits and movie clips form part of the texture of “Coco,” the way the old “Woody’s Roundup” show did in the “Toy Story” movies.)The purer embodiment of that tradition is Héctor (Gael García Bernal), a ragged, forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links Héctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion, betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so, he will understand the thread that links him to both of them, and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line.Coco is the name of Miguel’s great-grandmother, who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother, Imelda (Alanna Noël Ubach), is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave, while Coco’s daughter, Miguel’s Abuelita (Renée Victor), is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat. Their determination to silence Miguel’s guitar arises from heartbreak, and from the instrument’s association with the waywardness of men.“Coco” avoids the darker tones associated with this theme, in the way that old murder ballads are sometimes reconceived as children’s songs. It’s reassuring rather than haunting, which is a shrewd and successful commercial compromise, but a compromise all the same."

True, the movie doesn’t ascribe everything in “A Christmas Carol” to autobiography: Dickens also has conversations with his characters, who, led by Christopher Plummer as Scrooge, appear to him like the Christmas ghosts and help him through his writer’s block. An Irish housemaid (Anna Murphy) also gives him notes.Brightly lit and anchored by Mr. Stevens’s infectious, live-wire performance, the film, directed by Bharat Nalluri (“Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day”), nevertheless proceeds like a television holiday special, designed to distract children while winking at their parents. Interesting historical tidbits — William Makepeace Thackeray (Miles Jupp) appears as a periodic irritant for the protagonist — share screen time with a fair amount of whimsical nonsense that explains away Dickens’s imagination, prose style and gift for names with what Orson Welles called “dollar-book Freud.”"

The cat, also this movie’s title character, has some metaphoric weight, representing the life Emily left behind. She now wonders if she should have.As portrayed by the film’s writer and director, Noël Wells, Emily, while mercurially talented, has little idea where she’s going. Upon her Austin return, she witnesses the rather Williams-Sonoma-inflected life her ex, Eric (Nick Thune), has with a very tidy new partner, Celeste (Britt Lower). This raises a welter of resentment in the far less genteel Emily.A restaurant disaster, during which Emily has a semi-meltdown and spills food all over a borrowed dress, leads her into the view of a waitress, Jen (Daniella Pineda), who’s still pursuing the boho dream in the increasingly bourgeois town. Under Jen’s wing, Emily gets reacquainted with the less proper side of Austin, in which she’s still sometimes at a loss. Potentially topless bathing at the local swimming hole and other challenges lead Emily to some poor decisions (she opts to sleep with a man who’s a little too much like the Los Angeles dirtbags she’s been hooking up with), and some maybe less-poor ones (delivering a few genuine apologies), as she ties up loose ends.Ms. Wells is appealing onscreen and is a smart writer. She gives Emily some good zingers, including a riff about the inherent sexism of the word “quirky” and one-liners like “burritos are just sleeping bags for rice.” The film fits comfortably into the lineage of movies like “Tiny Furniture” and “Obvious Child,” about young women trying to make sense of their lives, although it’s not quite distinctive enough to be considered outstanding in that company. (The repurposing of a gag I first saw in “Meet the Parents,” concerning the contents of an urn, was rather uninspired.)"

It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don’t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner’s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It’s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.The particular corner of the past that Ms. Rees investigates is not entirely unfamiliar. The source of the screenplay for “Mudbound” (which the director wrote with Virgil Williams) is a novel by Hillary Jordan that counts Faulkner and Toni Morrison among its evident literary influences. On film, the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan’s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing, redemptive storytelling — the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked, their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility — but the movie resists this tendency. Its people, members of two families knotted together by fate, hate and economics, are complicated. The wounds are raw.VideoDee Rees narrates a sequence from the film featuring Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke and Jonathan Banks.Published OnNov. 16, 2017CreditCreditNetflixWhat you notice first of all, though, is the land those people inhabit, a sometimes dusty, sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, brings the soil, the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic, elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees’s knack for psychological nuance, an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films, the independent coming-of-age drama “Pariah” and the HBO biopic “Bessie.”“Mudbound” provides her a larger canvas and a sprawling, crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved.ImageBreaking the rules of racial separation: Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund as combat veterans in ""Mudbound.""CreditNetflixThe Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry’s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons’ oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry’s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).Pappy’s snarling, slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature, but “Mudbound” does not pretend that his is the only, or even the most insidious, face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation — a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor, precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry’s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What’s theirs is his.ImageMary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan in “Mudbound.”CreditSteve Dietl/NetflixThe more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan — Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband’s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized — are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.I won’t spell those out. “Mudbound” begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens — a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan’s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine. What happens is less important, finally, than who it is happening to.What stays with you are everyday moments — the wordless communication between Hap and Florence, the aimless soldiers’ talk between Jamie and Ronsel, Laura’s lonely patience, Henry’s simmering insecurity — and the graceful performances that bring them to life. The way those instances of ordinary human tenderness and decency stand out is proof of the film’s achievement, which is to lay bare a world in which cruelty is normal and injustice seems as implacable as the weather."

The giggles start with the playful title: “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.” It’s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic “Man on the Moon.” One of those tidy, fumbled stories of genius, it will be forever supplanted by this movie’s dizzily, fantastically entertaining account of its two strange, twinned and messy geniuses.Kaufman, who died from lung cancer in 1984, was a standup who hit the mainstream playing Latka Gravas, a mechanic of indeterminate national origin, in the sitcom “Taxi.” That show was a critical favorite, if not a ratings behemoth, and it goosed the big-screen careers of some of its players (Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd). Kaufman wasn’t made for movies, but in live shows as well as on “Saturday Night Live” and on talk shows (David Letterman), he continued to test the limits of his singular absurdist comedy by assuming the guise of innocent fools or spectacularly awful louts. Kaufman is still sometimes referred to as a cult comic, a category that skews reductive decades later.“Jim & Andy” revisits Kaufman’s tragically abridged story, largely through Mr. Carrey’s experiences playing him. By the time Mr. Carrey signed on to make “Man on the Moon” (1999), he was a major movie star, having appeared in both commercial hits (“Dumb and Dumber”) and critical successes (“The Truman Show”). Physically, he may have seemed a bit off to play Kaufman (too lanky, too crowned with hair), but he took on the role with painstaking if seemingly typical actorly mimicry. Mr. Carrey found the character in big and little ways: in Kaufman’s many voices, his fixed stare and in the walks, stances and gestures he used to play characters or when he was just being (or playing) Andy.ImageMr. Carrey as Andy Kaufman.CreditFrancois Duhamel/Netflix,VICE Documentary Films“Jim & Andy” suggests that in finding Kaufman, Mr. Carrey also lost himself, at least for a while (though maybe longer). The story of what happened during the making of “Man on the Moon” has been covered before, including in news articles published around the time of its release. In one, a journalist who visited the set during production noted that Mr. Carrey never broke character even after cut was called. In another account, Mr. DeVito, who played George Shapiro, Andy Kaufman’s manager in “Man on the Moon,” said Mr. Carrey dove so deeply into his role as Kaufman that “Jim only came to work two days during the filming.” That sure sounds like the final word on the Carrey-Kaufman cinematic convergence.Directed by Chris Smith, “Jim & Andy” reveals that those earlier reports — which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far — hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). “So, Jim, how would you start this movie?,” an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket, Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then, looking directly into the camera, he says: “Well, if I had my choice, it wouldn’t start at all. It would already have been.” Mr. Carrey breaks into a small, ambiguous smile. “And it wouldn’t end, either.”Is Mr. Carrey smiling at his words or his memories (or at us)? It can be hard to know, an uncertainty that fits the movie’s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast, the documentary’s genesis, which is partly spelled out in title cards, is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of “Man on the Moon.” This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey’s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (“Her”), a producer on “Jim & Andy,” persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith, whose earlier titles include “American Movie” and “The Yes Men,” was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey.The result isn’t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. “Jim & Andy” is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that’s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there’s something from Mr. Carrey’s life (a story about his father, a glimpse of an early routine); in another, something from Kaufman’s personal history (his family, his work, his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side, at other times they overlap. And, every so often, Kaufman’s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge lizard, muscles in to upend the entire thing.“Jim & Andy” folds a lot into its 95 minutes. It slides from art to life — thoughtfully poking around in that blurred space between them — and jumps around in time, all while flipping from Kaufman to Mr. Carrey and then to Mr. Carrey as Mr. Kaufman. (The editor is Barry Poltermann.) You never get lost amid all these multiple identities and realities, which Mr. Smith amusingly, at times alarmingly, gathers together. It’s funny watching Milos Forman — who directed “Man on the Moon” — refer to Mr. Carrey as Andy, but when Mr. Carrey turns into Tony Clifton something more sinister and menacing comes through. Is this art, indulgence or madness? As this documentary reminds you, with hard laughter and startlingly intense emotion, comedy always needs its pound of flesh."

But I think “The Breadwinner” is worth celebrating, in part because it is a work that in some ways qualifies as reportage.Deborah Ellis, the Canadian author on whose children’s novel this movie is based, traveled in the late ’90s to Pakistan, where she interviewed Afghan refugees fleeing war and Taliban rule. The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana, a young girl we first see in this movie with her father, an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana’s father is arrested without charges.Forbidden by roaming Taliban from so much as walking outside by herself, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother, older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties, she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style, it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king.Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director, Nora Twomey, has a nuanced way with characterization and action, and the voice cast, led by Saara Chaudry of “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” is terrific. In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality. Rather, it demonstrates that the way imagination refracts reality can provide not only solace but also real-world strategy."

When the helmet is removed, we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred, his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped, giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression.The good-natured fellow describes his facial birth defects, and the 27 operations he’s endured to deal with them, as “hilarious.” But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade, and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother, Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts).The Pullmans are an upper-middle-class family living in a fairy-tale New York, one that the film’s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster, British Columbia, where the interior of the family’s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie, whose father, Nate (Owen Wilson), has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers, is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless, he knows that he will encounter bullies, and he does. But Auggie is smart, clever and exceptionally good-hearted (at least when he is not being made to feel self-conscious and alone), and has a knack for winning people over.The movie, based on the popular children’s novel by R.J. Palacio, hews to the book’s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir’s classic “The Rules of the Game” about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir’s movie, that fact is called a “truly terrible thing.” In the world of this film, understanding another person’s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie’s older sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), you learn why, in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend, she impulsively tells him that she’s an only child, despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother.Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, the movie has a cast that’s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie’s parents, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once, and Mr. Wilson explains life’s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble, anchored by Mr. Tremblay’s Auggie, are perfect.“Wonder” is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering. Mr. Chbosky’s 2012 feature, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” split the difference between the sentimental heart-tugging associated with more standard Hollywood fare, and the intelligence and intimacy often associated with independent films. He accomplishes something very similar, and equally worthwhile, here."

The perpetrator, a restive stranger we will come to know as Elwood (played with chilling unpredictability by Christopher Abbott), has dark business with Lila (Imogen Poots), the young wife of one of the victims.Waiting to conclude that transaction, Elwood washes up in a motel owned by Sam (Jon Bernthal), a onetime rodeo star limping after too many falls and trembling with the early signs of Parkinson’s disease. Gentle and melancholy, Sam mutes his demons with routine and a long-term affair with a married neighbor (Rosemarie DeWitt, fabulous). And then Elwood invites him to dinner.Set in a remote Alaskan valley (softly photographed in British Columbia by the cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné), “Sweet Virginia” is a quiet knife-twister in which atmosphere and performance are everything. The story (by the twin brothers Benjamin and Paul China) is flimsy and the characters have just enough heft to keep the gears of the plot clicking. Accumulating suspense from the inevitability of a final showdown, the director, Jamie M. Dagg, uses long takes and uncluttered setups that leave his actors room to flex.And they do, especially Mr. Bernthal, who gives Sam an aw-shucks friendliness that belies the strength behind his wounded body language. From the moment he and Elwood meet, they’re familiar trains — the lone gunman and the broken-down hero — running on tracks whose intersection is preordained."

When we meet Sonia, her tailor shop is the last remaining business in a deserted mall. She parks her Oldsmobile in a no-parking zone every morning. She loves leopard print, marveling that it never goes out of style.But between shop duties, speaking engagements and gefilte fish preparation, Sonia recounts her memories as a witness to senseless murders, including the death of her own mother in the gas chambers. Sonia neither forgives nor forgets the brutality inflicted upon her during the war, and her recollections are forcefully raw despite the habit she’s made of sharing them. After more than 70 years, she still sleeps with her mother’s scarf inside her pillow.Sonia is a powerful subject, but “Big Sonia” brings little perspective to her story. The film’s directors, Leah Warshawski (Sonia’s granddaughter) and Todd Soliday, find promising observations in interviews with Sonia’s children, who describe as adults what it was like to grow up with traumatized parents. But too often, interviewees appear trapped by their own inarticulacy, lacking interviewers who will push them toward insight. The narrative focus flits, like its subject, from one engagement to the next, never sitting long enough with any scene to encourage much thought about it. For Sonia, restlessness is an essential coping mechanism, a way to keep her mind on the present. For the film, adapting this strategy becomes a way to fill time at the expense of understanding."

SCOTT","Review: ‘On the Beach at Night Alone’ Zooms in on a Love Affair","Kim Min-hee stars in a new film from the prolific South Korean director Hong Sang-soo. The movie has been seen as based partly on their affair.","2017-11-16",NA,"2017-12-01 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/on-the-beach-at-night-alone-review-hong-sang-soo.html,Read the New York Times Review of On the Beach at Night Alone,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/17/arts/17onthebeach/17onthebeach-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"The South Korean filmmaker Hong Sang-soo is both prolific and consistent. His movies tend to feature chronological displacement, romantic disaffection, startling zooms and the consumption of many bottles of soju. “On the Beach at Night Alone,” one of three features directed by Mr. Hong presented at festivals this year, is split into two parts — the first set in Hamburg, Germany, the second in the South Korean seaside city of Gangneung — and includes an extended, awkward, zoom-punctuated scene of drunken recrimination.The focus of that scene, and of every other in the film, is Kim Min-hee, who has worked frequently with Mr. Hong, often playing a young woman involved, at least potentially, with a man who is sometimes a filmmaker. In March, following a great deal of rumor and scandal in the Korean news media, Mr. Hong and Ms. Kim admitted to their own affair, which contributed to the end of Mr. Hong’s marriage. “On the Beach at Night Alone” has been seen as a confession and an explanation of their affair, an act of self-revelation on the part of both the director and the star.Even without that layer of tabloid fascination — which may resonate with recent developments in Hollywood and elsewhere — “On the Beach” feels more raw and personal than some of Mr. Hong’s other work. His explorations of the miscommunications between men and women can turn into meditations, at times acute, at times coy, on the nature of cinema and the reliability of narrative. This film feels less like the playing out of a conceit (in the manner of another 2017 feature “The Day After”) than the attempt to work out a problem.The problem for Young-hee (Ms. Kim) is how to process a painful, ambiguous experience, something that happened in the gap between the film’s sections. In the first, she is in Germany with an older, female friend (Seo Young-hwa), wandering through wintry parks, visiting acquaintances and talking about and around the scandalous love affair back home in Korea. In spite of this companionship, loneliness hovers around Young-hee like the North Sea mist, and she winds up literally fulfilling the film’s title.Back home, her mood is less melancholy and more confrontational. She is sarcastic with old friends and ferocious when drunk, pushing away sympathy with one hand and inviting it with the other. The relationship between the two halves of the film, like every other relationship in it, remains somewhat enigmatic. What the audience experiences as before and after could be two versions of the same story. Or one could be a fantasy contained within the other, though it might be hard to say which is which.But in spite of this indeterminacy, “On the Beach at Night Alone” is not difficult. Its characters are subject to recognizable emotions that they struggle to express clearly and transparently, helped along by a musical soundtrack heavy with Schubert and by the close attention of Mr. Hong’s camera. Ms. Kim is simultaneously an ordinary woman and a melodramatic heroine, her performance made more layered and intriguing by the intimation that she may be playing herself."
"6600","Porto","",0,"JEANNETTE CATSOULIS","Review: In ‘Porto,’ a Night of Bliss and Heartbreak","In one of the last film roles before his death, Anton Yelchin stars in this first narrative feature from Gabe Klinger.","2017-11-16",NA,"2017-12-01 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/porto-review-anton-yelchin.html,Read the New York Times Review of Porto,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/17/arts/17porto/17porto-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"“Porto,” named for the coastal city in Portugal where it takes place, is a wistful mood piece about a one-night stand between mismatched expats, an American man and a Frenchwoman.The movie’s true subject, however, is time: its passage and promise, its weight and disappointments. Looping backward and forward — and using no fewer than three types of film stock — this first narrative feature from Gabe Klinger seduces with breathtakingly gorgeous visuals that feel both achingly nostalgic and elegantly modern.These often ravishing aesthetics and stylistic quirks act as soft restraints, keeping us watching despite a near-total absence of story and a thinly disguised attitude of male entitlement. When Jake (Anton Yelchin) spies Mati (Lucie Lucas) in a late-night cafe, he begins a conversation that ends on a mattress in her apartment. She is a sexually confident student in her 30s with a history of vague mental illness; he is a 26-year-old drifter with no ambition and a bad back.Their sole night together — revisited repeatedly throughout the film in increasing detail — unspools with little preamble and the clichéd shorthand of sexual fantasy. A mesmerizingly beautiful woman offers herself, multiple times, to an intense and needy stranger, who brings her to previously unknown orgasmic heights. (One shot of Ms. Lucas, posing provocatively in lingerie and top hat, directly recalls Lena Olin’s sexually adventurous character in “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.”)So when Jake falls in love (with stalker-like obsession) and Mati moves on, we are primed to view her as flighty and unreliable. Tainted by a script that tells us virtually nothing about her past other than that she was once a little crazy, her later choices seem callous and questionable. Yet, to any sensible woman, Jake is a terrible bet, directionless and shady — we’ve already seen him try to wheedle drinks from strange women — and the movie’s refusal to call him out is irksome.The choice of Mr. Yelchin, however — whose recent death casts a sad shadow over an already melancholy film — goes some way toward making the character more sympathetically tragic than he deserves to be. With his gaunt cheekbones and haunted eyes, the actor adds a yearning quality to Jake’s restless perambulations. Alone on the damply cobbled streets, wrapped in Wyatt Garfield’s sensual cinematography, he seems no more than a scrap of a person, as insubstantial as infatuation itself."

Then there’s the proprietor of a coffee shop who can’t seem to keep his mind on his business, and a server at said coffee shop, who may or may not be the proprietor’s mistress — but who definitely has an amorous interest in the playwright.The setup and characters are a little reminiscent of a film by the Korean anatomist of bad romance Hong Sang-soo. But this isn’t any such thing.“Wet Woman in the Wind,” directed by Akihiko Shiota, is more concerned with sex than sexual neuroses. The movie is one of several recent postmodern reboots of what has been called “roman porno,” a subgenre of erotic cinema that was very popular in Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. These were cheaply made soft-core pictures that could get away with a lot of aesthetic quirkiness, on account of also featuring images of half-naked women like clockwork. Nikkatsu, the studio that pioneered the form, is now commissioning new films as a kind of cheeky self-homage.But let’s make no bones about it: This is a film designed to appeal to straight male prurient interest. Yuki Mamiya, who plays Shiori, the title character, has a smoldering quality that fills the bill. Much less winning is the way the movie treats consent, as in the playwright’s rough “seduction” of a very young fan. Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off — and worse. Perhaps the “roman porno” reboot project should have rebooted its sexual politics before calling “action!”"

So there is a sense in which “Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” a wildly idiosyncratic drama about a wildly idiosyncratic lawyer, deserves not only critical leniency, but also maybe your investment.Yet this film doesn’t do the cause many favors. It certainly doesn’t serve Denzel Washington, in a role unlike any he has played that nevertheless saddles him with a collection of tics meant to compensate for the underrealized complexity of the part. And it offers tonal whiplash for viewers, with several potentially great ideas that don’t settle into a coherent whole. The movie starts in the vein of a ruthlessly intelligent drama like “Michael Clayton” before racing through adversity, running a couple of unearned victory laps and landing just shy of a mawkish Will Smith vehicle like “Seven Pounds.”The film was written and directed by Dan Gilroy, whose “Nightcrawler” centered on Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a monomaniacal cameraman whose lack of a moral compass allowed him to succeed in local television news. Roman Israel (Mr. Washington) is equally single-minded in his pursuits, but otherwise he’s Lou’s opposite: a hapless striver whose compulsions interfere with his ambitions.Roman keeps to his office in a small Los Angeles firm. He is a whiz with briefs and apparently knows the legal code by number, but his partner is always the one who appears in court, having more tolerance for what Roman calls the “butchery” of plea deals and excessive sentences. When the partner has a heart attack, Roman, who can’t run the firm alone or stop himself from talking back to a judge, eventually takes a job with George Pierce (Colin Farrell), a high-flying lawyer who doesn’t necessarily share Roman’s ideals.A veteran social reformer with a dated hairstyle and glasses that only exaggerate his awkwardness, Roman is almost certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. In a performance that’s meant to grate, Mr. Washington highlights the character’s difficulty making eye contact and his habit of laughing and smiling with too much emphasis. As intriguing as it is to watch a movie about someone who is gifted yet hamstrung by his own mind, you do wonder whether — after Roman and Lou — Mr. Gilroy is capable of writing protagonists who aren’t so affectedly at odds with their environments.The fish-out-of-water clash at the firm is absorbing enough, but the movie misfires when it appoints Roman as a sort of an angelic figure (or, as his last name may signal, a prophet). Carmen Ejogo appears as a younger civil rights advocate who, unlike the other activists we meet from her generation, recognizes Roman’s past contributions and explains that she feels privileged to know him. Roman even begins to grow on George, who inexplicably warms to him just as Roman is wreaking havoc at the firm. And when Roman makes not one but two symbolic getaways — one to Santa Monica, one to the desert — “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” seems like a movie that has no idea where it’s heading.While “Nightcrawler” delivered its bludgeoning lecture on TV sensationalism about four decades too late, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” goes oddly easy on the cruel bureaucracy of the legal system. Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not. Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero."

The delay probably explains why the film takes nearly 40 minutes to deliver a glorified walk-on from Melissa McCarthy, who wasn’t nearly as major a star when it was made, or why she and the other well-known actors look about a decade younger.Like the can that got lost in the pantry and is now showing telltales of botulism risk, this misbegotten mockumentary, directed by Guy Shalem and Cathryn Michon (though only Mr. Shalem was credited in 2007), hasn’t been improved by time. The movie tries to do for amateur cooking contests what “Best in Show” did for dog competitions, but the strained folksiness and tired stereotypes couldn’t be further from the snap and wit of prime Christopher Guest.The contestants include Sharon (Ms. Michon) and Pauline (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a pair of sisters from Minnesota. Sharon is engaged to a closeted African-American Lutheran (Gary Anthony Williams) whose mere existence the movie seems to regard as humorous.In a film with no shortage of wacky food names (“that-time-of-the-month crab puffs”) or kitchen disasters, Pauline’s creamed corn for the lactose intolerant is the only recipe that sounds remotely edible. What Ms. McCarthy does with sweet potatoes and way too many marshmallows is more likely to elicit a retch than a laugh — and suggests a culinary correlative to the way “Cook Off!” has been slapped together."
"6640","A Fantastic Woman","R",1,"A.O.

It’s a fantastic movie. Daniela Vega, the star, is fantastic in it. Quote me in the ads, with exclamation points if you must. My work here is done.O.K., not really. “A Fantastic Woman” is at once a straightforward story of self-assertion and defiance and a complex study of the nuances of identity. The complications extend to the title. Marina (Ms. Vega), a waitress and sometime cabaret singer who lives in Santiago, Chile, seems at first to fulfill the romantic fantasies of her lover, Orlando (Francisco Reyes). Later, her daily routines — and Mr. Lelio’s adherence to the conventions of realism — will be disrupted by moments of fantastical spectacle and surreality. And in the course of a series of ordeals that begins with Orlando’s death, many of the people Marina encounters will question whether she’s really a woman at all.Like the heroine of Mr. Lelio’s previous film, “Gloria” (2013), Marina insists on her own dignity — her basic rights to respect, safety and the pursuit of pleasure — in the face of condescension, indifference and contempt. Their situations are not identical: Gloria is a middle-aged, upper-middle-class, divorced mother; Marina is young, transgender and from a modest background. But they both rebel against a stubbornly patriarchal society that pushes them to the margins and expects them to be content with a half-invisible, second-class status.A Fantastic Woman (2017) - Official TrailerCreditCreditVideo by SonyPicturesClassicsAlmost as soon as Marina arrives at the hospital with Orlando — who has suffered an aneurysm in the middle of the night — she is treated less as a person than as a problem. Doctors and security officers use the masculine pronoun to refer to her, and pepper her with prying, suspicious questions. She is visited at work by a detective (Amparo Noguera) whose due diligence slides into harassment and humiliation.Orlando’s former wife (Aline Kuppenheim) and adult son (Nicolás Saavedra) at first regard Marina with icy tolerance. They are still clearly baffled and appalled that Orlando was involved with her, and the film is sympathetic to their anguish and confusion without excusing their hostility. Marina, too, tries to give them room to grieve, but the distraction they demand turns into something else: the denial of her love for Orlando and her right to mourn him. She is barred from his funeral and threatened with eviction from the apartment they shared. Orlando’s son takes the dog. As things get uglier, Marina is increasingly unprotected and alone.It would be absurd to minimize the political impulse and import of “A Fantastic Woman,” or to universalize its specific, precisely observed depiction of injustice. Marina is, to some degree, a representative woman, whose experiences reveal a deeply held prejudice hardly limited to Chile. But Mr. Lelio and Ms. Vega are less invested in her symbolic status than in her living presence. She has a charisma that defies pity and a sense of poise that can be both intimidating and heartbreaking.Psychologically astute and socially aware as the film is, it is also infused with mystery and melodrama, with bright colors and emotional shadows. Almodóvarian and Buñuelian grace notes adorn its matter-of-fact melody, and its surface modesty camouflages an unruly, extravagant spirit. You may not realize until the very end that you have been gazing at the portrait of an artist in the throes of self-creation."

The cinematography isn’t the greatest, and the structure is hit or miss, but so what? In a movie this good natured, the heart is everything.The performances are hilarious, but the dancing is no joke. As Gia Kourlas, a dance critic for The New York Times, points out, it takes exceptionally strong technique to merge classical choreography and comedy. Achieving what James Whiteside, a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater, calls “a balance between high art and clever camp” requires endless rehearsal and often physical therapy. Hoisting a 150-lb. man aloft is not for the weak-kneed.Born from the dust of the Stonewall riots in the 1970s (the name is a homage to the legendary Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo), the company was initially blackballed by financiers and quickly learned to survive on a budget. Leading us lightly through that history, the artistic director and the movie’s unofficial narrator, Tory Dobrin, describes the devastation of AIDS and the relief of creating a space where dancers could forge their own identities. Giving the middle finger to classical ballet was just gravy.Filming for four years, Ms. Hart follows a handful of touching individual stories and takes us on the road (the Trocks, as they are known, are rock stars in Japan), a punishing travel schedule that gobbles up more than two-thirds of the year. Oxygenating almost every scene, though, is the men’s delight in being liberated from the gender restrictions of traditional ballet — a freedom that allows them to create art that’s uniquely their own."

The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he’s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne — played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck — takes the lead on this enterprise. He’s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (“critical damage” reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He’s also pretty much of a yawn.The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman’s (or Bruce’s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She’s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie’s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (“Gone Girl”), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.ImageFrom left, J.K. Simmons, Ms. Gadot, Ray Fisher, Ben Affleck and Ezra Miller.CreditWarner Bros. PicturesAs it is, the little bit of bat brooding in “Justice League” feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the “Dark Knight” or even in the Lego movies. That’s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But “Justice League” is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude.The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story — one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city — while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.“Justice League” settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It’s golly-gee stuff, but it’s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (“Game of Thrones”), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.Cyborg isn’t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who’s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can’t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn’t or can’t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie’s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in “Justice League” lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike “Batman v Superman,” which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (“Justice League” clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that’s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel’s, may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start."

Mr. Heaney was recognized as a master of sean nos (old style) music, a traditional Gaelic variety of a cappella.He was also an enigmatic figure, according to the film’s director Pat Collins, and “Song of Granite” seems to mirror what the character says about singing. As long as it does right by the music — of which there is plenty — everything else can be a fog.Shot in black-and-white, the movie tries to shake off the biopic doldrums, employing a fragmented structure that emphasizes isolated moments instead of a narrative arc. It also includes snippets of the actual Mr. Heaney talking or in performance. But Mr. Collins doesn’t shed light on what makes his subject tick, and the arty shards never cohere.Mr. Collins has cast real singers. Mr. Heaney is played as a boy by the poised Colm Seoighe, then as a haunted, noirish figure by Mr. O Chonfhaola. The character actor Macdara O Fatharta plays him as an older man. The first movement, observing the young Mr. Heaney as he absorbs Irish folk culture in County Galway, is the best and most accessible, before Mr. Heaney goes into moody exile in Britain and New York.Offering scant commentary on the music, “Song of Granite” will appeal more to enthusiasts than to newcomers."

The natural beauty of unruly mountains, endless greenery and coasts outlined by white sand makes the eastern half of Cuba look like a timeless paradise. But what is paradise for some is a political prison for others, and that world is where the movie’s lead characters meet.In the service of the Cuban government in 1983, Santa (Lola Amores), a country laborer and loyal party member, is assigned to keep a gay anti-Communist writer, Andrés (Eduardo Martinez), under house arrest. The two initially distrust each other — Santa eats in the rain rather than share shelter with an enemy of the people, while Andrés is guarded about his police record and the details of his past. Eventually, the two warm to each other and begin sharing their stories.The movie’s central relationship is not romantic, but almost feels as if it were. Santa, who’s straight, takes a liking to Andrés and dresses up to visit him and bring him small gifts. Andrés does not reciprocate, teasing her more like a brother. Mr. Lechuga, who also wrote the screenplay, transforms their time together from a form of punishment into a temporary escape from oppression.The cinematographer Javier Labrador’s hand-held camera focuses on the characters’ smallest gestures as carefully as it captures the rolling land in the background. The effect is as captivating as the odd-couple narrative is engrossing. “Santa & Andrés” begins as a film about separation and pain, but becomes a movie about reconciliation and healing."

Outside, the frantic sound of barking dogs fills her leafy suburb; inside, the ceaseless demands of four children and a callously philandering husband, Bill (Jason Ritter), render her pain invisible.Like the great Mary Chapin Carpenter song “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her,” “Bitch” is about a woman who has reached the end of her leash. A satirical scream of rage against patriarchal prerogatives, this feminist horror-comedy, written and directed by Ms. Palka, has a vicious edge that can stifle your laughter. So when Jill takes to her basement, snarling and covered in her own feces, her belief that she’s the dog her family seems to think she is comes across as more tragic than funny.The title, though, has a dual meaning; and it’s in Bill’s furiously baffled response to his wife’s abandonment of her parental responsibilities that the movie finds its footing and its humor. As she did in her gentler but equally original “Good Dick” in 2008, Ms. Palka carves a black and biting niche between a man and a woman, a space where chaos and psychological unease demand to be reckoned with. Emphasizing this, Morgan Z. Whirledge’s dense and darting score builds an atmosphere of unnerving upheaval — essential to a movie relying on mood rather than special effects.Eventually losing momentum (but not its fealty to Jill’s desperation), “Bitch” leans heavily on Mr. Ritter’s energetic grounding of its bizarre premise. Alternately manic and maddened, Bill is like a red flag to overly smug husbands, wildly warning of the comeuppance to come."

Voiced by the actress Sandra Oh, Rosie is of Chinese and Iranian descent, but she is disconnected from her family history — her mother is dead and her father abandoned the family long ago. Instead, Rosie writes poems in an ode to Paris, her dream city. But when she is invited to present her work at a poetry festival in Shiraz, Iran, she meets poets who expand her ideas about the art form and about herself.Rosie listens as diverse artists share personal experiences and national histories through their poetry. The writing in “Window Horses” is unaffected and lovely, with each poem animated in a different style to reflect the variety of life on display. One man was exiled from China after the protests in Tiananmen Square. Another recites Persian poets from the 13th century. None of these artists romanticize France.Though many of the characters in “Window Horses” share a lively Cubist design, Rosie is the most sparingly-drawn figure onscreen. She is depicted as a stick figure with two small slants for eyes, a rendering that reads as a reclamation of Asian stereotypes by the director Ann Marie Fleming, who is also of Chinese descent. At first, Rosie’s simplicity is jarring. But as the character learns more about her personal and poetic origins, her minimalist frame absorbs the weight of a rich, complex history. That transformation is the great pleasure of watching this small film."

At the start of “Daddy’s Home 2,” the now-buddies have figured out a way to share parenting duties.When their own fathers arrive for Christmas, several barely disguised gags from the first movie repeat. Don (John Lithgow) proves as cringingly lovey-dovey as his son, Brad; Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty’s father, is a crass repository of growls, backslaps and chauvinist remarks. Kurt’s only trait that doesn’t scream “Gibson” is that he is supposed to be a former astronaut.To punch up the families’ winter holiday, Kurt books an impromptu getaway on Airbnb. You might think the late reservation is the setup for a joke, but no, it’s just product placement.

Ms. Cardellini and Alessandra Ambrosio, as Dusty’s new wife, have a score of their own to settle but should count every moment on the sidelines as a mercy.Hollywood may be determined to rehabilitate Mr. Gibson, but it’s no stretch to imagine him as a man who cracks a hooker joke in front of children or lectures his granddaughter about how men hunt and women cook. Now if he and Mr. Lithgow had swapped roles — that would be comedy."

With her soft yielding gaze and shoulders, Thelma (Eili Harboe) looks like a classic innocent, one of those obedient child-women whose desires bring knowledge and grief. Sometimes these child-women rock their worlds; at other times, they burn them down. The puzzle here is whether Thelma is a tragically doomed heroine (like Carrie) or a romantically challenged one (take your pick). Or is she both?“Thelma” draws on the familiar female naïf and works with some largely recognizable narrative ideas, but it’s finally too pleasurably unruly to fit into one box. It’s a coming-of-age story rooted in the tradition of the European art film, but it flirts heavily with the horror genre. It’s also a romance, a psychological thriller, a liberation story and a whodunit (and why). Mostly, and most satisfyingly, it plays with the female Gothic, those unnerving tales — churning with desires and dread, and quivering with anxiety and suspicion — in which women are at once the victims and agents of change.Thelma knows little about her own curious (and curiouser) identity when the movie begins. We know a little more, partly because the movie begins twice, first with a disturbing scene in which a man points a rifle at a girl in a desolate winter tableau. If this girl is our girl the movie isn’t exactly saying. Instead, the story shifts to Oslo, where it settles in for a long while with Thelma, who’s recently started college. She seems a bit down but otherwise appears to be O.K., even if she’s living alone (and out of her suitcase) in one of those spookily anonymous apartment buildings where no one knows your name or cares.The director Joachim Trier, who wrote the script with Eskil Vogt, stacks the decks against Thelma so heavily that it seems almost unfair, a bit mean, or maybe simply calculating. She isn’t just palpably lonely, she’s burdened with stern, religious parents (Henrik Rafaelsen and Ellen Dorrit Petersen), who are just shy of cliché. They don’t seem especially bad. Yet there’s something disquieting about their insistent attention on her, how they check in with Thelma nightly, drilling her — pleasantly yet somehow unctuously — about studies and meals, as if she needed a firm hand or they were doing a prison head count. She goes along, mostly, but Thelma also gently pushes back.And then she pushes harder, which is when the movie gets its party seriously started. The mood and tone dramatically shift, and a murder of crows gathers in the foreboding sky, as if ready to join Hitchcock’s “Birds.” Thelma sees a lovely stranger and falls into a mysterious fit, violently shaking. The stranger turns out to be Anja (Kaya Wilkins), and soon she and Thelma are friends. They grow closer, trading smiles and sharing intimacies and widening Thelma’s horizons. She drinks her first beer (and confesses the sin to her disapproving father) and then one day she and Anja passionately kiss, an erotic shock that upends their world and shifts the movie into a leisurely horror-film meltdown.“Thelma” is somewhat of a departure for Mr. Trier, whose earlier movies include “Reprise” and “Oslo, August 31st,” deeply felt stories that engage with, but remain unburdened by, the legacy of the European art film. (His last movie, “Louder Than Bombs,” is a faltering family melodrama.) The genre elements in “Thelma” make it feel straighter and rather less personal than some of Mr. Trier’s other work, which is perhaps why on occasion the whole thing feels like an intellectual exercise. He is obviously having fun deploying various horror tropes here — with monstrous maternity and snakes that slither into Freudian territory — but it can seem as if he’s still trying out new ideas and looks.Even so, Mr. Trier’s experimenting mostly works, especially when the genre pieces dovetail with his gifts and Thelma’s story. In time, she takes on the mystery of her strange fits and other weird goings-on, a search which Mr. Trier tries to complicate with a little detour about patriarchy and female sexuality that briefly turn an oblique tale into an anxiously explanatory one. It’s unnecessary as are some of the obvious scares. Mr. Trier has a great talent for making loneliness visceral and visible, for showing how pain can make the world disappear. Thelma’s anguish can shatter a wall of glass, but her story is never more frighteningly true than when she’s just another lonely girl in the frame."

Returning home to his hardscrabble Philadelphia neighborhood, Mark works to reconnect with his unconventional mother (Cheri Honkala, an antipoverty advocate and the 2012 Green Party nominee for vice president) and his half brother (Guillermo Santos), a troubled 10-year-old dealing with depression and Asperger’s syndrome.The fictional element, however, is so fuzzily defined that it’s indistinguishable from the movie’s real-life narrative of poverty and addiction, revealed in testimonies whose naked candor doesn’t make them any less painful to listen to. The entire project, in fact, feels like a collection of awkward vérité moments searching for a unifying theme beyond economic stasis and one-day-at-a-time grit.Very occasionally, this haphazard approach yields a stand-alone emotional complexity. A meeting between Mark and his long-estranged father is tentative and touching, and a scene where Cheri — a strong, compelling and complicated woman — recounts her sexual history to Guillermo elicits both admiration and discomfort. Her honesty feels inappropriate for the ears of a preteen; yet it also displays the directness of someone who has long had no use for artifice.Though blessed with Patrice Lucien Cochet’s warm cinematography, “Flesh and Blood” feels too much like an act of therapeutic cleansing to engage much beyond those involved in its making."

What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.ImageA scene from the film in which archaeologists excavate the mass graves of Armenian victims of the genocide.CreditArmenian Genocide Museum Institute/Survival PicturesJoe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of “The Promise,” a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger’s plan is smart as well as symbolic — evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it’s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, “Intent to Destroy” is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. “If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,” one scholar says near the end of the documentary. “History is not in the past.”"

On the evening of June 18, 1994, in a pub in a small village in Northern Ireland, a group of men were watching a World Cup game taking place an ocean away. Two balaclava-wearing men came into the establishment and killed six people.In this film, Claire Rogan, the widow of one of the victims, recalls being told by the authorities that there would be “no stone unturned” in bringing the killers to justice. “I don’t think they ever lifted a stone, never mind turned it,” she says.The killings are still, over two decades later, officially unsolved, though the militant Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the attack. Mr. Gibney’s film reveals significant aspects of the case, many of which were hidden in plain sight and shed light on corrupt practices. The film also shows reasons the case was not pursued aggressively. The Irish Republican Army declared a cease-fire in August 1994, a significant step in putting an end to “the troubles” of Northern Ireland; in some circles, it was thought that an investigation at that time would stir things up too much.What Mr. Gibney uncovers is grave and shocking and could make a viewer concerned for the safety of the filmmaker. But its presentation is flawed. The movie contains ill-advised simulated scenes that recreate the crime and other stylistic touches that struck me as window-dressing."

Yet here he is in “Mayhem,” still happily slaying zombielike antagonists and up to his armpits in gore.He isn’t the only one seeking comfort in the familiar. Jumping on the rage-virus bandwagon popularized by the “[REC]” franchise, among others, Matias Caruso’s script unfolds in a gleaming, high-rise law firm where Derek (Mr. Yeun) is being unjustly fired for his boss’s error. At the same time, we learn that the building is under quarantine because of an inhibition-erasing infection that turns eyeballs red and regular people into sex- and violence-crazed lunatics.As Derek and a disgruntled client (a gung-ho Samara Weaving) fall prey to the virus and join forces to wipe out the firm’s slimy C.E.O. — and anyone who tries to stop them — the director, Joe Lynch, concocts an uneven blend of video game setups and corporate satire. Given that speed and splatter are typically paramount in movies like this, the decision to slow the slaughter every so often to navigate workplace politics feels ill-advised — especially when Derek’s nail gun and selection of lethal office supplies are a long way from exhausted.Coolly photographed by Steve Gainer, “Mayhem” embraces its pulpy title with fighting-and-fornicating glee. Neither innovative nor particularly clever, the movie understands its mission and benefits from Mr. Yeun’s unfailing air of basic decency. Derek might literally be slicing-and-dicing his way to the top, but no one who listens to Dave Matthews Band could truly be evil. Could they?"

He’s recounting a time during the Nazi occupation of Poland in which a group of Jews was waiting, in a designated spot, to be led to a new home. But, the interviewee says, “The ghetto did not materialize.” The Nazi soldiers “took them all and put them on trains: destination unknown.”The destinations turned out to be Treblinka, Auschwitz-Birkenau and other camps. The movie, directed by Claire Ferguson, begins with a survivor, Ed Mosberg, putting on his concentration camp uniform. He is now 92; some of the survivors in the film, 12 in all, are younger because they were only children when taken into captivity.Ms. Ferguson’s film does not seem to have a particular organizing principle at first. These survivors do not necessarily know one another. But their stories, intercut with archival footage over a brisk and frequently harrowing 81 minutes, build to a pitch of horror and sadness that eventually allows for a note or two of hope to sound.One survivor lived because he was protected by a Christian who was imprisoned for political reasons (and ultimately executed). Another tells of a bricklayer who created an effective, albeit cramped, hiding place for his family. “They were angels,” the man says. If not for people like them, “then you would think that there is no humanity at all.”A few subjects came under the protection of the industrialist Oskar Schindler, but not before suffering the sadistic whims of the Krakow-Plaszow commandant, Amon Goeth.

It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter’s murder — one reads “Raped While Dying” — and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn’t seen anyone else’s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She’s staggered, and so are you.The pain of others haunts “Three Billboards,” at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (“The Pillowman”) turned filmmaker (“In Bruges”) who’s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, “Seven Psychopaths,” a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this précis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn’t have much to say in that movie — it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes — but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense.Stream These 10 Great Films Starring Frances McDormandFrances McDormand’s leading turn in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is being praised as one of the finest of her career. But that’s no small claim, considering the variety and power of her filmography thus far.Nov. 14, 2017“Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range.The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in.ImageWoody Harrelson and Ms. McDormand.CreditMerrick Morton/Fox Searchlight PicturesMr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B, or doesn’t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards,” even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked.Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism, she has always come across more like a character actor than a star, even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy, which can be thrilling, particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie, she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw, hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone, as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly, maybe irredeemable, which also makes her joltingly, excitingly human.That same stone face is good for comedy, too, even if Mr. McDonagh’s bids at humor grow progressively less successful. He plays with tones, realisms and ideas in “Three Billboards,” including the sentimentally redeemed white racist, a character that suggests — despite the rage and invective — that Mr. McDonagh holds out hope for humanity after all. The problem is that the idea he hits most insistently is that vengeance is the hurt that never subsides; it’s the hurt that Mildred nurtures and that hardens her and that, over time, becomes so brutally consuming its violence is all but indistinguishable from its cause. Ms. McDormand still breaks your heart, but Mr. McDonagh just wears you out."

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.ImageKenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot and Daisy Ridley as Mary Debenham in “Murder on the Orient Express.”CreditNicola Dove/20th Century FoxMr. Finney’s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character’s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who’s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It’s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that’s sometimes almost entertaining.Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of “big movie” resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as “Lawrence of Arabia,” but Mr. Branagh’s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase. He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel.As in Mr. Lumet’s adaptation, the supporting cast here is full of stars. Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc’s “Friends” character, Joey Tribbiani. It’s as if Joey, that lovable bad actor, is trying to make the most of his first big break in the movies."

And now, somewhere between the two, lies “Hello Again,” Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusa’s 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). What most distinguishes “Hello Again” from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.“Hello Again” largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on. The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret. Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design. But Mr. LaChiusa’s songs largely fail to resonate here. Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes. And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (“Were the World Mine”). The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him."

Barely eking out a living — babysitting two indulged Manhattan brats, and working part-time in a chicken costume to promote a restaurant — Luciana is desperate to pay her rent in Brooklyn. She increasingly despairs of ever finding a path to financial security and personal fulfillment.Her Russian friend Olga (a vivid Natasha Romanova), an ardent believer in the promise of American opportunity, suggests an answer.

What Luciana enters is a nightmare rabbit hole of objectification and physical peril for the amusement of wealthy New Yorkers. And we discover what is to become of the women who appear in the opening sequence.Ms. Asensio paints a Manhattan populated by threatening hoodlums, demanding roommates, indifferent doctors and scheming merchants. Greatly aided by her cinematographer, Noah Greenberg (shooting in Super 16 millimeter), and her sound designer, Jeffery Alan Jones, she uses restless tracking shots, hectic cityscapes, ambient noise and sequences of prolonged stillness to conjure unease and dread.

It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.ImageMr. Harrelson as Johnson.CreditSam Emerson/Electric EntertainmentMr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior."

It does not apply, however, to Satya de la Manitou, the self-described “right-hand man” to the actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper for over 40 years and the onscreen narrator of “Along for the Ride.” His reverence for his friend infuses this documentary, shot in somber, stately black and white (except for color clips).He interviews many of Hopper’s friends and associates, including the art dealer Tony Shafrazi and the actor and filmmaker Dean Stockwell, with whom Hopper so memorably appeared in David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet.”Mr. de la Manitou met Hopper in New Mexico when he was flush with the success of “Easy Rider” (1969) and had persuaded Universal Pictures to fund a metafictional art film called “The Last Movie.” The editing of that movie, in Taos, became the subject of its own documentary, “The American Dreamer” (1971), which seems to depict Mr. Hopper going mad. “The Last Movie,” as hermetically brilliant as it is indulgent, was a huge commercial failure that resulted in Mr. Hopper’s near-exile from Hollywood. Mr. de la Manitou followed.“Along for the Ride,” directed by Nick Ebeling, does not ignore Hopper’s wild side. Mr. de la Manitou tells of Hopper alienating Taos locals and sassing cops in bars as if these were heroic acts. But Hopper here is an artist as tortured as he was torturing, as if the director is trying to redress some imbalance.As moving as Mr. de la Manitou’s testimony sometimes is, this movie too often feels like a credulity-straining attempt at hagiography."

I recall a guy who, on the one hand, had facial hair before anybody else in his class and, on the other, wore a slide rule attached to his belt. I wonder what happened to him.In “My Friend Dahmer,” written and directed by Marc Meyers and adapted from a graphic novel memoir by Derf Backderf, that one kid is, yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, who shortly after completing his studies at an Ohio high school began his career as a sex offender, serial killer and cannibal. In this account, the teenage Dahmer is a withdrawn fellow who dissolves roadkill in acid in a shed behind his house and indulges in attention-getting classroom antics. For these he is adopted, in a sense, by three other nerds. Their mischief-making alternates with sometimes grisly scenes in which Dahmer contends with emerging obsessions. When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul. But in abandoning the subjective perspective of the graphic novel, “My Friend Dahmer” feels a little lacking in purpose."

But despite signs of progress, the film never happened. Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015, along with his wife and daughter, in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself. Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones), the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists.The documentary’s director, Erik Nelson (a producer on “Grizzly Man”), explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was, it eventually seems clear, descending into mental illness. In one scene that captures the apparent duality of Mr. Crowley, the movie features an interview with two entertainment executives who speak enthusiastically about a meeting with him. Mr. Nelson then shows them as they listen to audio recorded beforehand in which Mr. Crowley describes plans to manipulate them.There’s a morbid fascination inherent to documentaries like “A Gray State,” which is engrossing for the reasons it’s also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowley’s, says, it’s a mystery that answers all the major questions except “Why?”"

That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic."

Add the magnificent Christine Baranski to the mix and “A Bad Moms Christmas,” while still a slog of base sight gags and lazy profanity, becomes marginally more bearable.Only marginally, given that this pitiful follow-up to last year’s “Bad Moms” is even less able to distinguish between crass and comedic. (To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, they’re apparently the same thing.) Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece — the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist — infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to “take back Christmas.” This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another. Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahn’s character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity. At the same time, the movie’s presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers’ room.Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, “A Bad Moms Christmas” ends with its own sequel already cued up.“I have heart cancer,” Ms. Hines’s character says at one point in a vain attempt to halt her daughter’s complaints. I think I know exactly what she meant."

Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miike’s 2011 triumph, “13 Assassins,” “Blade” is creatively gory fun. Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the story’s big bad and also its most beautiful. Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing. He doesn’t need to scream or gesticulate; the whole world is his runway."

Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring.Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won’t be soon."

And yet, glimmers of promise abound.Ms. Morgan plays Annette, an unrealized Type A writer living with the milquetoast Elliot (Jorma Taccone), a writer-director on a “Game of Thrones”-like TV show. Their friend Baker (Dree Hemingway), an interior designer who pines for marriage but sleeps with men too quickly, pursues a loveless affair with a married man (Tate Donovan). When Annette and Elliot separate because of Annette’s restlessness, she canoodles with a disheveled dilettante (Robert Schwartzman). As for Baker, her cousin (Kentucker Audley) promises to hook her up with a colleague.In Annette, Ms. Morgan (who wrote the Kristen Wiig vehicle “Girl Most Likely”) gives herself the smart, loquacious and caustic role, while Ms. Hemingway (“Starlet”) plays the needier, less intellectual of the two. Amid peppery dialogue and solid production values, the movie acknowledges show-business absurdities (green-screen emoting, the seeming ubiquity of people hawking their own scripts) with rueful affection. But the film stoops to using a prostitute (Margarita Levieva) — yes, she proves to have a heart of gold — to validate Elliot’s virility.As a screenwriter, Ms. Morgan is nimble with glib conversation, and she is fearless at playing an often unlikable character. But this movie might only narrowly pass the Bechdel test, and mustering sympathy for Annette’s affluent, insular circle is difficult. The plot resolutions ultimately feel pat, and the conflicts, in retrospect, thin. You sense that Ms. Morgan can deliver harder punches. Maybe someday she will."

It begins with passengers boarding the luxury ship in flip-flops and tank tops. A pair in nautical outfits greets old friends with kisses and champagne glasses. The chatter in the promenade grows as small crowds become a large sea of excited smiles.Soon, the camera moves from just gazing at passing strangers to focusing on specific men in the international crowd. There’s a passenger from India on his first gay cruise, a Frenchman with disabilities who’s determined to have a good time, a Polish man searching for a soul mate, a Palestinian who’s moved to Belgium and the hot Austrian photographer everyone poses for. Although we don’t yet know their names, the men start to emerge through their stories.These subjects have been gleaned from a group of largely white Adonises. Mr. Milewski does not directly address race and ethnic background, but clearly has some serious issues in mind. He asks different passengers their thoughts on love, H.I.V. status and the looks-obsessed mainstream gay culture. Although the repeated questions are narratively obtrusive, the men’s voices broaden this experience beyond its escapist trappings.Some of the tougher interviews suggest that Mr. Milewski would like “Dream Boat” to be more substantial, but that impulse is mostly kept at bay in favor of lighter scenes, like high-heel races around the pool, costume ball preparations and all-night dance parties that give way to poolside flirting. The need to capture so many different perspectives dilutes the intensity of some of the men’s feelings of loneliness and fear of rejection."

But that was old news in Mexico, where months earlier a similar showdown had played out.After almost two years, two gay men were finally issued the marriage license they were legally entitled to in Mexicali, the capital of the northern Mexico state of Baja California. “No Dress Code Required” documents the obstacles that couple, Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias Amparo, who goes by Fernando, confronted to reach their goal — and the public support that saw to it they would.As early as 2010, Mexico’s highest court upheld same-sex marriages, yet local compliance varied widely. Citing religious grounds, the Mexicali mayor and Baja California governor made no secret of their opposition. In the film, Victor and Fernando are repeatedly rebuffed; municipal officials challenge their birth certificates, and investigate a claim they are mentally ill. Three wedding dates are scheduled, then postponed. At one, authorities say a bomb threat is closing City Hall.Publicly, the men remain amused; privately, they grow increasingly politicized. Asked if he knew what he was getting into, Victor says, “I didn’t understand. I had to change my attitude so people would respect me.” As they become a media cause célèbre, though, the bureaucrats eventually relent.Cristina Herrera Borquez’s film limits its point of view to Victor and Fernando’s, and doesn’t delve into the opposition or examine the backstage maneuverings. When, as a public demonstration grows, the men are suddenly asked into the mayor’s office, no cameras follow. But they get their license, and “No Dress Code Required” chronicles the grudging advance of cultural change."

At his best — most canonically in the “Before” trilogy but also in films like “Slacker,” “Dazed and Confused” and “Waking Life” — he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.“Last Flag Flying,” Mr. Linklater’s new feature, is a suite for three voices. It’s a lot of other things, too. A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) — his nickname was Doc — served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge — he mordantly calls it a “better career decision” — a fact that connects “Last Flag Flying” to an earlier work, Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater’s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)“Last Flag Flying” is not a literal continuation of “The Last Detail.” The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed. A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam. But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood. The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery.Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies — though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities — to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son’s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men.ImageYul Vazquez, left, and J. Quinton Johnson in Mr. Linklater’s film.CreditWilson Webb/Lionsgate“Last Flag Flying” often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame. Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc, younger than the other two — he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together — is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.The three have a lot to talk about, and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film’s present to its implied past. We don’t see any combat, either in Iraq or Vietnam, which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting — none of which fits in a tidy ideological box — but mostly a lot of bluster, chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time.The time doesn’t always pass easily, though. The film, like the characters, feels like it’s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don’t always connect. Mr. Cranston, leaning into a New York accent, his hands and face perpetually in motion, has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness, and the dissonance between them isn’t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters.But even if “Last Flag Flying” isn’t quite persuasive, it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking, and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society, and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular, sentimental notions of what those things mean, and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy, and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it."

He needs to make a getaway — he’s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements — so identifies himself as the “strongest Avenger.” No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he’d copped to being the “most boring Avenger.”Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor’s former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). “Ragnarok” tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons.VideoThe director Taika Waititi narrates a sequence from his film featuring Chris Hemsworth.Published OnNov. 1, 2017CreditCreditMarvel StudiosThat isn’t Thor’s fault; he was drawn that way. But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary — and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He’s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of “Ragnarok,” he’s a playfully sustained joke.As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople”) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There’s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”ImageCate Blanchett as Hela.CreditMarvel StudiosThe Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi’s handling of the material. It’s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture’s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk’s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in “Ragnarok” than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi’s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery.That scene is a jolt, because it’s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that’s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights, fancy elocution and special effects. It’s amusing how “Ragnarok” humanizes Thor, yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness, the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes, the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it’s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now, though, with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in, what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick."

Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), the principal, has read Lady Bird’s college application essay. “It’s clear how much you love Sacramento,” Sister Sarah remarks. This comes as a surprise, both to Lady Bird and the viewer, who is by now aware of Lady Bird’s frustration with her hometown.“I guess I pay attention,” she says, not wanting to be contrary.“Don’t you think they’re the same thing?” the wise sister asks.The idea that attention is a form of love (and vice versa) is a beautiful insight, and in many ways it’s the key to “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s beautiful, insightful new film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Ms. Gerwig, a Sacramento native and member of her heroine’s generation — the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year — knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelops them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to “Lady Bird” — absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets — you will almost certainly love it. It’s hard not to.Lady Bird herself may be a bit more of a challenge. Played with daunting, dauntless precision by Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today), Lady Bird can give herself and everyone around her a hard time. Not because she is especially reckless or troubled — “Lady Bird” is the farthest thing from a melodrama of youth gone wild — but because she insists on asserting her own individuality, even when she’s not quite sure what that means.She tackles the practical and spiritual project of becoming who she is with the mixture of self-assurance and insecurity common to adolescents of a certain sensitive kind. She is idealistic and hypocritical; self-centered and generous; a rebel and a conformist; an enthusiast and a skeptic. A typical American teenager, but also — and therefore — a unique bundle of contradictory and confusing impulses.“I want you to be the very best version of yourself,” says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).VideoGreta Gerwig narrates a sequence from her film featuring Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf.Published OnNov. 9, 2017CreditCreditMerie Wallace/A24“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.I’ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that’s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, “Lady Bird” is."

Bonnie drinks and dances, swatting away a few overeager hands. After turning down her friend’s offer to split a cab, she stumbles toward home. Bonnie puts on her headphones, she’s in her own world. And then Bonnie is pulled into an alleyway, where she is brutally raped by a stranger.The rape is an early turning point in “The Light Of The Moon” and what follows are the aftereffects of this violation. Charismatically played by Stephanie Beatriz of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Bonnie walks us through the bureaucratic process of victimhood — having a rape kit administered, going to the police station to identify suspects, and meeting with lawyers to discuss the likelihood of arrests. But Bonnie also experiences the emotional consequences of rape. She’s angry at her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David) for changing his behavior as he tries to care for her, but Bonnie changes too. She’s moody, she’s secretive, her work suffers, and she can’t have sex without thinking of the attack.No matter how low Bonnie’s spirits sink, the film’s writer and director, Jessica M. Thompson, holds her star up to the light. With colorful sets and bright cinematography to match its lucid emotional logic, “The Light of the Moon” is a realistic exercise in psychological clarity. For viewers whose experiences mirror Bonnie’s or Matt’s, this therapeutically minded movie might remind them of past anxieties, but as a resource for those looking to understand the process of recovery, it’s hard to imagine a more comprehensive or sympathetic look at the challenge of surviving."

The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper. It’s the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesn’t want any trouble with elections coming up. The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fiancé is still hovering.Ferenc Torok’s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, “1945,” shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon. The visiting men in black hats — a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) — aren’t villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war. They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics. The purpose of their journey is obscure.The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves. “We have to give it all back,” the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the town’s deported Jews. Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt. As the film slowly reveals how the village’s veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.Absorbing and finely wrought, “1945” is not perfect. It oversimplifies Istvan’s motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend. The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruch’s widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context. And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff. The guilt that eats at these characters resists easy closure or absolution."

The documentary “Frank Serpico” fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old. “Serpico,” the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble. The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino D’Ambrosio, the movie lights up. “I told myself I was an actor,” he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests. He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his father’s shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience. Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying. Next time, Frank’s father demanded payment upfront. “The cop never came into the store again,” Mr. Serpico says. “Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.”Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: “The job was not on the level.”The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. D’Ambrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpico’s past who have a similar draw. But the director’s filmmaking instincts are not always salutary. He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds. This affectation grows wearying. The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. D’Ambrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot. He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or “officer in need of assistance,” call went out on his behalf. But there’s no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp. Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didn’t he? Like much else in the movie, it’s frustrating."

The movie opens in a lively bar, full of gyrating, intoxicated folk, whom Félicité and the band entertain all night with infectious songs filled with blue notes. (The music is provided by the well-regarded Kasai Allstars.)The next day, she’s got troubles with her refrigerator and negotiations with a local handyman. Then, some bad news: Her teenage son has been grievously injured in a motorbike accident. He needs an immediate — and immediately paid-for — operation.In an ordinary movie this would set off a race-against-the-clock scenario. But “Félicité,” written and directed by the Franco-Senegalese filmmaker Alain Gomis, is an unconventional treatment of an emergency.At crucial junctures in Félicité’s desperate scramble to raise funds for her son’s medical care, Mr. Gomis, who wrote the screenplay with Olivier Loustau and Delphine Zingg, expands time instead of compressing it. Félicité still has her job to do, after all. This movie aspires to depict real life, not life as cinema is often inclined to idealize it; by the same token, it is hardly a work of naturalism.Mr. Gomis’s cinematic style is spectacularly multifaceted. The camerawork and cutting often have the fleetness of a documentary, but there’s nothing sloppy about them. (The cinematography is by Céline Bozon, the editing by Fabrice Rouaud and the director.)There is one sequence near the middle of the film, in which Félicité, standing against a blue wall, hears more bad news about her son. She collapses, her back sliding down the wall, and the camera, staying near her head, follows her. There’s a palpable immediacy to the scene; it resolves in a close-up of Félicité that is as exquisitely framed as any shot from Carl Dreyer’s “The Passion of Joan of Arc.”Expressive, almost dreamlike dissolves figure in a particularly fraught homecoming scene. There are shots of an orchestra and a choir in Kinshasa rehearsing, and eventually performing, works by Arvo Pärt. There are scenes in which Félicité wanders a night forest alone. None of these tendrils feel affected, though. And Mr. Gomis has a sharp ear for the alarming way in which romantic transactions are negotiated between men and women in this milieu.“Marry me, mama; your life will improve,” the handyman, Tabu (Papi Mpaka), says while working on the refrigerator. No sooner has he gotten that out then he adds, “If you forget me, I’ll strangle your little neck.” They become lovers, and stable ones at that. This is one of the several illuminating and often moving surprises “Félicité” delivers."

His name is Christian, he’s played by the lean and handsome actor Claes Bang, and he’s the chief curator at an important Stockholm museum. Christian has done something that seemed like a good idea at the time, but it made someone else unhappy enough to threaten vengeance, and now Christian is truly sorry. So he does what any decent person would, which is make a video mea culpa on his phone and send it to his victim.VideoRuben Ostlund narrates a sequence from ""The Square"" featuring Terry Notary.Published OnOct. 26, 2017CreditCreditMagnolia PicturesBut it’s not so simple. While Christian is willing to admit fault, he also feels compelled to note that the problem isn’t just a matter of his own thoughtlessness. (I’m refraining from saying what he did, since, like everything else that happens in “The Square,” it’s too surprising to spoil and too weird to explain.) There are social forces and economic structures at work, he says, large historical tendencies that both extend and extenuate his guilt. Immigration. Inequality. Social alienation. Global capitalism. That kind of thing. Christian knows a billionaire — a donor to the museum — who might be able to throw enough money at the problem to solve it. But even then …Is there a saying about fish that live in glass barrels shooting themselves in the foot? Mr. Ostlund, whose film before this one was the squirmy, incisive “Force Majeure,” takes aim at some pretty fat satirical targets — art, taste, sex and money, for starters — and sprays buckshot at the audience as well as in his own face. The bad conscience of the cultural elite is hardly a new concern in European cinema (or American journalism, if we want to go there), and “The Square,” which won the Palme d’Or in May, uses some of the shock-the-bourgeoisie tactic refined, in recent years, by his fellow Cannes laureates Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier.If Mr. Ostlund lacks Mr. Haneke’s rigor and Mr. von Trier’s sadism, he at least has a sense of humor. “The Square,” ragged and headlong, plays like a series of elaborately staged sketch-comedy routines. Or, closer to its own concerns, like an anthology of performance art pieces. Just about everything that happens to Christian has a conceptual dimension, an element of coy self-consciousness, that makes you wonder whether it’s just something that happened or a carefully planned and theorized happening.Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian’s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world? What about Christian’s own daughters? Can any human action or feeling be called natural or real?“The Square” is also the name of a new installation, conceived by an Argentine artist and placed in the plaza in front of Christian’s museum, that declares itself a miniature utopia. Within its boundaries, this patch of sidewalk will be a place where mutual respect and individual responsibility are the rule. The slightly larger, rectangular dimensions of the screen are governed by the exceptions. But both versions of “The Square” practice an aesthetics of shaming, laying bare the hypocrisy, the selfishness and the wishful thinking embedded in the deep structures of 21st-century metropolitan existence.ImageMr. Bang in “The Square.”CreditMagnolia PicturesThat existence is a cornucopia of delights masquerading as miseries, or perhaps vice versa. Christian, magnetic and intelligent, strikes an appealing balance of smugness and sensitivity. He has a very cool job with some very cool perks, and he turns his entitlement into a virtue by ostentatiously caring about the world’s problems and supposing that his behavior is really the expression of that concern. Shots of homeless people, beggars and poor immigrants emphasize his bad faith, but they also replicate it and pass it along to the audience. The joke is on everyone.But it’s not a very fresh joke, even though “The Square” is often quite funny and, once or twice — in particular during an aggressive performance at a black-tie gala dinner — genuinely provocative. The condition it depicts is one that will be familiar to just about anyone who buys a ticket, and its insights might have been generated by a Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism smartphone app. Christian and his tribe are obsessed with political correctness but can’t figure out how to behave decently. They think globally but don’t know how to talk to their neighbors.You could say that Mr. Ostlund’s commitment to illuminate what it mocks from within is a mark of integrity. He doesn’t stoop to facile condemnations of art and its acolytes, and his view of Christian is affectionate as well as punitive. “The Square” is ultimately a long version of Christian’s rambling apology, ostentatiously smart, maybe too much so for its own good, but ultimately complacent, craven and clueless."

This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple’s son, Andy.Still, the families are further aligned when, shortly after the Mayerses move in, two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family, they kill someone, violence that shifts the story’s focus to the Lodges. It’s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney — it’s based on events that took place in Levittown, Pa., in 1957 — but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens’ signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin, the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche.Mr. Clooney gets some things right in “Suburbicon,” including visually and with his two appealing child actors, who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier, he plays with different registers of realism, deepens the shadows and narrows his focus, using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters’ inner lives, and, once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges, he never finds the tone that balances the movie’s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings, however hard-earned, while the Coens — whose presence hovers throughout — are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don’t jibe.The greater, graver flaw, though, the one that empties “Suburbicon” out and turns it into a mannerist exercise, is that the movie reproduces the inequality it’s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It’s clear even from her few scenes, including a showdown with a racist, that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing, despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses — and the images of a black mother, father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little — their terror isn’t about them. It’s about how bad it makes white people look."

Maya, a renowned poet living in isolation, believes her work has begun to decline. Her only concern now is with finding a worthy heir to manage her estate. Women need not apply — Maya wants to play with power and toy with the young male poets who offer themselves as her potential successors.The passions that drive “Maya Dardel,” written and directed by Magdalena Zyzak and Zachary Cotler, are more literary than cinematic. Maya circles her legacy-minded suitors, dropping references to Sylvia Plath and discussing the merits of rhyme schemes and suicide. But for all the linguistic gymnastics, the film is hamstrung by its directors’ lack of visual imagination. Maya challenges her boyish applicants poetically, sexually and finally with offers of intimacy, but the editing all too often settles into a submissive back and forth. During Maya’s tête-à-têtes, we get a glimpse of her home, but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green. What little light makes it through appears weak and suffocated, and though the claustrophobia abates when she walks through the California brambles, even nature isn’t immune to the enervating pallor of Ms. Zyzak and Mr. Cotler’s compositions.The red-blooded vivacity of Ms. Olin’s performance, however, pierces through the muck. She chews feeble lines like meat, spitting out the masticated remains. For all of Maya’s talk of finding the youthful Actaeon to her Artemis, the only time Ms. Olin appears matched is in her brief scenes with her neighbor, Leonora, played by the equally strong Rosanna Arquette."

Kevin Tent, Alexander Payne’s longtime editor, has worked on some of that director’s funniest movies, including “Sideways” and the forthcoming “Downsizing.” Yet Mr. Tent’s directorial debut, “Crash Pad,” indicates this artist has more to learn about his new craft.“Crash Pad” follows a millennial slacker and self-professed romantic, Stensland (Domhnall Gleeson), in the depths of heartbreak after the end of his fling with a married woman, Morgan (Christina Applegate). After binge-watching episodes of “Dawson’s Creek” and trying to blackmail his former flame, Stensland receives an unusual proposal from Morgan’s husband, Grady (Thomas Haden Church from “Sideways”). The two men become roommates in a bid to make Morgan jealous while they mend their bruised feelings with women and cheap tequila.The movie’s premise isn’t as bad as the forced, unnatural dialogue. Even the reliable Ms. Applegate and Mr. Church can’t salvage the screenwriter Jeremy Catalino’s clumsy lines. “Morgan’s faithlessness has emboldened me to take a vacation,” Grady declares when moving into Stensland’s apartment. Saddled with the wordiest scenes in the movie, Mr. Gleeson comes across like a college freshman fumbling through his first Shakespeare play.Stensland and Grady’s romantic plight might have earned more sympathy if their characters weren’t so insufferable. While Mr. Tent’s direction is serviceable, it’s safe. His movie lacks any stylish risks that would make this trio’s bad romance memorable, leaving “Crash Pad” to feel like a warm-up act."

What do you desire?” a young woman named Cathleen is asked as she prepares to take religious vows. Even though the questions are part of a centuries-old ritual, “Novitiate,” written and directed by Maggie Betts, takes their content seriously and understands that they are not synonymous. What Sister Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) and her fellow novices aspire to become does not always align with what they want in their hearts. Though they feel themselves called to a life of sacrifice, seclusion and austerity, that vocation often expresses itself with a passion that can be unsettling. It is not just about loving God, but about being in love with him. Eros and Agape, the worldly and spiritual manifestations of love, are not always easily separated.Cathleen Harris arrives at the Sisters of Blessed Rose monastery in 1964, when she is 17. Even though the Vatican II reforms initiated by Pope John XXIII are bringing radical changes to the Roman Catholic Church, they have yet to reach the quiet hillside where the sisters live, almost entirely cut off from the rest of the world. Cathleen, educated in a Catholic girls’ school in Tennessee, is leaving a family situation sketched in a few baldly over-dramatized scenes. Her tomcatting father (Chris Zylka) comes home drunk and angry and then leaves altogether. Cathleen’s mother, Nora (Julianne Nicholson), an occasional churchgoer, smokes and swears and sleeps around and is utterly mystified by the intensity of her daughter’s faith.“Novitiate” veers between subtlety and its opposite, which is personified mainly by Melissa Leo’s abbess. An autocrat with a sadistic streak, the reverend mother enforces harsh discipline and seems to enjoy humiliating her young charges. She brooks no dissent and finds herself in conflict both with an independent-minded underling (Dianna Agron) and with the modernizing archbishop (Denis O’Hare). Another side of the reverend mother’s personality — an intense religious devotion entwined with a quasi-feminist, anti-authoritarian streak — emerges late in the film, but rather than reveal the character’s complexity it undermines the story’s coherence.ImageMelissa Leo as a reverend mother.CreditMark Levine/Sony Pictures ClassicsThe movie is on surer, more interesting ground when it explores Cathleen’s inner life, her daily routines, and the camaraderie and rivalry that emerge among the novices. Discouraged from forming close friendships that might distract from their primary devotion, the young women, mostly still teenagers, behave in some of the usual ways for girls of their age. They gossip and share confidences and break rules carelessly or brazenly, all the while grappling, as most adolescents do, with deep and murky questions of identity.Their reasons for joining the order are as various as their temperaments. One cites Audrey Hepburn in “The Nun’s Story” as a primary inspiration. “Novitiate” avoids both the laundered piety of that movie and the sensationalism that hovers around the subject of women and religion. At least since the 18th century, the depiction of nuns and convents in literature has often tended toward the Gothic or the pornographic, fed by anticlerical and anti-Catholic ideology as well as by fantasies about female sexuality.There is certainly cruelty in “Novitiate,” and lust as well. In her desk drawer, the reverend mother keeps a small whip made of knotted rope, called “the discipline,” that the sisters may borrow to use on themselves. Cathleen’s spiritual hunger — her need to be loved and worthy of love, her longing for comfort as well as sacrifice — brings its share of anguish, shame and confusion. Ms. Qualley’s performance, and those of some of the supporting cast, notably Morgan Saylor and Rebecca Dayan, convey the difficulties these women face.Ms. Betts refrains from easy, uplifting answers and facile condemnations of organized religion. Aided by Kat Westergaard’s warm, restrained cinematography, she takes the viewer close to an understanding of Cathleen’s evolving sense of her relationship with God."

But its courageous subject makes this documentary’s shortcomings easier to overlook.Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets. Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobi’s orphans. He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools). Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire. Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted. Yet the film’s tone sometimes turns repetitive. In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully. Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics. Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.“Mully” nods toward its subject’s religious faith but refrains from preachiness. Mr. Mully’s actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to. If the film doesn’t always dig deeply into this man’s life, we still see the results of his efforts. Those are enough to admire."

Legally blind since childhood, Gina rarely leaves their home in Bangkok, relying almost entirely on the attentive James. But when a cornea transplant restores vision to one eye, Gina discovers that her life is not quite as she imagined.Nor is she. New erotic interests surface during a trip to Spain, where the hypersexualized marriage of her sister and brother-in-law nudges the film into seamier territory and prompts a change in Gina’s appearance. As James becomes increasingly destabilized by his wife’s transformation, the movie seems keen to linger over what can happen to a relationship when a previously dependent partner gains agency.Instead, we’re hastened toward a nonsensical, almost illegible ending that lays waste to all this careful mood-setting. Ms. Lively is well cast, gracefully patrolling the boundary of her limited range, with Mr. Clarke less steady in the more amorphous role of someone who seems a bit off from the outset. And though the milky visual disruptions that signal Gina’s initially blurry view of the world are overdone, there’s something seductive about her journey that cries out for a filmmaker like Nicolas Roeg. In his hands, the haze of sex and danger that surrounds these two might have been revealed as more than just a tease."

The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post’s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiancée has left him, has been added to the mix.)The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichés) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife’s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo’s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than “American Sniper” (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones). Instead, “Thank You for Your Service” is a macho weepie, whose message — that wars are permanent for those who fight in them — has broad appeal.That Iraq seems unlikely to produce another “The Best Years of Our Lives” has as much to do with changes in Hollywood craft as with the divisiveness of the war. If, like its characters, “Thank You for Your Service” sometimes struggles to balance staying strong with wearing its heart on its sleeve, it makes an emotional plea in a direct, effective way."

Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging ’60s. (To judge from the film’s grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decade’s tie-dyed palette.)The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the town’s women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself. “The more we push, the more the men do what they want,” she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum. Nora’s days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony. If Nora’s name weren’t enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as “my little bird.”But soon Nora is moved to act. Nora’s rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison. Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law. A small act of defiance against the town’s leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them. Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, “The Divine Order” doesn’t exactly break new ground. It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy. The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.Still, “The Divine Order” effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process. Collective silence, whether it’s from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent. That message gives Ms. Volpe’s lark a timely edge."

But hearing inmate after inmate describe an absent or emotionally withholding father as the source of his mental anguish renders it also an inescapable one. Set mainly in a single, stone-walled room in Folsom State Prison in California, this fly-on-the-wall study by Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous follows three variously troubled non-inmates over four days of intense group therapy with a passel of maximum-security convicts.Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness, “The Work” is enlightening yet also punishing. Even more disturbing than one of the crimes described — and the near-constant background howls — is the convicts’ willingness to bare their souls for the nosing-around camera. Some offenders have been attending these sessions (run by an admirable nonprofit dedicated to inmates’ personal growth) for years, and the brothers-in-arms lingo of the 12-step program flows easily. The men’s wrenching revelations and raging breakdowns appear brave and genuine; but how far can we trust behavior that at some point could be factored into parole decisions?For one quiet outside visitor, warily watching these agonized displays, the pressure to follow suit is palpable.“I didn’t come here looking to cry,” he says, “and I don’t want to feel like I’m letting them down if I don’t.” His guardedness is the movie’s most relatable moment."

The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.So it’s disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary “Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,” but it should not be surprising. The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didion’s nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy. Two of Ms. Didion’s most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo.Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold | Official Trailer [HD] | NetflixCreditCreditVideo by NetflixThe exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid. When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didion’s husband, was a “protector,” Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, “And a hothead.”The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne’s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion’s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while I’d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didion’s life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didion’s work may be disappointed. Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesn’t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion’s appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion’s thinking over the years.Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative. As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in “the social contract,” but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider. (Two words that are never uttered in this movie are “feminism” and “feminist.”) Mr. Dunne’s movie gets you thinking about all this with extremely well-chosen archival footage and evocative music choices.The movie’s title, like that of Ms. Didion’s collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” is derived from the W.B. Yeats poem “The Second Coming.” Mr. Dunne’s portrait and tribute to his aunt, now 82, also reminded me of an observation by D.H. Lawrence: “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.” Ms. Didion’s triumph, as a writer and a human being, has been to take the age for what it is, to pinpoint how she saw it, and to stick it out."

Like Johnny (Josh O’Connor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones). For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self. But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie — the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee — doesn’t present Johnny’s sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing. Rather, it’s his imprisonment by a legacy he’s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.Both are about to be loosened. The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnny’s heart and the movie’s tone. Their passion isn’t pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnold’s 2012 dive into “Wuthering Heights,” “God’s Own Country” weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful. Bodily fluids — bestial and human — stain the screen, punctuating a story that’s as much about rediscovering place as finding love. So when Gheorghe looks out at the brooding countryside and murmurs “It’s beautiful here,” we sense that Johnny really doesn’t need persuading."

But of course I don’t have a choice. Mr. Butler’s character, Jake Lawson, has a job to do, and so do I. Jake’s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built, racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until “geostorm.” Mine involves counting the minutes until “Geostorm” is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you’re welcome.Directed by Dean Devlin from a script he wrote with Paul Guyot and discreetly installed in theaters without advance screenings, “Geostorm” uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state, while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake’s younger brother. The siblings have their differences, but they share an unplaceable American accent, an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice, fire, hail or heavy rain.The movie does what it can to replicate those elemental forces. I happened to see it in the 4DX format — a first for me — which combines the thrill of a Mad Tea Party ride with the sensory challenges of a cab ride across the Manhattan Bridge on a rainy night. Your seat rocks and rumbles during chase scenes, lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper, a spray of monsoon mist, a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler’s stubble on your cheek.Not that last thing, actually, but I’m sure they’re working on it. And I look forward to future 4DX adventures, or at least to installing one of those chairs in my office. I wouldn’t say the experience improved “Geostorm,” but it certainly didn’t make it any worse. As for Mr. Butler, he is no more or less credible as a renegade scientific genius than in any other role he’s attempted; consistency is his chief and perhaps his only virtue as an actor. He does his job. I do mine. The world is safe. The weather is fine."

A Madea Halloween” arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished, but it had its moments, largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous, finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens, Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis).“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” which, as usual with Mr. Perry’s pictures, wasn’t screened in advance for critics, frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry), a single dad, and his rebellious teenage daughter, Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don’t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything, Tiffany, now turning 18, is snottier, and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife, played by Taja V. Simpson, who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)Once again Tiffany is determined to attend a frat party. And, yes, it’s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren’t allowed to have a party in the house, so instead they’re having it at Derrick Lake, which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it’s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises.The prospect of Mr. Perry’s rambunctious Madea possibly taking on a Jason Voorhees-type killer has an amusement value that is not even vaguely realized here. This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate, though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat, portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley’s play, are pretty painful. On the other hand, the lighting is so weak, “Boo 2!” is quite often close to unseeable."

The words, and the passionate, uncompromising sentiment behind them, offer an implicit rebuttal to the currently fashionable critique of “identity politics,” a phrase that seeks to trivialize struggles that are, for the people who practice such politics, a matter of life and death.The young French AIDS activists — members of the Paris chapter of Act Up — whose meetings, tactics and love affairs fill the dense, absorbing 140 minutes of “BPM” are outspoken in their advocacy of the marginalized. They confront their adversaries with a litany of stigmatized populations — gays, drug users, prostitutes — whose dignity they are pledged to defend. The group’s language is confrontational and its tactics uncompromising, in ways that anyone aware of Act Up in its fierce heyday will remember. Balloons full of fake blood are hurled at government officials and pharmaceutical executives. Meetings and conferences are disrupted. Demonstrators lie down in the street like corpses.In the long planning sessions that constitute most of the film’s action, the participants are not much nicer to one another. An early scene sets out rules and procedure — finger snaps instead of applause; no debating in the designated smoking area — which are subsequently tested and flouted. Though everyone is committed to the same cause, ferocious quarrels about theoretical and practical issues lead to shouting matches and episodes of lacerating humiliation.The passion in the after-hours classroom where strategy is discussed and actions orchestrated can hardly be contained within its walls. Friendships form and fracture; rivalries percolate. Sex happens, too. In the case of Sean (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) and Nathan (Arnaud Valois), political solidarity, personal sympathy and sexual attraction deepen into love.You could say that their relationship is the film’s main extra-political concern, since Sean and Nathan are the characters whose intimate lives it follows in most detail. But of course the point of “BPM,” and of the movement and moment it reconstructs, is that the personal and political passions can’t be easily disentangled. This is not so much argued as felt. The erotic scenes are dialectical as well as hot; the meetings have a wanton, feverish energy. The air is heady with abstraction and carnality. It’s not a French movie for nothing. (Though it does serve as a fitting fictional companion piece to “How to Survive a Plague,” David France’s magnificent documentary history of Act Up in America.)ImageNahuel Pérez Biscayart in “BPM (Beats Per Minute),” a drama about young French AIDS activists.CreditCeline Nieszawer/The OrchardIn the first decade of this century, Mr. Campillo worked as a screenwriter on three films with Laurent Cantet: “Time Out,” “Heading South” and “The Class.” (He also worked on Mr. Cantet’s latest film, “The Workshop.”) “The Class” in particular, which chronicled the life of a teacher in a working-class French public school (and won a surprising Palme d’Or in Cannes), was exquisitely attuned to the emotional nuances of institutional procedure. It felt like a documentary in its attention to routine and like a melodrama in the way it galvanized currents of feeling.“BPM” takes a similar approach. When the group is together working through the items on its agenda, the camera is more participant than observer, and it turns a gathering of individuals into a complex collective organism. You see how people with different ideas and temperaments — as well as different experiences with the disease that brings them together — coalesce into something with a will of its own, expressive of but distinct from theirs. And you also observe the way members of that composite self regain their particularity, changed by their encounter with one another but still very much themselves.All of this happened a long time ago, of course, but in spite of its historical specificity, “BPM” never feels like a bulletin from the past. Its immediacy comes in part from the brisk naturalism of the performances and the nimbleness and fluidity of the editing. The characters are so vivid, so real, so familiar that it’s impossible to think of their struggles — and in some cases their deaths — as unfolding in anything but the present tense. And even though some of the battles their real-life counterparts fought have been at least partly won, their anger feels urgent and unassuaged. They were fighting for their lives, and also forging a template of resistance."

A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.ImageJulianne Moore and Oakes Fegley in “Wonderstruck.”CreditMary Cybulski/Amazon Studios and Roadside AttractionsBoth Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes’s films — which include “I’m Not There” and “Carol” — is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clichés. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes’s “Far From Heaven,” his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in “Wonderstruck,” a children’s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.“Wonderstruck” takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes’s oscillation between the story’s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gonçalves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That’s particularly true because it’s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben’s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it’s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick’s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest.Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder — represented by the story’s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts — can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes “Wonderstruck” his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling. It’s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves — in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings — so that eventually they can find someone else."

If only Joseph Kosinski’s action-drama “Only the Brave” — based on the exploits of the real-life Granite Mountain Hotshots, a troop of elite firefighters near Prescott, Ariz. — had a less generic title and fewer formulaic beats. But under its slick, schematic surface, this tale of aspiration and redemption at least offers moments of genuine feeling.This is a movie about Southwestern working-class men who drink beer, carry heavy tools, train in quasi-military fashion, banter in a weight room, attend a group family picnic and drive pickup trucks to a soundtrack loaded with AC/DC and ZZ Top. The women in their lives raise children (or train horses) when they’re not scolding their men about neglecting family or the risks of their profession. Amid the familiar milieu, however, there are subtle, inventive touches.The more aspirational narrative concerns Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin, whose craggy face has never better blended with a parched setting). Marsh is determined to whip the Hotshots into an efficient unit, despite challenges from his forthright wife (a vivid Jennifer Connelly, whose impassioned arguments with Mr. Brolin’s character have their own kind of spark). Marsh, a bespectacled Buddhist in recovery from substance abuse, is a fascinating variation on your typical taciturn hero. (As his avuncular mentor, a veteran fire chief, Jeff Bridges embodies a more conventional template.)The redemption concerns a feckless pothead (Miles Teller) whose pregnant girlfriend has left him because of his indigence and dissolution. He must win her back and prove himself a responsible, loving father. The Hotshots help, though he must contend with a ne’er-do-well (Taylor Kitsch) with his own immaturity issues.Mr. Kosinski — and the screenwriters, Ken Nolan (“Black Hawk Down”) and Eric Warren Singer — let the characters grow in complexity before they face their greatest trial. Wisely, they do not overly sentimentalize the conclusion. This may not be a story of triumph, but it’s inspiring nevertheless."

But the remarkable tale it tells — of a family split up and dispersed to different continents, and the detective work required to figure out what had happened — turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities. In this time of mass displacement across the globe, it is a stark reminder of how traumatic the refugee experience often is.At 3, Izak Szewelewicz was sent by his mother, Aida, to Israel from Bergen-Belsen to be raised by foster parents. “It was the best I could do,” she says simply when interviewed. Aida herself immigrated to Canada and would visit Izak on rare occasions. But she never told him that he had a younger brother, or that his father had taken the brother but that she didn’t know where. Izak learned of this when he was 67, in 2013. The Schwarzes, Izak’s nephews, assisted him while filming this unfolding account.With the help of investigators and archives in Europe, Canada and Israel, Izak meets his brother, Shepsel, who is blind and living in Winnipeg. But the teary reunion and Shepsel’s first nervous meeting with Aida are just the start. As Izak and Shepsel try to assemble their family history, questions abound. Friends of Aida recount bits of background she had shared. At 89, though, Aida remains evasive: She doesn’t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she’s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father. The film is called “Aida’s Secrets” for good reason."

This ostensible whodunit involves a serial killer who’s preying on women, leaving behind carefully arranged body parts and a childlike snowman as a kind of elaborate signature. The greater puzzle, though, is how an enterprise studded with so much talent — starting with the director Tomas Alfredson (“Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy”) and including the star Michael Fassbender — has led to such a grim, thrill-free thriller, one without a twitch of real feeling and next to no elementary story sense.Mr. Fassbender plays Harry Hole, a dissipated, alcoholic detective living in Oslo, which presumably means he’s Norwegian even if he (and most everyone else) speaks in English. With his red-rimmed eyes and a cigarette drooping from his lips, Harry comes across as one of those classically shabby gumshoe types, the existential inside-outsider who chafes against the rules even as he saves the day. He has an ex (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and a new colleague (Rebecca Ferguson), and soon he has a mess of trouble that he navigates amid a great deal of snow, byzantine developments, dead-end detours and a grab bag of random characters. (Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones all breeze by.)The problem isn’t the narrative complications, even if the movie soon becomes mired in them. Raymond Chandler tied his novel “The Big Sleep” into so many knots that apparently he couldn’t tell who killed one of its characters. As Leigh Brackett, who helped turn the novel into the 1946 film, said, “When you read it from page to page it moves so beautifully that you don’t care.” The problem, Brackett said, was “if you start tearing it apart to see what makes it tick, it comes unglued.” The trick was to hold on to Chandler’s language and go with his flow, mood and milieu, letting — as the film’s director, Howard Hawks, said later — the characters “handle the plot, rather than let the plot move them.”Certainly “The Snowman” might have been better if someone at some point had learned from Hawks (always a good idea) and let the characters handle the plot. That might have helped, at least a little. The movie is based on a novel by the popular Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo, whose intricately involved, atmospheric tales are far more complex — they have politics, themes and worldviews — than anything in this movie. Shot to shot, Mr. Alfredson and his estimable team give you plenty to look at, including acres of blinding white snow, noirish nights, desaturated pooling red, a sleekly generic Euro-scape and Mr. Fassbender’s expressionless mug. Yet there’s no glue — not a whiff of life or a single substantial, grounding directorial idea — that makes this pottage work scene to scene."

But if you were intrigued, unnerved and tickled by “The Lobster” or by Mr. Lanthimos’s earlier films “Alps” and “Dogtooth” (I was), you might be surprised and a little disappointed to find him traipsing over such familiar territory. His previous work — allegorical, satirical, anti-realist and metapsychological — defies genre labels and can seem scrubbed clean of any trace of influence. “Sacred Deer,” in contrast, rings all kinds of frequently-heard bells.VideoIn this Anatomy of a Scene, Yorgos Lanthimos narrates a sequence from his film featuring Nicole Kidman.Published OnOct. 18, 2017CreditCreditA24The premise might remind you of any version of “Cape Fear” (except maybe the one from “The Simpsons”) or countless horror movies. Mr. Lanthimos’s techniques — a hovering, prying camera, an atmosphere of chilly, cerebral detachment — owe a debt to the films of Michael Haneke, in particular those like “Cache” and “Funny Games” that subject the guilty conscience of the bourgeoisie to painful deep-tissue massage. But Mr. Lanthimos is less interested in moral shock therapy or social criticism than in aesthetic estrangement. “Sacred Deer” feels like a dark, opaque bit of folklore transplanted into an off-kilter modern setting.Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a respected heart surgeon. His wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), is an equally successful eye doctor. They live with their two children — Kim (Raffey Cassidy), a wide-eyed teenage girl, and her younger brother, Bob (Sunny Suljic) — in a big house in an unspecified, apparently American city. (The film was shot in Ireland and Cincinnati.) Steven also has a curious friendship with an odd, earnest young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan). The two of them have lunch and take walks together and exchange gifts, and the opening scenes invite the audience to guess at the nature of their relationship.It’s made clear soon enough. Martin, who seems both a little slow and spookily intuitive, turns out to be the evil force who will torment the Murphys. Some years earlier, Steven had performed an operation on the boy’s father, who subsequently died. In lieu of filing a malpractice claim, Martin has chosen a more archaic — and, in the film’s modern setting, a far scarier and more preposterous — form of score settling. He demands that Steven kill Anna or one of their kids. If he doesn’t, the whole family will sicken and die. Martin describes the process in exacting detail, and then it begins.Is this a curse? A superpower? As in Mr. Lanthimos’s other movies, no explanation is offered. No boundary is marked between the normal and the supernatural. The normal, in this filmmaker’s world, is pretty weird to begin with. All the characters speak in the same droning, matter-of-fact tone until they are provoked to violent rage. They ask puzzling questions and produce overelaborate answers, not so much like machines but like people doing their best to fail a Turing test.Sometimes this is funny, and sometimes effectively scary. The auditory migraine of the sound design and the visual paranoia of the drone-mounted cameras help create an ambience of perpetual panic. You laugh to break the tension, and also you can’t help but intuit a comic intention under the cast’s deadpan. Mr. Farrell, half-hidden behind an absurdly self-important salt-and-pepper beard, extinguishes nearly all of his natural impishness but keeps the tiniest ember burning. Ms. Kidman has a gift for seeming utterly natural in the most artificial of settings, and here, as in “The Beguiled” and “Dogville,” she brings fresh air to the hothouse of a director’s imagination.Mr. Keoghan, recently seen in “Dunkirk,” has the ability to at once solicit and repel sympathy and a face that suggests both absolute innocence and terrible cunning. Martin is an abstraction, the embodiment of an occult principle of cosmic vengeance, and Mr. Keoghan makes him appropriately menacing and also pitiable, since he’s also a grieving, needy child. This incongruity is the key to the movie, but it’s the key to an empty box. You will suffer in vain."

Two high school social media stars and secretly budding serial killers, Sadie and McKayla, are holding a school assembly for one of their victims, a fellow cheerleader who got fresh about McKayla’s choice of sneakers. As their sanctimonious In Memoriam slide show plays, the dates of the fallen cheer captain’s birth and death flash onscreen, bringing a sickly realization more frightening than any kill: These teenagers were all born in the year 2000.“Tragedy Girls” updates the slasher genre by identifying personal branding as the horror that trends with the millennial teen. Played with acidic irony by Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp, Sadie and McKayla exhibit all the textbook signs of narcissism, and their bloodthirstiness is really a thirst for the followers that murder is able to drum up for their online horror brand. After rehearsing for their own killing spree by tracking and kidnapping the town’s local madman, Sadie and McKayla exhibit a talent for terror to match their social media savvy.But although “Tragedy Girls” is up-to-date on tweets and technology, its high school dynamics conform to familiar tropes. Sadie and McKayla are catty, prone to jealousy, and quick to swoon before their male victims. “Tragedy Girls” might add group texts to its instruments of death alongside marauding table saws and falling barbells, but the movie’s gender stereotypes keep it chained to the past."

One, a teenager, Ari, left as his thirst for knowledge came into conflict with religious restrictions. “Wikipedia,” he says, “was a gift from God.” He attends a Christian gathering simply out of curiosity. He also says he has been abused in his past.Another of the three, Luzer, initially seems like the cutup of the bunch, an aspiring actor who lives part-time in Los Angeles and says he had forged his impression of the outside world from furtive movie viewings. We learn later that leaving meant effectively walking away from his family and children.But the most wrenching journey is that of Etty, in her early 30s, who seeks a divorce from a husband who, a title card says, was removed by the police from their home for alleged abuse. (At the start of the film, we hear audio from a 911 call that Etty placed after he was escorted out.) The movie makes the case that the Hasidic community has effectively exploited legal loopholes and financial muscle to win custody battles. Ms. Grady and Ms. Ewing don’t show Etty’s face until a powerful moment midway through the film.As a documentary, “One of Us” is a small act of portraiture, but each portrait captures the pain of having a life upended."

The first is Miriam, a young mother working at an airport in Cancun who was accused, apparently without evidence, of human trafficking. “We call you payers,” she recalls her court-appointed lawyer saying. “People who pay for other people’s crimes.” She was taken to and held at a “self-governing” prison run by gangs, where her family was forced to send money each week for her protection.Adela, the film’s other subject, speaks of her daughter Monica, a college student who disappeared and is suspected of being kidnapped by human traffickers with the help of the local authorities. Adela continues her search for Monica, even as she is threatened with death by criminal groups who demand that she stop.Miriam and Adela tell their tales while Ms. Huezo and her cinematographer, Ernesto Pardo, deliver images that are often only vaguely related to the stories. As the women recount the horrors, we see footage of dark rooms, bus rides or crumbling buildings. Long, languid views of Mexican landscapes, city streets and shipyards are woven with voice-overs that recount tortures, emotional agony and murders.It’s an artful and lyrical assembly; by splitting the audio from the visuals, and filming random strangers rather than the speaker, Ms. Huezo seeks to create a sense that “what happened to Miriam could happen to anybody living in Mexico today,” she writes in her director’s statement.It works."

But behind the facade of a self-assured showman is the secret Mr. Turner tries to keep to himself: He’s blind.Mr. Turner, 63, had rebelled in his youth against the grim prognosis that he would one day lose his eyesight. From his love of TV westerns, he learned the sleights of hand used by cardsharps. Then with an obsessive — and sometimes reckless — energy, he made a career as one of the foremost card magicians in his field, performing at the Magic Castle nightclub in Hollywood, at magic conventions and on TV talk shows.As confident as he appears when shuffling a deck of cards, Mr. Turner remains at odds with his blindness. In a few TV appearances, awkward moments arise when the host clumsily refers to Mr. Turner’s disability before he can illustrate his strength as an illusionist. In candid interviews, he’s open about his discomfort around strangers showering him with sympathy and his attempts to hide his blindness in public by refusing to use a cane or a guide dog.Mr. Korem keeps a reverent distance from his subject, as if not to spoil the magic. The director is either too polite or too timid to push Mr. Turner to reveal more details than he’s comfortable sharing. Such a dynamic personality as Mr. Turner’s could use a more dynamic documentary to illuminate it. As it is, “Dealt” remains a pleasing — if inoffensive — portrait."

Otherwise, this narrative feature debut from Camille Thoman is mostly a frustrating jumble of surreal puzzle pieces that audiences will likely be uninterested in solving.Not that a solution even seems possible. Apparently aiming for an open-ended psychological thriller, Ms. Thoman focuses so fiercely on atmosphere that her narrative isn’t just opaque, it’s a confounding collision of signifiers and symbols. At their center is Miranda (Mireille Enos), an unraveling New York City artist whose work involves invading the privacy of strangers.“You did a bad thing,” her latest victim complains when she builds an exhibit from information purloined from his cellphone. Bad things are something of a habit: When her married lover (Mr. Shepard) sees a violent assault on the street beneath her window, she tells the police — echoing the plot of Curtis Hanson’s 1987 thriller, “The Bedroom Window” — that she was the witness. Stalking a man she recognizes from a police lineup (Goran Visnjic), her behavior grows increasingly paranoid and unhinged. Is she preparing a new art installation, or is someone trying to kill her?If only we cared. Ms. Enos is a credibly fraying voyeur, all anxious looks and nervous starts, but “Never Here” is too emotionally antiseptic to engage. That leaves all the heavy lifting to Sebastian Wintero’s moody, nocturnal cinematography, perfectly paired with James Lavino’s dissonant original score. As Miranda prowls the indigo city streets, bathed in ominous whispers and sharp jabs of neon, you might momentarily forget that the movie around her is a tiny bit bananas."

In last year’s magical “Swiss Army Man,” he played a gassy, much-manhandled corpse; now he’s embracing the muck and mortifications of “Jungle,” a real-life survival tale from the Australian horror specialist Greg McLean.To play the Israeli adventurer Yossi Ghinsberg, Mr. Radcliffe dives into water and quicksand, slathers himself in fire ants, tangles with a snake and excavates a parasite from his forehead. Given that these torments are very much in his director’s wheelhouse, it’s no surprise that they have an energy the rest of the movie (based on Mr. Ghinsberg’s 2005 memoir) lacks.Yet the look is polished and the setup promising as Yossi heads into the Bolivian jungle with two backpacking pals, an American photographer (Alex Russell) and a Swiss teacher (Joel Jackson). Their guide is Karl (Thomas Kretschmann), a sketchy stranger whose possibly menacing motives cry out for an investigation — fictionalized, if necessary — that never comes. Similarly, Yossi’s friends remain essentially enigmas, generic sidekicks without much to distinguish them beyond degrees of daring and propensity for bickering.Slow to get moving and dramatically slack, “Jungle” cares only about Yossi, whose solo suffering and speed-enhanced hallucinations dominate the narrative. Despite Mr. Radcliffe’s all-too-obvious dedication (his increasingly emaciated body, astonishingly, was not digitally enhanced), he can’t rescue a screenplay (by Justin Monjo) that cares more about the condition of his flesh than the contents of his head."

Brett Morgen’s documentary “Jane,” which tells Ms. Goodall’s story largely through footage of her expeditions, is such an absorbing account of her experiences at a reserve in what is now Tanzania that you may not pause to think about how its imagery was captured.If Ms. Goodall — who was 26 and had no scientific degree when she first ventured into the forest, hoping to gain acceptance from chimpanzees inclined to run from her — was mostly exploring on her own, who set up the camera for that incredible shot of her climbing? How is it that the animals are so calm in the presence of moviemaking tools?As an opening title card explains, most of “Jane” comes from 16-millimeter film shot by Hugo van Lawick, the renowned wildlife photographer who joined Ms. Goodall on her travels and eventually became her first husband.ImageThe young chimpanzee Flint as seen in the film.CreditHugo van Lawick/National Geographic CreativeHis footage has appeared before, notably in the 1965 National Geographic documentary “Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees,” narrated by Orson Welles. But Mr. Morgen’s film draws on more than 100 rediscovered hours from National Geographic’s archives. The abundant raw material allows Mr. Morgen to construct the impression of a complete narrative arc, and to show the tedious work of gaining the trust of the chimps and collecting data in fast forward, conveying the excitement of scientific discovery with adventure-movie momentum.Ms. Goodall, who is seen in a fresh interview with Mr. Morgen and heard in excerpts from an audio version of one of her books, narrates her efforts to make contact with the chimps. The footage has been edited in a way that is not strictly faithful to chronology but complements the storytelling. (Even the visuals accompanying the tale of her initial months were filmed later, once Mr. van Lawick had arrived.) Because the archival footage lacked sound, the natural noises — chimp grunts and bird chirps — have been created, seamlessly, from separate recordings made in the Gombe forest that Ms. Goodall once explored.Such editing-suite sleights of hand may displease purists, and so will an insistent score by Philip Glass, whose melodious montage glue has become something of a documentary cliché. But the flip side of such freehandedness is that “Jane,” like Mr. Morgen’s “Chicago 10” and “The Kid Stays in the Picture” (which he directed with Nanette Burstein), is involving and immediate. He fashions a firsthand account of what Ms. Goodall learned about the chimps’ capacity for toolmaking, nurturing and cruelty, and what they taught her when she became a parent herself.“Jane” will delight those familiar with Ms. Goodall and provide a vibrant introduction for newcomers."

Its publicity photos, the personas of band members and their music videos have, since the group’s 1980s beginnings, borrowed from the imagery and style of 20th-century totalitarian regimes. But their music never matched the provocation of their presentation. The critic Robert Christgau once commented: “Not fascists — in fact, probably antifascists. That’s something.”The Norwegian filmmaker Morten Traavik, who has directed a number of Laibach videos, arranged for the group to perform in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2015 as part of wide-ranging official commemorations of the anniversary of Korean liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Mr. Traavik has extensive experience dealing with the country’s bureaucracy. Still, “Liberation Day,” a documentary of preparations for the concert directed by Mr. Traavik and Ugis Olte, is a consistently understated chronicle of Westerners who are very carefully playing with fire. In one scene, some of the band’s technicians complain about the lack of a sound check, as a half-dozen North Korean censors mill about the empty hall. “It is a sound check,” another crew member insists. “It’s not; it’s an exam,” an exasperated roadie grumbles back.Laibach’s music these days is kitschy Europop with Count-Draculaesque vocal croaks up front, courtesy of the singer Milan Fras. The movie is very careful not to reveal the inner workings of the band, but several breadcrumblike clues are dropped by Ivan Novak, a member from early days who now works behind the scenes. But this withholding, intended to maintain Laibach’s mystique, contravenes the ostensible documentary function of the movie."

Nevertheless, in this film he cast two former Bresson “models,” Anne Wiazemsky and Henri de Maublanc, as the lovers Elie and Jean Baptiste. The secret child of the title is, in a sense, the film itself, one in which, according to Mr. Garrel, he “returned to autobiography” after a series of experimental features.But the movie does feature a little boy named Swann who belongs to Elie. The adorable blond moppet, she tells Jean-Baptiste, is the son of a film actor who refuses to acknowledge paternity, even though his mother is raising the child. It reflects Mr. Garrel’s own long love affair with the musical artist Nico, who had a child she said was the son of the French film star Alain Delon. He never acknowledged the boy, but his parents largely raised the child in his early years.Ms. Wiazemsky and Mr. de Maublanc maintain a kind of Bressonian passivity in enacting the dank, entropic spiral that sucks their characters ever downward. They alternately try to maintain, or violently break away from, their intimacy. Mr. Garrel’s approach to narrative here is deliberately provisional; he presents a number of story modules which fragmentedly depict Jean-Baptiste’s mental breakdown, Elie’s mourning over the death of her mother and the couple’s flirtations with potential new lovers and dangerous drugs.Most sad stories of love in our culture express disappointed romanticism. In the world of Mr. Garrel, whose whole work can be seen as an inquiry into the nature of love, romanticism is crushed, slowly and inexorably, yet refuses to die fully. The movie’s few moments of respite from this process are provided through brief shots of the couple walking hand in hand with Swann. Far longer are the shots of them on a park bench in the pouring rain, or sitting on a mattress on an apartment floor, framed by dingy off-white walls.Mr. Garrel’s work has a unique aesthetic that today’s American cinephiles seem to be hungry for; this movie’s long-overdue release here is part of a longer retrospective at the Metrograph. One reason Mr. Garrel’s earlier work has been hard to see in this country is that his early career was more or less as an underground filmmaker — one of the inspirations he cited during a recent New York appearance is Andy Warhol, whom he met through Nico. “L’Enfant Secret” forms a kind of bridge between his more abstract pictures and the narratives of the ’80s and beyond, extending to his latest movie, “Lover for a Day,” which was seen at the New York Film Festival and will have a theatrical run here next year.“L’Enfant Secret” is shot in a black and white that is frequently out of focus, by a camera that’s intentionally not entirely steady. Some shots are reiterated in the ultra-grainy form in which they might have been viewed as rushes, or through a Moviola. Part of Mr. Garrel’s mastery is his ability to make expressive use of what would constitute dire technical flaws in other people’s films. The loose ends, the ragged edges, the awkward cuts: Here they’re like the angry low-fi communication of a postpunk song, desperate in its constricted ability to evoke the ineffable."

After all, Frederick Wiseman, one of nonfiction cinema’s masters, already explored the institution’s ballet company in “La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet” (2009). “The Paris Opera,” which employs similar observational methods, demonstrates the invisibility of Mr. Wiseman’s technique — his genius for drawing out his themes from long scenes of meetings and performances.Covering a wider swatch of the institution more swiftly, “The Paris Opera” feels at once sprawling and insufficiently patient. Even so, it spans a pivotal stretch: The filmmaker, Jean-Stéphane Bron, captured the Paris Opera while it adjusted to the leadership of a new director, Stéphane Lissner, who took over in 2014 and is shown presiding over a period that included the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.The film primarily deals with the institution’s daily challenges, from labor issues to the appropriate cost of a ticket. Mr. Lissner expresses frustration as Benjamin Millepied decides whether to resign as the director of dance after a little more than a year in that position. (Mr. Millepied ultimately left, although the causes of his departure receive superficial treatment.)At its most fun, “The Paris Opera” functions as a stealth backstage chronicle, notably when the man singing the part of Hans Sachs in Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” calls in sick, setting off a scramble to find a last-minute understudy somewhere in Europe. The baritone Michael Kupfer-Radecky assumes the task with humor as bountiful as his voice."

That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.The story of the world’s most famous female superhero, her creators and inspirers, has been told elsewhere, including in Jill Lepore’s book “The Secret History of Wonder Woman.” Ms. Robinson draws on archival sources for her telling and takes some liberties with the historical record, shuffling events around to dovetail with the polymorphous possibilities she’s most interested in. The movie recurrently returns to the 1940s with Marston being grilled by a comic-book skeptic (Connie Britton) about his creation, scenes that fill in some details but also interrupt the fluid narrative flow. These sequences read as a stand-in for the 1950s anti-comic-book crusade of Dr. Fredric Wertham, who condemned Wonder Woman as a “cruel, ‘phallic’ woman.”Dr. Wertham saw cruelty in the Wonder Woman world, but Ms. Robinson sees deep, enduring love in its back story as well as freedom, including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women, and the complex geometry that defined their relationship, may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn’t have Mr. Evans’s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it’s a pleasurable fantasy, as well as a gentle, appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new, excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising, perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but, as Ms. Robinson suggests, there are so many possibilities when you’re given room to play.The real Marston was delightfully unbound. In 1937, Ms. Lepore writes in her book, he held a news conference to announce the coming Amazonian rule. The Washington Post ran with the story: “Neglected Amazons to Rule Men in 1,000 Yrs., Says Psychologist.” The Los Angeles Times went with the punchier “Feminine Rule Declared Fact.” “The next 100 years will see the beginning of an American matriarchy,” Mr. Marston said (2037 here we come!). And “in 1,000 years women will definitely rule this country.” Believing women superior, he thought they had twice “the ability for love” as men, which would allow them to conquer the world. It’s a delicious idea although clearly we could use many more lassos."

He credited the student with having given him a fresh eye on a film he thought he knew backward and forward.One testament to the infinite richness of Hitchcock’s 1960 masterpiece is that it can sustain a film like Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary “78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene.” Although “78/52” discusses the significance of “Psycho” as a whole, Mr. Philippe’s movie is primarily devoted to a close reading of just one sequence: the 78 camera setups and 52 edits that yielded the sudden, violent, waterlogged demise of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Even moviegoers who know “Psycho” backward and forward — who consider it a sacred text and who have read Stephen Rebello’s excellent book “Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ‘Psycho’” — are bound to learn something new from the movie, which addresses the shower scene from critical, historical, theoretical and technical angles, down to the blinding white of the bathroom tiles.Many of the original cast and crew members are no longer alive and are featured only in archival interviews, although seeing Marli Renfro, the pinup model who served as Janet Leigh’s body double, is a special treat. Much of the movie’s appeal lies in the more off-kilter observations: The curator Timothy Standring discusses the particular version of “Susanna and the Elders” that hangs over Norman Bates’s peephole and notes that, of all the renditions of that scene, the one Hitchcock used strongly connotes voyeurism. Guillermo del Toro expounds on how the shower scene expresses Hitchcock’s Catholic sense of guilt — it shows Marion, who has committed adultery and theft, trying to cleanse herself of a sin that can’t be washed away.But given that the shower scene is perhaps the most brilliantly edited sequence in movie history, it’s no surprise that the editors have much to say. Walter Murch, who took part in creating a tribute to the shower scene in “The Conversation,” annotates portions of Hitchcock’s sequence cut by cut. Amy E. Duddleston, the editor of Gus Van Sant’s 1998 not-quite replica of a remake, looks at the differences between the original and her version, pondering why hers didn’t play. Mr. Rebello relays a funny anecdote (also in his book) about how Hitchcock selected just the right variety of melon — casaba — to mimic the sound of a knife piercing flesh.Not all the interviews are equally sharp (it’s not clear why Elijah Wood had to be here), and it’s easy to tell who is dabbling and who has pored over the sequence again and again to understand its effect. It’s a screen moment to treat with total reverence — and so enduring it could sustain “78/52: Part 2.”"

Avraham and Shraga inherited the building from their parents. Despite the fact that they look to be of a pretty advanced age themselves, the fellows still seem in need of a parent of sorts.When a company called Home Clean Home comes in and takes action, the head of the crew begins to work not just as a sanitation manager but as a therapist to the brothers. “I’m sad to see you like this,” the Home Clean Home man (he’s never named) says to one twin after a particularly brutal sweep has been executed in one section of the house.“It has to be done,” sighs the shamed resident, taking solace in a glass of wine. “I’m addicted to the alcohol,” he explains.The movie, directed by Antonio Tibaldi and Alex Lora, is quiet and quietly moving and quite different from “Hoarders” in its steady pace and poetic vérité style. It’s a story of unlikely friendship — not to mention a potentially very good promotional tool for Home Clean Home, which does a thorough and, more to the point, exquisitely sensitive job."

This difficulty in isolating specific people — really seeing them as sovereign beings rather than as an undifferentiated mass — is crucial to the meaning of the documentary, which charts the global refugee and migrant crisis. Shot over the course of one year in 23 countries, the movie tracks the here and there of people whose relentless ebbing and flowing make startlingly visible what news headlines repeatedly suggest: that ours is an age of ceaseless churn with no calm in sight.A Chinese dissident now living in Berlin, Mr. Ai is a major art-world figure who’s had a more modest cinematic profile until now. He’s directed other nonfiction titles, and is the subject of Alison Klayman’s very fine feature documentary, “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,” which was shot when he was still living in China. Although Mr. Ai occasionally shows up in “Human Flow,” in oblique glimpses and hovering at the edges of the frame, he plays an appropriately discreet role in his own documentary. In one scene, he walks along a waterfront where refugees are arriving by boat; elsewhere, he comforts a distraught woman and, to his credit, makes the scene about her and not him.Mr. Ai’s ambition in “Human Flow” is as expansive as his reach and his apparently deep-pocketed resources. (More than 200 crew members, including a half-dozen drone operators, were involved in this worldwide journey.) Some documentaries find multitudes in fixed locations, as is the case with Gianfranco Rosi’s “Fire at Sea,” about an Italian island that’s become a destination for African, Asian and Middle Eastern refugees. Mr. Ai instead takes an ambulatory approach and wanders the globe, traveling to Africa (Kenya), Southeast Asia (Malaysia) and the Middle East (Israel, Jordan) as well as to North America and many ports of call throughout Europe.“Human Flow” opens and closes with aquatically themed imagery, beginning with a shot of a deep, dazzlingly blue body of water. It’s a soothing, almost meditative vision as well as a seductive dream of nature as a balm and refuge. This pacific picture, though, is soon replaced by far more disturbing, recurrent images of perilously small boats filled with frantically shouting, gesturing men, women and children seeking asylum. In one makeshift port and then another there is splashing and disembarking and then cries and hugs as babies are gingerly passed from hand to hand. It’s a distressing, familiar scene in some ways, one that has been playing on our televisions for years.ImageA scene from “Human Flow.”CreditAmazon StudiosWhat Mr. Ai seeks is to go far beyond the nightly news; he wants to give you a sense of the scale of the crisis, its terrifying, world-swallowing immensity. And so he jumps from one heartbreak to the next, passes through Gaza, drops into Pakistan, spends time in Turkey and ambles along the border separating (somewhat) Mexico and the United States, where an American border guard rather ridiculously tries to explain where Mr. Ai can and cannot go. Mr. Ai also visits a number of refugee camps that range from the squalid to the unimaginable and, as he does throughout, he shows you both the dignity and the misery at street level before using drones to soar over the camps.These drone views help give “Human Flow” a velvety smooth look that is occasionally punctuated by jagged cellphone images, at least some of which Mr. Ai seems to have shot. Drone visuals can come off as faddish, gimmicky, but the airborne material here consistently puts Mr. Ai’s ideas into pure, visual terms. He incorporates reams of information in the movie, sometimes through interviews or through data that crawls along the screen, ticker-tape style. Every so often, he folds in an elegant or haunting quote, giving you something to think about as the camera shows a world in which, step by step, crisis by crisis, borders have become by turns absurd and immaterial."
"7379","Marshall","PG-13",0,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: In ‘Marshall,’ a Legal Pioneer Gives History a Shove","Reginald Hudlin’s movie about the crusading lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall smartly keeps the focus tight.","2017-10-12","2017-10-13","2017-11-12 17:44:02",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html,Read the New York Times Review of Marshall,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/arts/13marshall-web/13marshall-web-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Some biopics go for sweeping and exhaustive, trying to cram an entire life into a tidy two hours or so. “Marshall” smartly opts for modest. With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.“Marshall” also stumbles somewhat with the he-said, she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph, whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances, especially in the zippy courtroom scenes, drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism, and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson’s performance, with its brassy and brittle notes, and its counterfeit hauteur, comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn’t do much for courtroom suspense, and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown, a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far."

Yet despite laws dictating that her indigenous performances remain private, Te Ata eventually acted and danced on Broadway and for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s White House. She became an advocate, through her own artistic excellence, for the inherent dignity that the federal government denied American Indians — fittingly, her stage name means “bearer of the morning.” Te Ata’s life story is now the subject of Nathan Frankowski’s film “Te Ata,” which goes for the sweep of an epic despite a tight budget.As depicted, Te Ata, who died in 1995 at the age of 99, grew up as Mary Frances Thompson in the Indian Territory that later became Oklahoma. She devoted her life to relaying the Chickasaw legends she had learned in childhood, in addition to the stories that were shared with her by the diverse American Indian audiences she met on tour.Produced by Chickasaw Nation Productions, “Te Ata” valorizes this little-known hero, introducing elements of myth like a wandering white wolf to mark Te Ata’s life as its own Chickasaw legend. The film sprawls from the Oklahoma plains to old New York, murkily conveying the passage of time and her rising social status. But the movie’s driving force is its mythic performance scenes, which are choreographed, sung and acted with clear, balletic conviction by the film’s star, Q’orianka Kilcher, who collaborated with Chickasaw researchers and advisers. In the film’s most compelling parallel, just as Te Ata grew to be a voice for American Indians who lacked representation, Ms. Kilcher offers her star power on behalf of the Chickasaw."

In his new movie, “The Foreigner,” which he also helped produce, he loses his joie de vivre soon after the opening credits.Here he plays a single father named Quon, who, as the movie opens, is seen dropping off his daughter at a boutique in London so she can buy a dress for a dance. Then a terrorist bombing blows the block to smithereens and turns Quon into an aspiring avenger. After facing roadblocks with the local authorities, he trains his sights on Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish political operative who, Quon is convinced, knows something about the “authentic I.R.A.” that is claiming responsibility for the bombing.What’s that, you ask? “Authentic I.R.A.?” Why, yes, apparently. In this film’s convoluted scenario, jam-packed with morally bankrupt people doing ugly things to one another, a Northern Irish faction is making an aggressive comeback. The movie, directed by Martin Campbell, is based on a novel called “The Chinaman,” by Stephen Leather, whose I.R.A.-heavy plot may have made sense when it was written in 1992. This boneheaded update practically defines the term scab picking.But back to the action: Cryptically, and implacably, demanding names of the perpetrators, Quon pursues Hennessy to his country home and makes like a senior-citizen Rambo in the woods. Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn’t deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father. For what it’s worth, Mr. Brosnan, as Quon’s nemesis, sells the angry-all-the-time requirement for his character."

The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him. The protests are mainly a backdrop to Boonie’s story, though. While the film ends at a logical stopping point, it feels incomplete. It probably could have used a few more years of filming."

In “Tom of Finland,” a primarily Finnish-language feature from Dome Karukoski, the biography is that of Touko Laaksonen (Pekka Strang), the Finnish advertising designer who, under the name Tom of Finland, published drawings of hyper-muscular, well-endowed men and became famous for expanding perceptions on the portrayal of gay life in art.While Mr. Laaksonen devoted his life (1920-91) to challenging conventions, the film is committed to honoring them. The movie traces Mr. Laaksonen’s service in World War II, his experience with public-park cruising and discrimination, and his early illustrations of aggrandized masculinity. (He says the pictures would be easier to publish in the Vatican than in Finland, where homosexuality was outlawed at the time.) His sister (Jessica Grabowsky), a fellow artist, suspicious of his sexuality, dares him to kiss a woman in a game of truth-or-dare.Tom’s eureka moment comes when he visits California. Police officers raid a party, appearing as if they’re about to arrest the gay revelers. False alarm: “We’re looking for a suspect who just robbed a mini mart down on Sunset,” one officer says.If the film emphasizes the power that Mr. Laaksonen’s drawings held for the gay community, it’s less interested in his reception as a boundary-breaking artist, a kindred spirit to the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, among others.

He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe, “Breathe” is all too content to do just that."

Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here. During its quiet moments, we can only watch this priest comfort the despaired and hope that he succeeds."

Waking up on her birthday in a strange man’s dorm room after a supposed one night stand, she stumbles through her day until, en route to her surprise party that night, she is brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Unfortunately, she’s about to experience this particular day again — multiple times.Niftily paced and tight as a chokehold, the script (by the comic-book writer Scott Lobdell) delivers just enough variation to hold our interest. The means of Tree’s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she’s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it’s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who’s the natural comedian. Encased in preppy separates and armed with withering put-downs, Danielle is every bit as deadly as any campus killer."

Luxury buildings are being erected everywhere. The earth is always being moved and cranes reach into the sky.There, 18-year-old Bora (Sobon Nuon) has come from his rural village to work in construction and send some of his earnings back home. He and several other young men labor during the days, then together stroll the vibrantly lit world after dark. One evening Bora runs into Solei (Cheanick Nov), his brother, who left the family years earlier.The two begin to reestablish their relationship, and soon there’s tension as Bora is pulled between his new friends and his long-lost brother. But the film is mostly concerned with following these teenagers as they navigate such an uncertain stage of their lives. Scenes set at night are hypnotic in their colors and their sense of sweet melancholy; the men’s successes and failures at finding love are gentle and moving.“Diamond Island” runs long in its final act as the script, by Mr. Chou and Claire Maugendre, dwells on its theme of a land and its people undergoing constant change. As with a dream, you can parse what you’ve watched for meaning or just savor what you’ve seen. For this compassionate film, either way works fine."

The resonances begin with its title. “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker, J. D. Salinger and, to some extent, Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout, but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise.After the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: “Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.” The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off.VideoNoah Baumbach narrates a sequence from his film, featuring Ben Stiller and Dustin Hoffman.Published OnOct. 12, 2017CreditCreditAtsushi Nishijima/NetflixThis is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When “Head to Toe,” a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car’s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn’t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy.But Danny’s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit — Eliza just for a night, as she’s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he’s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can’t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world’s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza’s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named “Pagina-Man,” is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season.ImageDustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson in Noah Baumbach’s latest film.CreditAtsushi Nishijima/NetflixNone of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold’s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says “I think this is my copy of ‘Buddenbrooks.’”With this film, Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In “The Squid and the Whale” and “Margot at the Wedding,” something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing, though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as “The Meyerowitz Stories” gets, it is a more mellow film, and to my eyes and ears all the better for it.As is customary in Mr. Baumbach’s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller’s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.Mr. Baumbach’s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn’t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind."

This annual phenomenon can lead to theaters clogged with old-lady bait, which usually means something British and upper-crusty, preferably with literary roots. A dollop of war, a death or two, and it’s off to the awards races.“Goodbye Christopher Robin” checks all the boxes. Drenched in dappled light and Carter Burwell’s honeyed score, Simon Curtis’s glowing picture dangles the story of how the author A. A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) created the Winnie-the-Pooh tales using the stuffed animals of his son, Christopher Robin (beautifully played by little Will Tilston). What we’re really watching, though, is no less than a stiffly depressing portrait of toffee-nosed child abuse.As the shellshocked Milne newly returned from the Western Front, Mr. Gleeson wears a virtually unvarying expression of acute intestinal distress. Unable to connect with the infant or continue to write his popular plays, Milne drags the child and his ghastly wife (Margot Robbie) — “I had a baby to cheer you up!,” she whines — to the paradisiacal forest in Sussex where the books will take shape.Erratically paced and with a pitch-black heart, the movie manipulates at every turn. There is bonding and betrayal and the loss of a beloved nanny (a warm Kelly Macdonald) as Christopher becomes a marketable commodity. Yet though traumatized by celebrity and the cruelty of his schoolmates, he still desires only one thing.“Come on, Mr. Milne, a little affection please,” a photographer coaxes while snapping a portrait of father and son. Not likely."

She lives in the shadow of Disney World, in a stretch of central Florida dominated by cheap thrills and off-brand amusements. Home is a room in a motel called the Magic Castle, one of many garishly painted stucco-clad palaces whose names represent either false advertising, honest aspiration or brutal irony. This is an unmagical kingdom, a zone of tawdriness and transience, of strip clubs and strip malls, knockoff souvenir shops and soft-serve ice cream shacks.But for Moonee (who is played by an uncannily poised and resourceful young actress named Brooklynn Prince), the Magic Castle and its surroundings are a land of endless enchantment and nonstop adventure. Mischievous and fearless — heroically bratty; devilishly cute — Moonee may remind you of Eloise, who tries the patience of the grown-ups at the Plaza Hotel in that immortal picture book. Their situations are different, of course. Moonee’s mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), is not jetting around Europe leaving her daughter in the care of a stressed-out nanny. She’s very much a presence in Moonee’s life, perhaps more big-sisterly than maternal, but doing whatever she can to keep them housed, clothed, fed and entertained.VideoSean Baker narrates a sequence from the film featuring Willem Dafoe, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.Published OnJan. 25, 2018CreditCreditMarc Schmidt/A24What “Eloise” shares with “The Florida Project,” Sean Baker’s risky and revelatory new film, is the ability to tell its young heroine’s story from two perspectives at once. Moonee’s free-range existence looks like a lot of fun, and she and her friends — mostly a boy named Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and sometimes a girl named Jancey (Valeria Cotto) — run wild with an exuberance that adult viewers can only envy. Moonee and Scooty are like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; the service road is their Mississippi River. They cook up pranks and follow their whims, heedless of the consequences.But of course the viewer who experiences vicarious delight in their capers — ice cream tastes so much sweeter when you have conned some tourists into paying for it — is simultaneously conscious of an undertow of sorrow, anxiety and dread. We are well aware of the possible consequences, and also of the grim circumstances that grant Moonee her freedom. She is in every sense a child at risk. We watch her Little Rascal antics increasingly sure that something terrible is going to happen.To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does — to interweave giddiness and heartbreak — is no easy feat. “The Florida Project” could easily have been cruel and exploitative, punishing its characters for their wildness and the audience for enjoying it. But the director, who wrote the script with Chris Bergoch, avoids the traps of condescension and prurience that ensnare too many well-meaning movies about poverty in America. Like Mr. Baker’s earlier features “Starlet” and “Tangerine,” this movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are, on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding.ImageWillem Dafoe and Brooklynn Prince in ""The Florida Project.""CreditA24[The Magic and Hardship of “The Florida Project”]“Tangerine,” an against-the-clock chronicle of a hectic day in the lives of two transgender hustlers in Los Angeles, won some of its fame for having been shot with an iPhone camera. “The Florida Project” has a more polished look, but the bright colors and rough, warm edges of Alexis Zabé’s cinematography fit the mood and the setting. You see traces of the near-tropical natural glory that drew generations of hedonists, fortune-hunters and entrepreneurs to this part of the Sunshine State. You also find some beauty in the blight they brought with them.Halley and the other parents and grandparents trying to raise children in the motels are part of that history, chasing dreams that seem at once fanciful and mundane: celebrity, wealth, a steady job, a stable home. All of these things seem equally out of reach and tantalizingly close at hand, and the same consumer economy that creates such precariousness also provides a steady stream of pleasure and diversion.The steadiest adult presence in Moonee’s world is Bobby (Willem Dafoe, never better), who runs (but does not own) the Magic Castle. You get the feeling that Bobby didn’t exactly sign up to be the de facto mayor of a makeshift village, but he also clearly finds some satisfaction in managing the disorder that surrounds him. He’s gentle with the children even when they drive him crazy and disrupt his work, and watches over them when nobody is looking. (In one of the film’s most gripping and sharply constructed scenes, Bobby confronts a creepy, predatory interloper who has been hanging around the motel’s playground.) His observant, unassuming decency makes him, to some degree, the filmmaker’s surrogate.“The Florida Project” is honest about the limits of benevolence, and about the wishful thinking that can cloud our understanding of the world. Its final scenes are devastating, and also marvelously ambiguous, full of wonder, fury and cleareyed self-criticism. No magic exists that can make the pain of reality disappear, but we don’t know how to believe in anything else. This movie accomplishes something almost miraculous — two things, actually. It casts a spell and tells the truth."

A small woman with a two-toned pageboy and an open, unsentimental manner, she is an ideal traveling companion: a wise and canny guide, an impetuous risk-taker, a trusted friend.Her recent documentaries, while not exactly confessional, are unabashedly personal, infused with her voice, her eye, her wry and rueful on-camera presence. Each film is a map of her thinking, a record of her musings and insights as she explores parts of the modern world — especially but not exclusively France — that less attentive voyagers might overlook.The latest of these adventures, “Faces Places,” finds Ms. Varda in the company of a younger comrade, the 34-year-old French photographer and environmental artist known as JR. Together they set out on a series of meandering road trips through agricultural and industrial towns, talking to people and taking their pictures. (The French title, “Visages Villages,” is more specific than the English version about the kinds of places that interest them.) JR’s van is equipped with a printer that produces portraits big enough to cover the sides of barns, houses and apartment buildings and even, magnificently, a towering stack of shipping containers.The easygoing, episodic structure of their journey gives “Faces Places” a deceptively casual air. It superficially resembles one of those ubiquitous cable-television shows in which a semi-celebrity bounces around the globe tasting the food and philosophizing with the locals. Ms. Varda and JR, who is tall and stylish and never takes off his sunglasses, are a charming pair. Their subjects are happy to chat, and touched (if also sometimes a little embarrassed) to behold their likenesses turned into large-scale public art installations. The film works just fine as an anthology of amiable encounters and improvised collaborations.But it’s a lot more than that. Despite its unassuming, conversational ethos — which is also to say by means of Ms. Varda’s staunchly democratic understanding of her job as a filmmaker — “Faces Places” reveals itself as a powerful, complex and radical work. Ms. Varda’s modesty is evidence of her mastery, just as her playful demeanor is the expression of a serious and demanding aesthetic commitment. Almost by stealth, but also with cheerful forthrightness, she communicates a rich and challenging array of feelings and ideas. As we contemplate those faces and places we are invited to reflect on the passage of time and the nature of memory, on the mutability of friendship and the durability of art, on the dignity of labor and the fate of the European working class.Ms. Varda and JR visit a town in France’s northern coal-producing region where the mines have shut down. They call on a prosperous farmer, on factory workers and retirees, on a group of longshoremen and their wives. Without pressing a political agenda or bringing up matters of ideology or identity, they evoke a history of proud struggle and bitter defeat, a chronicle etched in the stones of the villages and the lines on the faces.Beneath the jauntiness and good humor there is an unmistakably elegiac undertone to this film, an implicit acknowledgment of lateness and loss. The places will crumble and the faces will fade, and the commemorative power of the images that JR and Ms. Varda make will provide a small and partial compensation for this gloomy inevitability. The world and its inhabitants are protean and surprising, but also almost unbearably fragile, and you feel the pull of gravity even in the film’s most lighthearted passages.Ms. Varda, steeped in the traditions of the avant-garde, is resistant to nostalgia — there’s always too much to notice here and now — but she finds herself drawn to retrospection. Her glance turns backward, to her own earlier work and to her relationships with colleagues and friends. She tells JR that he reminds her of Jean-Luc Godard, her erstwhile comrade in the heady, heroic days of the French new wave. Mr. Godard in his 30s favored dark glasses and an impish, enigmatic air, and he plays an intriguing off-camera role in “Faces Places.” He is muse and villain, a source of inspiration and exasperation, a secret sharer and a vengeful ghost.He’s probably not so vain that he thinks this movie is about him. And Ms. Varda is too generous to make it all about her, even though no one else could have made it. “Faces Places” is unforgettable, not because of dramatic moments or arresting images, but because once you have seen it you want to keep it with you, like a talisman or a souvenir. Wherever you’re going, it will surely come in handy."

For one thing, the buildup is so grippingly patient that we’re more than halfway through before the titular battleground is reached. And for another, this painstakingly paced thriller displays an intensity of purpose that makes it impossible to dismiss as well-executed trash.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie stars a revelatory Vince Vaughn as Bradley Thomas, a recovering alcoholic, laid-off mechanic and newly expectant father. A charismatic bruiser with a baby-soft face and piledriver body, Bradley favors a dry turn of phrase — when asked how he’s doing, he responds “South of OK, north of cancer” — and a placid demeanor. This last is blown when, early on, we watch him rip apart his wife’s car with his bare hands.He has good reason. But the implacability of the act, and the meticulous deconstruction of the vehicle, reveals not only Bradley’s brute strength and boiling point, but also his director’s death grip on style and tempo. And when Bradley’s temporary drug-running job with an old associate (Marc Blucas) goes south and he’s forced to navigate a series of increasingly atrocious confinements, Mr. Zahler and his cinematographer, Benji Bakshi, never lose focus. Rejecting the jittery shooting style and sped-up splatter that distinguishes so many modern action movies — where mayhem flashes past too swiftly to register as a valid plot point or viable moral outcome — they plant their camera with such eerie stillness that every punch has traction.There are a lot of punches. Like Mr. Zahler’s 2015 debut, the clever horror-western “Bone Tomahawk,” “Brawl” features violence that’s lurid and often ludicrous. (At some point, I lost count of the heads being mashed, bashed and ground into the dirt.) Yet Bradley, stripped to a single, galvanizing intention — to save his kidnapped wife (Jennifer Carpenter) and unborn daughter by killing a high-value inmate — never loses our sympathy. His fundamental decency has been so carefully established (even the detective questioning him knows this is no ordinary lug) that the medieval damage he inflicts with fists and feet seems, if not always justifiable, at least understandable.The role must have been punishing, but, perhaps for the first time, Mr. Vaughn seems comfortable in his towering body. Bradley isn’t flyweight-nimble, he’s a battering ram, and the director wisely surrounds him with wickedly agile supporting players. Both Don Johnson and the great Udo Kier are memorably repulsive as a sadistic warden and a slimy go-between, and Fred Melamed is chillingly hilarious as a persnickety prison intake officer.But it’s Mr. Vaughn, with his loose-hipped gait and simmering menace, who brings the movie home. Wrapped in a swaggering soundtrack of ’70s-style soul (composed by Mr. Zahler and Jeff Herriott, and performed by the likes of Butch Tavares and the O’Jays), he gives Bradley a forlorn determination. There is something so poignant in the performance that it lifts this uncompromisingly savage picture above and beyond its vicious beat-downs. Bradley’s wife may be pregnant, but it’s the actor who plays him who could experience new life."

Their perseverance is cheering, giving the movie a brightly buoyant tone that belies the suffering at its center and renders the sometimes distracting musical score largely unnecessary.Assisted by archival film originally shot for earlier projects, the directors, Kief Davidson and Pedro Kos, build a 30-year-plus dramatic timeline that focuses most intently on Dr. Farmer (who was also profiled in Tracy Kidder’s 2003 book, “Mountains Beyond Mountains”). His quiet outrage over the widely-held assumption that it’s futile to treat the global poor drives this story, which is finally as much about the triumph of a philosophy as of medicine.Dr. Kim agrees. “Optimism is a moral choice,” he says, one that undergirds programs grounded in extreme practicality. You don’t have to be an altruist to accept that pandemics are best averted in the countries where they typically begin."

It” follows Heidi, a precocious 12-year-old girl with an unusual lucky streak, as she travels alone in search of her family history. Heidi (Talitha Bateman) lives with her intellectually disabled mother, Mama (Jessica Collins), whom she cares for with help from her agoraphobic neighbor, Bernadette (Alfre Woodard). Her mother’s difficulty with communicating leaves Heidi at a loss about her own origins, including her family name. So when Heidi finds photos of Mama during her pregnancy, she takes her luck on the road in hopes of finding answers.The film’s director, Stephen Gyllenhaal, brings an efficient style to this largely performance-driven adventure. As the movie’s young lead, Ms. Bateman develops a genuine rapport with veteran actors like Ms. Woodard, and she summons an impressive focus to her performance as Heidi, capturing the conflict of a child who feels responsible for more than she might be emotionally equipped to process.But the treatment of Mama creates a snag in this delicate movie. Based on the children’s novel by Sarah Weeks, “So B. It” hinges on Mama’s lack of agency — it’s her inability to express herself that spurs the other characters to action. Ms. Collins, who does not share her character’s disability, makes earnest efforts to alter her speech patterns and adhere to a different physicality. But she also has to serve the plot, repeating words that will provide clues for Heidi, acting out at key times, shutting down in others.The result is that Mama feels like a false, even convenient, approximation of a disabled person. “So B. It” aims for an inclusive message. But Mama’s artificiality makes it hard to buy the movie’s themes of acceptance."

We learn how he pioneered using Jet Skis to tow surfers to unreachable peaks and still experiments with retrofitting boards. He conquered waves thought to be unconquerable and performed feats of derring-do off Tahiti and Maui. (Though a spot he helped discover off Maui became touristy partly because of footage that he and his comrades shot to make money — bummer.)The more mind-numbing hagiographic interludes deal with Mr. Hamilton’s introduction to celebrity, including posing for the fashion photographer Bruce Weber and starring in the surfing movie “North Shore,” which apparently left some viewers thinking he was the jerk he played. Mr. Hamilton’s wife, colleagues and beleaguered orthopedic surgeon seem resigned to indulging his yen for danger. The star and his friends offer harrowing accounts of improbable rescues.But the documentary stirs up most of its sporadic excitement in the surfing footage, of which there is plenty. The imagery, especially the aerial shots, gives a sense of Mr. Hamilton’s precision and how close he comes to wiping out."

In a matching cut, Rooney Mara, playing the same character years later, stands in a dark room with strangers as strobe lights flash and a synthetic percussion track throbs. Regardless of what the director, Benedict Andrews, intends, the aggregate effect is “Something bad happened to this person and now she’s into EDM.”The Scottish playwright David Harrower adapted his two-character play “Blackbird” for the screen, substantially changing it to include flashbacks.In the play, Ray (Ben Mendelsohn) and Una (Ms. Mara) are a sex offender and his victim. In a confrontational meeting when she is an adult, they go over the knotty circumstances of the abuse, which culminated in their running away together.Mr. Harrower expands the number of characters, to the extent that subplots form around them. These become actively distracting. In addition, Mr. Andrews, via tricksy lighting and focus effects, announces repeatedly that this is a film (his first, after years of high-profile work in theater and opera).“I was never one of them,” Ray insists to Una when she tracks him down at the warehouse where he works, under an assumed name, after serving his prison sentence. As they recollect the past, an uncomfortable emotional intertwining seems to occur; the scenes that leave Ms. Mara and Mr. Mendelsohn alone are, tellingly, the most interesting and effective ones. Their performances are tightly focused and unflinching; too bad they are surrounded by a lot of heavy-handed, poorly aimed cinematic showing off."

Johnson,” a documentary that, in trying to tell them all, takes on too much.Marsha P. Johnson was a transgender activist who played important roles in the Stonewall Riots and the gay-rights movement. Her body was found in the Hudson River in 1992, and while the police labeled her death a suicide, many of her friends suspected she was murdered.Victoria Cruz of the New York City Anti-Violence Project has been exploring the case, and to watch her track down retired detectives and follow potential leads is to see a determined soul at work. By itself, the investigation raises red flags about crime, discrimination and police apathy — more than enough material to supply this film.Yet David France, the director, switches focus often, running extensive footage of past gay-rights gatherings and a recent trial of a man who murdered a transgender woman, as well as interviews with Ms. Johnson’s friends, fellow activists and more. All are inseparable from Ms. Johnson’s story and deserve a place here. But as assembled, the film soon turns scattershot. More strangely, for a documentary whose title implies a look at Ms. Johnson’s life, there are few insights into her early years. Bryce Dessner’s music promises tension that the script, by Mr. France and Mark Blane, only occasionally delivers.It’s no spoiler to say that, at the end, several mysteries remain unsolved here. Though this film doesn’t give definitive answers on what happened to Ms. Johnson, it keeps her memory alive. That itself is a victory over indifference."

Paired with an aloof Kate Winslet — with whom he has less chemistry than he did with Wood Harris, who played his business partner on “The Wire” — he works very hard to appear oblivious to the script’s many idiocies. He does not succeed.A disaster movie by any definition, this sappy adaptation of Charles Martin’s 2010 novel places Ben (Mr. Elba), a melancholy neurosurgeon, on a charter plane to Denver with Alex (Ms. Winslet), a supremely irritating photojournalist. Having joined forces when their commercial flight from Idaho was grounded by a storm, the two are further dismayed when their folksy pilot (Beau Bridges) suffers a stroke and smashes them into a snowy peak. Now they have to rescue not just themselves, but the pilot’s golden Labrador — which has no name and, apparently, no appetite.Caught between the harsh demands of a survival story and the emotional beats of a romantic drama, the director, Hany Abu-Assad, grabs hold of neither. As the pair traipse to safety, artifice rules: A cougar is dispatched with shameless ease; an abandoned cabin manifests just in time to save a life and — almost three weeks into their ordeal — allow the couple to enjoy what is almost certainly malodorous sex. I half expected them to discover the fixings for a full English breakfast.On the upside, the frozen landscapes (shot in Canada by Mandy Walker) are lovely, and the dog is adorable. It’s incredible that neither one of our starving lovers thought to eat it."

The two have been estranged, and there’s friction between them as they reunite for a trek into the mountains.While hiking together they tell tales and recall their pasts. But before you can say “I hope there are no bears around,” they end up sustaining injuries that force them to rely on each other as they struggle to return to civilization.The story line is well-trod, and reminiscent in parts of “The Revenant,” “Mountain Men” and several other films that take place in rough country. Yet Mr. Bomer and Mr. Wiggins are proficient with the sparse dialogue (written by the brothers and directors Alex and Andrew Smith, from a short story by David Quammen), and with situations that are occasionally contrived.Though it’s not high praise to describe the movie as watchable, it’s no rebuke either. The biggest stars here are the Montana locations. They are catnip to the cinematographer, Todd McMullen, who rarely misses a chance to frame the landscape at ground level and from above.For a largely two-man drama (Bill Pullman appears in flashbacks as Cal’s father) “Walking Out” acquits itself well enough — serviceable is another apt description. The survival story, you’ve seen before. The scenery, you can’t see enough of."

The film is relayed in flashback by three characters, each addressing the camera directly, as if speaking to an unseen interrogator. The director, Andrei Konchalovsky, even includes scratches on the film, to enhance the sense that we’re watching documentary evidence.One narrator is Jules (Philippe Duquesne), a Vichy French police officer who, we learn, tried to extract information from one of the others, a Russian woman, Olga (Julia Vysotskaya), imprisoned after working with the French Resistance. But Jules’s perspective is quickly sidelined for that of the third narrator-confessor: Helmut (Christian Clauss), an ambitious SS officer who delayed his thesis on Chekhov for wartime duties and who buys into Hitler’s propaganda in full.The central dynamic is between Olga and Helmut, who had a romantic encounter in 1933 and met again when she became a prisoner in the concentration camp where he was working. We see how he took her in, with ulterior motives, as a house cleaner, garnering her resentment within the camp for the special privileges she received.All three have moments of cruelty and unexpected tenderness. Jules is mostly irrelevant, except to provide a muddled contrast with Helmut. And while Mr. Konchalovsky, a Russian-born filmmaker who has also worked in the United States (the 1985 Jon Voight thriller “Runaway Train”), shows a flair for imagery that evokes the “Citizen Kane” photography of Gregg Toland, his message seems lost in a mire of ambition and good intentions."

Now in his early 30s, Scott is around the age his father was when playing the amiable cowboy Rowdy Yates in the television series “Rawhide.” The younger Eastwood’s resemblance to his father, and similarity in manner, is such that it sometimes feels as if a younger version of Clint has been digitally spliced into this picture. This is diverting, more so than the actual movie, unfortunately. The dialogue seems to have been composed by a screenwriting bot. Here’s an actual exchange between the brothers:“After this job, I’m done.”“When were you thinking of telling me?”“I just did.”The colorless, TV-series-cheesy direction by Antonio Negret is no help. The brothers’ seductive counterparts, played by Ana de Armas and Gaia Weiss, mostly flounder until a triple-cross-scenario calls on them to deliver punch lines. And so on. The car chases are O.K., but not O.K. enough."

The new film “Dina,” which advertises itself as a “real-life romantic comedy,” is an unusually penetrating example of this type of picture. Made by the directing team of Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini, it gets very close to a couple, Dina Buno and Scott Levin, as they plan their wedding.The movie opens with Dina, voluble and vulnerable, asking a dental assistant to take her hand before a dentist drills into a bothersome tooth. The viewer soon learns that Dina is autistic, as is Scott (he refers to himself as “an Aspy”). Her symptoms are, in fact, milder than Scott’s, but a past that scarred her both physically and emotionally compounds problems.They are a sweet couple whom you want to root for, and their conditions and circumstances have imbued them with personalities that some might perceive as quirky. Recalling his proposal to Dina, Scott enthuses to friends, “Red Robin, what a romantic place to get hitched.”Documentaries like this maintain their spell only if they keep the viewer from wondering, “What the hell is the camera doing here?” I lasted until a scene from their honeymoon, in which Dina fills up a champagne-glass shaped bathtub; Scott, who has trouble even conceiving of physical intimacy, is seemingly oblivious to the implications of this action.As it happens, there are some reasonable, if not entirely satisfactory, answers to the question, but the viewer won’t learn them during the movie itself. (Mr. Sickles has known Dina his whole life; his father was one of her teachers.) The filmmakers might have cleared up suspicions about their motivations and ethics had they worked them into the narrative."

And yet, given the audacity, gusto and hell-for-leather filmmaking on display, the prospect of subsequent installments does not seem unreasonable.In the future, a corporation housed in a huge complex in the sky looks down upon a desolate world that is home to a penal colony. Into the planet’s dusty wasteland comes Kane Sommerville (the Australian actor Daniel MacPherson), a former military hero who’s seen better days. Kane seeks his 11-year-old daughter, Indi (the promising newcomer Teagan Croft), who dwells in a remote bunker that protects her from external threats like the grizzled, hard-living reprobates who populate the lawless frontier and the bulky, viscous monsters the corporation has bioengineered. Helping Kane is Sy (Kellan Lutz), an escaped convict who has led a revolt at the prison, and two dissolute stepsiblings (Isabel Lucas and Luke Ford).A cellblock riot, a spaceship dogfight, a bar brawl, a hospital trauma, violent encounters with C.G.I. beasts — there is little Mr. Abbess (“Infini”) won’t toss into this delirious, overheated stew. At times he overreaches. But he cherishes his actors (many from his native Australia, where the film was shot), and his bravado has a bracing vigor. With a little restraint, he could go far."

While the film includes footage of Ms. Vargas onstage and recordings of her music, it doesn’t convey the power of her artistry, giving the viewer a sense of why, to paraphrase the musician Miguel Bosé from the film, listeners might believe that she could die from being overwhelmed in the middle of a song. (Separately, we learn that may have been her wish.)Ms. Vargas was born in Costa Rica, moved to Mexico as a child and died there in 2012 at age 93. The movie’s centerpiece is footage of Ms. Vargas speaking for herself, in material that Ms. Gund shot in 1991. These candid conversations have been supplemented with the usual array of photos and talking heads — people who knew Ms. Vargas from collaborations, love and friendship — along with a rundown of the singer’s life.Although she became known for her performances of ranchera, especially songs by the composer José Alfredo Jiménez, Ms. Vargas eschewed the flamboyant hoop skirts and jewelry associated with performers of the genre, wearing pants and earning a reputation for, as it’s described in the film, “singing like a man.” She didn’t come out as a lesbian until the age of 81, but according to the film, her sexuality was no secret. We hear about how she swooned over Frida Kahlo, among many other women. Severe alcoholism stalled her career, until a cabaret performance in Mexico City in the early 1990s rekindled the spark and eventually led to fresh international acclaim. (She did not perform much in the United States; The New York Times interviewed her in 2003 on the occasion of her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 83.)“Chavela lived in a continual state of farewell,” says the director Pedro Almodóvar, who befriended the singer in her later life and used her songs in some of his films. The movie certainly conveys that sense: It plays like a dirge, not a celebration."

Dick, accomplished something more unusual. It sent tendrils of influence — pictorial, conceptual and spiritual — into every corner of the culture and inspired a mystery cult.Like other sacred texts, the film invites doctrinal arguments and esoteric inquiries. One of my fondest memories as a father and a film critic is of an impromptu post-screening seminar with two 11-year-olds about occult meanings and hidden clues in the director’s cut. How do we know (if indeed we do know) that Harrison Ford is a replicant? What is the significance of the origami unicorn? Are Sean Young’s shoulder pads for real?[Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling Discuss “Blade Runner 2049”]Alongside these basic interpretive questions, an academic subfield has blossomed, isolating “Blade Runner” as one of the original symptoms of postmodernism, a terminal and interminable disease of the mind. The film’s blend of curatorial nostalgia and dystopian prophecy captured a mood of self-conscious melancholy in its moment and set a tone of melancholy self-consciousness that has endured ever since. Maybe the real world never quite achieved the smoky neon-noir glow of Mr. Scott’s Los Angeles, but the map of our collective dream world was permanently redrawn.ImageHarrison Ford in “Blade Runner 2049.”CreditStephen Vaughan/Alcon Entertainment, Warner Bros.The precise future “Blade Runner” projected is now less than two years away, and the next chapter, once something to be dreaded, seems, if anything, overdue. “Blade Runner 2049,” directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, tries both to honor the original and to slip free of its considerable shadow. That’s no easy feat, and it’s worth noting right away that, in narrow movie terms, Mr. Villeneuve, who also directed “Arrival,” mostly succeeds. From the opening aerial shots of a thoroughly denatured agricultural landscape and the lethal confrontation that follows, we know we are in the presence of a masterly visual tactician and a shrewd storyteller.[The “Blade Runner 2049” Look]We are also in territory that is both familiar and disorienting. A brief note explains what has and hasn’t changed in the 30 years since the events in the first “Blade Runner.” Three-wheeled spinners still zoom through the California skies, and the building-size video advertisements have evolved into seductive, R-rated holograms. The titular profession — hunting down and “retiring” renegade members of the almost-human, genetically engineered android species known as replicants — is practiced with the same brutal doggedness as in the old days.A new, more obedient type of replicant has been developed by a corporation led by a tech visionary played by Jared Leto. (His lieutenant Luv is played by Sylvia Hoeks, a far more vivid and persuasively terrifying presence than the mannered Mr. Leto.) One of these models is our hero, an L.A.P.D. employee known as K. (It’s an abbreviation of his serial number and also, maybe, an allusion to Franz Kafka’s avatar of modern alienation. That poor fellow’s full name was Josef K; when this K acquires a human pseudonym, it’s Joe.)VideoDenis Villeneuve narrates a sequence from his film featuring Ryan Gosling.Published OnOct. 2, 2017CreditCreditStephen Vaughan/Alcon Entertainment, Warner Bros. PicturesSpeaking of avatars of alienation, K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling’s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it — his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa — makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood’s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul.At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K’s. The whole point of “Blade Runner,” though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K’s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams — that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them — has long been a staple of speculative cinema. “Blade Runner 2049” does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” or Spike Jonze’s “Her,” but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience’s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Arrival” — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.ImageSylvia Hoeks as the character Luv.CreditStephen Vaughan/Alcon Entertainment, Warner Bros. \Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first “Blade Runner” approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?“I know what’s real,” says the hero of that movie when — at long last! — he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do.Which is not something I’m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That’s fair enough, but it’s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott’s “Blade Runner” cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don’t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve’s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then — when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri — you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.Then again: Who knows at this point if that sense of loss, of lost possibility, is even real?

With “Flatliners,” Columbia Pictures takes a bold, innovative step to address this issue.It’s startling in its simplicity. The well-known 1990 movie being remade here is something other than beloved, or classic. Rather it is remembered as a widely-derided post-Brat Pack ensemble piece. (And while the movie was indeed largely derided, The New York Times gave it a positive review, as did the critic Roger Ebert.) The potential for accusations of sacrilege is minimal.The original “Flatliners,” directed by Joel Schumacher from a script by Peter Filardi, teamed the newly minted Julia Roberts with the lesser-known peers Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and Billy Baldwin in an underbaked story of medical students in the grip of a literally morbid obsession. Intent on exploring life after death, they temporarily put themselves into the uncharted territory of brain death (hence the title), with what were supposedly scary side effects relating to the wreckages of their past. Mr. Schumacher’s movie is more a failed tone poem than a horror picture, and to its credit, this new version, with a trickier script by Ben Ripley and hyper-competent direction from the Swedish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev improves on it — by making it behave like a horror movie every now and then.Still. As much as I try not to outsmart the movies I watch, when this one opened with a color-desaturated scene of Ellen Page driving a car with a young girl in the passenger seat, the devil on my shoulder said, “There is going to be a terrible accident, the girl is going to die, and this will spur the Ellen Page character into exploring the afterlife.”I was right. This set the tone for much of the rest of my viewing.Mr. Sutherland shows up here, but he doesn’t reprise his irresponsible character from the first movie; he is a supervisor to the five medical students having after-death adventures, each one a particular type (There’s James Norton’s playboy, Nina Dobrev’s alpha, Kiersey Clemons’s striver and Diego Luna’s Diego Luna), saddled with guilt that haunts them despite their near-death experiences also turning them into super-geniuses.This film did not screen for critics, nor was it previewed in New York theaters on a Thursday night, as is usually customary with studio pictures. I imagine Columbia understood that it had something arguably worse than a dog on its hands. This “Flatliners” is in fact a new definition of “meh.”"

That doesn’t mean this leisurely portrait of its title character, a cantankerous old coot (Harry Dean Stanton, in one of his last roles), is any more eventful at the end than at the beginning. Rather, the accumulation of spot-on performances and long-familiar faces, small-town routines and dusty-worn locations, finally coalesces into a picture that’s greater than the sum of its oft-clichéd parts.Maudlin and meandering, this first feature by the actor John Carroll Lynch could have sprouted organically from the compost of its star’s back catalog. (The script, by Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja, was written as an almost biographical celebration of Mr. Stanton’s life.) We’ve seen him stride through arid desert towns like this before, though now, as Lucky, his gait is more fragile if no less purposeful. Following the same daily routine — an unvarying trek from home to diner to bodega to bar — Lucky would rather watch game shows than engage in small talk. The townsfolk (warmly played by David Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr., among others) don’t seem to mind, and are even quite fond of him, in the way of longtime owners of a rather surly pet.Then, one day, he falls down, and the film subtly shifts from a quietly comical character study to a delicate reflection on loneliness and mortality. As Lucky bonds with a fellow World War II veteran and, in one lovely scene, slides into an impromptu song at a child’s birthday party, the movie is more intent on measuring the weight of a life than contemplating death. So when our cranky hero, a lifelong atheist, declares that there is no soul, it seems an extraordinary line to give an actor who spent his entire career proving otherwise."

In the first, a young man (Woo Ji-hyeon), a little drunk, calls an old friend on the phone and asks him to sing for him. The friend complies with a mournful love song, and the movie seems to hold its breath until the final notes rise into the night air.The second shows an older couple (Yang Heung-ju and Lee Se-rang) enjoying a late-afternoon meal in a modest restaurant. For more than 10 minutes, we listen to them hesitantly converse while the camera barely moves. The natural light around them, however, shifts back and forth from golden to gloomy in seeming accord with their waxing and waning intimacy.Both scenes unfold in the same geographical location — Chuncheon, a resort town on the banks of a man-made lake — but that’s their only obvious commonality. Using a bisected structure and extraordinary patience, Mr. Jang presents two distinct narrative arcs, following the young man for the first half and the couple for the second. Yet the ghosts of the past, of lost connections and missed opportunities, haunt both sections, binding the characters with a single, sorrowful skein.Swaying repeatedly from vibrant seasonal tones to a pearlescent, misty gray, “Autumn, Autumn” has a low-key fretfulness that suggests a darker reading of its ambiguous dual endings. Yet though disappointment and loneliness guide its conversations, the movie isn’t bleak; it’s a touching and tender commentary on the need to be seen and the desire to be heard."

Maybe you heard.Among the team’s most exultant fans was Eddie Vedder, the frontman for Pearl Jam. The band may be synonymous with Seattle and the grunge-rock scene there that spawned it, but Mr. Vedder was born and raised in suburban Chicago, and is devoted to the Cubs. In 2008, he even wrote “All the Way” for the club.“Let’s Play Two: Pearl Jam Live at Wrigley Field” — the title was a favorite expression of the beloved Cubs shortstop Ernie Banks — is a blend of concert film and sports diary, chronicling Pearl Jam’s two August shows at Wrigley during the 2016 season, then capturing highlights of the team’s championship run.Directed by Danny Clinch, “Let’s Play Two” provides neither as complete a Pearl Jam concert as “Touring Band 2000” nor as illuminating a band history as Cameron Crowe’s “Pearl Jam Twenty.” But it shares a side of Mr. Vedder his fans will enjoy: the baseball aficionado who fills out a scorecard and treats Wrigley sod as holy ground. A rehearsal with other band members — the guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, the bassist Jeff Ament and the drummer Matt Cameron — atop Murphy’s Bleachers, across from the ballpark, recalls the Beatles’ rooftop concert, and their Wrigley performances of hits like “Corduroy,” “Jeremy” and “Alive” demonstrate Pearl Jam remains as potent as ever.The film’s last third toggles, somewhat awkwardly, between the shows and clips from the postseason. The music’s great, the baseball … well, we know the outcome; what will the Cubs do for an encore? With the team again back in the playoffs, the cry is now “Let’s win two.”"

But who’s quibbling? This is, after all, a Hollywood fantasy starring Mr. Cruise as Barry Seal, a real-life smuggler. An enigma with multiple chins, Mr. Seal was apparently known as El Gordo (the Fat Man), a name he may have picked up while working for a drug cartel, the C.I.A. or the Drug Enforcement Administration.It can be hard to keep tabs on the movie’s Barry, a pilot who racks up lots of miles while serving different masters. When the story opens, he is flying for T.W.A. and bored out of his evidently simple, rather dangerously restless mind. On the job, he amuses himself by flipping a few switches, jerking the controls and abruptly awakening sleeping passengers. His life takes a wild turn when a shady C.I.A. smiler, Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), makes Barry an offer to help his country or something. Before long, Barry is cozying up to Pablo Escobar and smuggling cocaine and AK-47s across the Americas. Every so often, he drops into Panama to swap packages with that country’s strongman, Manuel Noriega.ImageMr. Cruise and Alejandro Edda in “American Made.”CreditDavid James/Universal PicturesThis kind of secret world is familiar terrain for the director Doug Liman, who kick-started the “Bourne” spy franchise and directed “Fair Game,” a fictional take on some real-world intrigue involving Valerie Plame Wilson, a former C.I.A. officer, and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a onetime diplomat. “American Made,” in its self-amused tone and skittering rhythms, though, is closer to the thriller “Edge of Tomorrow,” Mr. Liman and Mr. Cruise’s movie about a man — a wrong-guy, wrong-place type — who dies to live another day only to die (repeat). Mr. Liman likes playing with Mr. Cruise’s persona, say, by messing up that famous smile, and he clearly likes letting his star strut and glide.Mr. Liman also likes stories about people with secret selves. Maybe it’s an interest he picked up from his father, Arthur L. Liman, who was the chief counsel to the Senate committee during its 1987 Iran-contra investigation. The real Mr. Seal may have played a jaw-droppingly outlandish role in that notorious affair, which, among many other byzantine turns, involved the National Security Council funneling aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The scandal encompassed a vast cast of characters that included President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A few show up in “American Made” either as fictionalized supporting characters or as themselves, smiling and slinking in archival images.Written by Gary Spinelli, “American Made” goes down easily, especially if you don’t let the historical record with its real-world stakes bother you. Mr. Cruise’s brisk, ingratiating performance — all smiles, hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat — does a lot to soften the edges. But Mr. Liman doesn’t press Mr. Cruise to dig into the character, and the actor mostly hurdles forward in a movie that never gets around to asking what makes Barry run and why. So Barry just runs and he flies and he flies some more, delivering coke and accumulating suitcases of cash that he buries and stashes in closets. (It’s hard not to think that Mr. Cruise signed on to the movie so he could do all his own flying.)ImageMr. Cruise and Sarah Wright Olsen in Doug Liman’s latest film.CreditDavid James/Universal PicturesThere’s a lot going for “American Made,” which spins like a top and has the visually beguiling, somewhat jaundiced look of a faded old Polaroid. So it’s too bad that Mr. Liman himself didn’t burrow in here as a filmmaker. The real Mr. Seal has been both the main and side attraction in many articles, books, documentaries and hard-core propaganda flicks, including some hinged on the Conspiratorial Industrial Complex which emerged during the Clinton presidency. Mr. Seal was also the subject of “Doublecrossed,” a 1991 HBO docudrama starring Dennis Hopper (which is vaguely amusing if only because Mr. Hopper played a very different coke smuggler in “Easy Rider”).“American Made” encourages and earns your laughter, although it also provokes skepticism, particularly in its attempt to portray Barry as a picaresque hero, one of those rogues tumbling and swaggering from adventure to adventure in a world that’s more corrupt than they are. After all, it asks, how bad can Barry really be, especially given the company he keeps? He doesn’t kill anyone, not exactly, and he’s nice to his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright Olsen), and their kids. A slightly downscale version of Margot Robbie’s character in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Lucy has a few tangy moments, but she and the kids mostly enhance the visual design, much like the period cars and costumes.There are moments when it feels as if Mr. Liman’s breakneck pacing is partly an attempt to distract us, to keep us from looking or thinking too hard about the grotesquely corrupt circus parading onscreen. Mr. Cruise’s performance often seems similarly calculated. Barry likes to leap before he thinks: “All this is legal?” he asks, scarcely pausing before plunging into the fray — and Mr. Cruise regularly widens his eyes in what seems to be an effort to convey Barry’s incredulity. It’s dissembling that is about as convincing as the Wolf leering in granny’s nightie. In truth, this Barry is just another ugly American, a happy hustler with a what-me-worry smile and a foot planted on another man’s throat."

Just so we’re clear: I’m describing the premise of a new movie starring Liam Neeson. What did you think?The movie is “Mark Felt — the Man Who Brought Down the White House,” and the headlines from which it was ripped are more than four decades old. The title sounds like a category error, since the White House, as of this writing, is still standing. But Mark Felt, though almost nobody knew back in the ’70s, was undoubtedly instrumental in ending the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. The associate director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate burglary, Felt entered the annals of Nixon-era scandal as Deep Throat, a pseudonym bestowed by the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward.Felt, who didn’t much like the name, identified himself as Mr. Woodward’s source in 2005. The memoir he published before his death in 2008 has been turned, by the writer and director Peter Landesman, a former journalist, into a hectic, intermittently intriguing and accidentally timely procedural thriller, with Mr. Neeson in the title role. His face as sharp as the blade of a hatchet, his brow creased with his weariness and his eyes ablaze with indignation, Mr. Neeson is a mighty presence on a small, cramped stage.The word Shakespearean often attaches itself to the Nixon administration — it’s an adjective that marks the place where political power intersects with moral instability — and “Mark Felt” tries to infuse some dramatic grandeur into what is in essence a chronicle of bureaucratic scheming. The president and most of the president’s men are rarely seen and only occasionally heard over the phone. Felt and his F.B.I. colleagues hustle in and out of offices, whisper in corridors and ride in dark, period-appropriate sedans. For the benefit of viewers who may have trouble distinguishing one white guy in a suit from another (the earnest and talented supporting cast includes Josh Lucas, Tony Goldwyn, Ike Barinholtz and Brian d’Arcy James), they often address one another by full name and title.ImageMr. Neeson with Diane Lane, who portrays Mark Felt’s wife, Audrey.CreditBob Mahoney/Sony Pictures ClassicsEven for die-hard Watergate nerds, the movie can be a tough slog. The main conflict is between Felt and his new boss, L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas), who Felt comes to believe is functioning as Nixon’s mole in the F.B.I., and who also wants to limit the bureau’s Watergate inquiries. (Gray is also the man who took the job Felt thought should have been his, and wounded pride may be among his motives.) Meanwhile, on the home front, Felt and his long-suffering, heavy-drinking wife, Audrey (Diane Lane), worry about their daughter, who has vanished into the mists of the counterculture. There is a potentially interesting tension between Felt’s professional duties and his personal life that never fully takes shape.“Mark Felt” is a sharp portrait set against a blurry background, a history lesson that won’t help you on the test. It is possible to savor the crags and shadows of Mr. Neeson’s performance without quite grasping why Mr. Landesman thinks the story is worthy of such somber, serious and sustained attention. Both the internal politics of the F.B.I. in the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover’s death and the larger political and social dramas of the late ’60s and early ’70s are invoked, but neither the national nor the institutional stakes are illuminated with sufficient clarity or force."

What unsupervised time they have is spent crashing on each other’s couches, playing video games, and identifying crushes from their yearbooks, and if Zach seems a little more handsome, a little more sociable, a little less nerdy than his friend, it’s the kind of difference in temperament that might have gone unacknowledged forever. But when Zach and Josh find themselves involved in a horrific accident that claims the life of a friend, the underlying tensions between the boys are stretched thin by guilt, panic and paranoia.The performances from the film’s young cast members are uniformly excellent, including Owen Campbell as Zach and Charlie Tahan as Josh. But the direction from Mr. Phillips is what makes “Super Dark Times” unusual. In the movie’s scenes of violence, in particular, what we hear complicates what we see, as the impact of blunt physical trauma mixes with the film’s score to suggest the psychic magnitude of accidental violence. While another movie might have leaned harder on ripped-from-the-headlines prurience, “Super Dark Times” instead aims to become a more elusive pleasure — a simple story, well told."

Yet it has a heart, too, and that adds a surprising amount of emotion to this above-average science-fiction film.Set in the past, present and future, all story lines center on Marc (Tom Hughes). His life is charted from his first breath (the movie’s opening shows an actual birth, up close) through scenes of his childhood before moving to a time near today, when he’s diagnosed with terminal cancer.Marc decides to cryo-freeze his body in hopes of later being cured, leading to his reanimation — or rebirth, if you will — in 2084. It’s no surprise that his plans have unexpected consequences.Mateo Gil, the writer and director, prizes ideas as much as action. Voice-overs have Marc expounding on memory, longing and mortality while the script probes the side effects of technology. The future scenes evoke the creepiness and claustrophobia of “Ex Machina” and, like that film, hark back to the “Frankenstein” story.The romance at the center of “Realive” keeps it from becoming too cold. Marc’s girlfriend, Naomi (Oona Chaplin), struggles with losing him, while Elizabeth (Charlotte Le Bon), his nurse in 2084, has affections and worries of her own. A montage recalling Marc and Naomi’s on-again, off-again relationship is one of several lovely moments from the exceptional cast.“Realive” occasionally sets a cautious pace, and the voice-overs can be wordy. But this film errs on the side of ambition, making such faults easy to excuse. For sure, Mr. Gil and his cast are exploring something here, and those efforts are well worth watching."

Ms. Smulders plays Allison, who went out with Adam (Mr. Long) for years before they broke up. Now she has invited him to her wedding to Aaron (Ryan Hansen), and Adam is ambivalent about it at best, unhinged at worst. He decides to attend and win her back.This movie — written, directed and edited by the actor Ryan Eggold (“The Blacklist”) and expanding on his 2011 short film of the same name — attempts to subvert genre expectations. To its credit, it offers top-notch supporting talent: John Cho plays Adam’s best friend; Kristen Schaal portrays Adam’s nervous date; and Luis Guzmán is a blue-collar worker from whom Adam receives advice and swigs of Champagne. Lea Thompson and Dana Delany are wise and luminous representatives of an older generation. And Ms. Smulders conveys notes of grace, which is no small feat given her underwritten character.The problem here is Mr. Long’s Adam, a twitchy knot of tics and self-pity. He invites our sympathy — especially when contrasted with the smarmy Aaron — but doesn’t really deserve it. We never quite discover why Allison and Adam separated, though there is a fleeting reference to Adam’s past Vicodin use. And by the time he spectacularly disrupts the reception, any emotional capital the viewer has invested is forfeit. Even a seeming twist on “The Graduate” at the climax can’t salvage the movie."

Not that we ever feel the sense of expansiveness one might expect from a movie whose plot revolves around the land. Instead, Mr. MacLachlan and his cinematographer, Andrew Reed, frame a majority of scenes — even those that take place outdoors — in contained, virtually static shots that are of no help in selling the story.What we do see of the scenery isn’t exactly breathtaking as Tracy (Amy Ryan, wonderful) and her Bible-thumping brother, Jesse (Terry Kinney), bury their father’s ashes. Jesse’s bullying tendencies are clear from their first disagreement; and when the siblings come upon three older adults camped in a field — brothers who believe they have a claim to the property — the gender dynamics soon overwhelm any other consideration.There’s something mildly sinister about the interlopers, with their ingratiating smiles, aw-shucks mannerisms and continued refusal to leave. Yet the director elects not to follow that vibration, choosing instead to back away from the story’s edgier, more unnerving possibilities in favor of something altogether more soggy and formless.Consequently, what some may see as an examination of loss and legacy, others will view as a portrait of psychological coercion: overbearing men riding roughshod over the wishes of a grieving woman.

I write about heterosexuals as well.” This fond documentary portrait, directed by Jennifer M. Kroot, makes it clear that Mr. Maupin’s mastery of assorted perspectives is his gift, evident in his masterpiece, “Tales of the City,” a love letter to San Francisco comprising multiple characters. And yet the film offers an enlightening glimpse into how the gay experience informed Mr. Maupin’s art.Mr. Maupin, 73, grew up in Raleigh, N.C., the son of a conservative, distant father. To win his approval, he served in Vietnam and even met Richard M. Nixon in the White House. Little did Nixon know that Mr. Maupin would later migrate to San Francisco, come out and encounter a broad variety of men of diverse backgrounds. Such meetings provided the invaluable insight that fed his newspaper serial “Tales of the City,” which grew into a book and eventually a groundbreaking television mini-series.Friends like Laura Linney, Ian McKellen, Amy Tan and Neil Gaiman testify to Mr. Maupin’s generosity of spirit, while the writer speaks candidly about cruising in Raleigh public parks, Fairmont Hotel trysts with Rock Hudson and the agonies of the AIDS crisis. Now Mr. Maupin is content with a husband, extolling what he calls the “logical family” of his gay peers over the “biological family” of straight society. For all his distinguished man-of-letters status, he is warm and winning company."

Based on what we’ve seen, she may not make it another week, let alone four months.Since returning from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Sarge (Kate Nowlin) swings between confusion and rage. After losing control at her coming-home party (a scene no less tense for being inevitable), she leaves her husband to stay at a secluded campground by a Minnesota lake. There she works nearly nonstop, or exercises to exhaustion, or drinks herself into a stupor to keep her demons at bay.There’s not much more plot. This drama, written by Ms. Nowlin and her husband, Remy Auberjonois, who also directed, centers on Sarge’s inner struggles. Other than a few references to her combat service and to a physical injury she sustained, the script relies on subtext and Ms. Nowlin’s expressions to convey her condition. She’s up to the task; even in the many silent moments, she’s compelling.Still, while this worthy film sidesteps clichés — there are no horrid flashbacks or emotional speeches — its spareness occasionally feels planned rather than spontaneous. After a powerful first half, later scenes offer diminishing returns.One of many recent works to study post-traumatic stress (including the documentary “Thank You for Your Service” and the novel “Preparation for the Next Life,” which both focused almost exclusively on men), “Blood Stripe” refuses to moralize or explain itself. That could seem like either a cryptic decision or an admirable stance. More than likely, it’s a good bit of both."

It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible, if unusual, proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters’s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn’t mean she wants to have sex with Louis. She wants to slide under the covers next to him, turn off the bedside lamp and chat quietly until slumber arrives, simulating the easy marital intimacy that the two of them, both long widowed, have learned to live without. Louis, startled by the idea, agrees to think about it.He and Addie are solid, respectable people of a kind who usually show up in movies to be mocked or sentimentalized. The disappointments and satisfactions they have lived through are etched on their faces, which are also the faces of two very famous movie stars — Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Viewers with long memories or heavy TCM habits will recall that 50 years ago they starred as New York newlyweds in “Barefoot in the Park.” In 1979, they reunited, with a touch more denim, in “The Electric Horseman.” The intervening decades have hardly diminished their charm or their skill, and part of the pleasure of this film, directed by Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox”), lies in the rediscovery of what wonderful actors they can be, and how good they are together.“Our Souls at Night,” adapted (by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) from Kent Haruf’s final, posthumously published novel, is too cautious and cozy to be a great movie, or even a very interesting one. The music (by Elliot Goldenthal) telegraphs the emotions too precisely, and Mr. Haruf’s wry and subtle plot is mishandled, so that there is both too much dramatic conflict and not quite enough. When Addie and Louis’s grown-up children show up — played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer — they drag in some bulky baggage. Each family has a painful event in its past, and each child represents a textbook drawing of the consequences of that pain, rather than a fully embodied, credibly suffering human being.Luckily, the stars have humanity to spare, and very little left to prove. With her careful diction and a bearing that conveys starchiness and sensuality in perfect, improbable balance, Ms. Fonda turns middle-class maturity into a bewitching form of charisma. Addie’s approach to Louis, a man she has never known that well, is driven less by neediness than by a rational understanding of what she needs. She needs to be less alone.Louis, for his part, doesn’t mind his solitude. Mr. Redford, who barely uttered a word in “All Is Lost,” at first seems prepared to match that feat here, interrupting what seem like monthlong pauses to mutter, sigh and occasionally deliver a complete sentence. He is one of the great minimalists of American cinema, an actor who can dazzle you by opening the tiniest window onto a character’s inner life. When Louis meets Addie’s young grandson, Jamie (the remarkable Iain Armitage, seen on television in “Big Little Lies” and “Young Sheldon”), the encounter awakens a long-dormant paternal instinct, and also a streak of boyishness.Addie’s companionship awakens other urges, but “Our Souls at Night” is in no hurry to confirm the hunches of the audience or the suspicions of the town’s nosier citizens. (One of these, a blowhard friend of Louis’s, is played by Bruce Dern, who once upon a time was Tom Buchanan to Mr. Redford’s Jay Gatsby). Since Addie and Louis are already sleeping together, there’s no need to rush into anything."

(The maggot mousse might be pushing it.)The movie follows Ben Reade, a chef, and Josh Evans, a researcher, then both of the Nordic Food Lab in Denmark, as they travel the world to visit cultures where insects are prepared as food. (Roberto Flore, another chef, joins the trip later.) The Nordic lab, a project initiated by Claus Meyer and René Redzepi, founders of the foodie polestar Noma, has a mission to explore “food diversity and deliciousness.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has reported that the use of insects as food may have long-term benefits for the global food supply. It also offers cooks new possibilities for tastes and textures. (If you thought using whole animals was trendy, just wait until you try dishes that use multiple developmental stages.)As they pay visits to Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Mexico and Japan, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans are effectively M.C.s on the world’s weirdest episode of “Iron Chef.” (“To be honest, I would rather a normal Camembert,” Mr. Reade confesses after sampling casu marzu, a maggot-infested cheese from Italy.)Despite their largely successful experiments, Mr. Reade and Mr. Evans express skepticism that the delicacies they’ve tried could — or should — be produced on a commercial scale.

It begins when the director, Nanfu Wang (“Hooligan Sparrow”), meets a young, itinerant homeless man named Dylan in Florida and decides to tag along with him.For Ms. Wang, who was raised in China, left that country in 2011 and now lives in New York, Dylan’s lifestyle represents a distinctly American form of freedom. (He calls it the “easiest life you can imagine.”) To her family in China, she narrates, “the idea that someone would choose to be homeless would be inconceivable.” And with a camera in tow, or sometimes in Dylan’s hands, she begins to live life his way. (“This was the first time I ate food from a garbage can,” she says in the film.) Dylan has a gift for making friends but seems to begrudge generosity, giving away money or selling food he has received.His habit of shrugging off good-will changes Ms. Wang’s attitude, a boon for anyone wondering whether her methods constitute willful naïveté, particularly with regard to Dylan’s acknowledged past substance abuse and present drinking. Is this freedom or addiction? Initially, the film’s conceit appears to rest on not acknowledging the difference.It’s unfair to reveal precisely where “I Am Another You” goes, but Ms. Wang delves further into Dylan’s past. If by the end she probably still puts too much trust in Dylan’s aphorisms, give her credit for recognizing the shortcomings of her footage and correcting course."

The losses also helped shape his determination. After graduating from Harvard Law, he was working at Columbia Records, at that time largely a bastion of middle-of-the-road acts, when he experienced an epiphany seeing Janis Joplin at the Monterey International Pop Music Festival in 1967. (After he signed her, he says, she offered to sleep with him, but he declined to mix business and pleasure.)Later discoveries included Barry Manilow, whose debut album, Mr. Davis felt, needed a hit; he recommended the song that became “Mandy,” which exploded on radio. It was Mr. Davis who masterminded “Smooth,” Carlos Santana’s 1990 smash collaboration with Rob Thomas; its album, “Supernatural,” reinvigorated Mr. Santana’s career and earned a Grammy.The film’s tragic figure is Whitney Houston, whom Mr. Davis had mentored since her adolescence. He adored her, and yet all his formidable power could not save the self-destructive singer, after years of drug use, from herself. She died hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party hosted by Mr. Davis."

That’s one of the durable truisms of “Battle of the Sexes,” a glib, enjoyable fictionalization of the 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She was 29 and one of the top female tennis players in the world. He was 55 and had been a world champion before she was born. She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100,000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big. It was a man vs. woman match made for maximum public-relations gimmickry but also a deadly serious referendum on equality on and off the court.So it was personal and it was political, which “Battle of the Sexes” gets. It was also entertainment, which is where the movie really excels. Nice and easy, it sets the players and early 1970s scene, with Billie Jean (Emma Stone) already making history and Bobby (Steve Carell) largely sidelined. She’s making waves as a player and as a champion of women’s rights, including equal pay, and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue), a frozen smiler right out of Stepford, and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly, Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay.VideoJonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris discuss a sequence from their film featuring Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough.Published OnSept. 21, 2017CreditCreditTwentieth Century FoxThe directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton make these early scenes pop, cramming characters and information into Billie Jean and Bobby’s separate realities. Billie Jean’s is livelier, more engaging, partly because there’s more at stake and because she’s surrounded by chummy, pleasurably prickly women like Rosie Casals (Natalie Morales) and Gladys Heldman (a tangy Sarah Silverman), the founder of Tennis World magazine. Together with seven other top female players, these three form a feminist revolt called the Virginia Slims tour, a women’s pro circuit that sets out to combat the gross inequalities that defined professional (open) tennis since its advent in 1968.As the sunny, sporty feminists stake their rightful claim — holding press conferences, drumming up support, winning and winning some more — a rather dark, clubbier male world comes into view. A gambler, Bobby watches Billie Jean on TV but hangs with masters of the universe, male cigar chompers and scotch swirlers who think nothing of betting away a Rolls-Royce. It looks like a lethal bore, as does Bobby’s home, where he plays with his young son under a conspicuously large and looming portrait of his wife. By the time Bobby is challenging Billie Jean to play it almost seems as if he were willing himself into the arms — or at least company — of this other woman.It takes a while for them to meet on the court, partly because Billie Jean initially turns Bobby down. So instead, he takes on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), the Australian champion who becomes the movie’s female heavy. (The real Ms. Court has played that role off screen for her views on same-sex marriage and homosexuality, which she’s branded “a lust for the flesh.”) In a well-publicized faceoff soon called the Mother’s Day Massacre, Bobby defeats Margaret, a loss that Billie Jean feels she needs to correct. It’s game on, though with complications, including Billie Jean’s revelatory attraction to another woman, a hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough).ImageSteve Carell plays Bobby Riggs to Ms. Stone’s Billie Jean King.CreditMelinda Sue Gordon/20th Century FoxMs. Faris and Mr. Dayton handle the many moving parts in Simon Beaufoy’s busy script smoothly as they toggle between intimate moments and public events, and set Billie Jean’s bedroom sighs off against Bobby’s heat-seeking braggadocio. There’s a lot to follow and a great deal to look at, including an atmospherically embellished past that turns the movie into a veritable wayback machine of amusing and amusingly unfortunate colors and choices. (The director of photography is Linus Sandgren; the production designer is Judy Becker.) There are plaid jackets and flirty minis, sideburns and shags, harvest-gold drapes and rooms perilously fogged in by cigarette smoke.A revolution can be tough to squeeze into two hours, but “Battle of the Sexes” manages it mostly by skipping along its handsome surfaces. The film repeatedly announces that there’s a lot at stake here, but without much urgency or sting. Bobby’s sexist pronouncements are outrageous, but his stunts are so absurd and self-serving that they’re hard to take seriously. And while Mr. Carell bounces and sags persuasively, the characterization is finally so soft that Bobby comes off as more needy and pathetic than threatening. The better foil and villain is a tennis promoter, Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman), one of those men who never bothers to hide his contempt for women.Billie Jean faces down Kramer at one point, speaking feminist truth to power: “It’s when we want a little bit of what you’ve got,” she says, “that’s what you can’t stand.” It’s a solid gotcha moment, but the reason it works as well as it does is its low-key realism, which underscores the absolute ordinariness of the sexism she’s calling out. Ms. Stone handles the scene exactly right, letting you see the tremor of indignation while keeping righteousness in view yet also in check. She’s unsurprisingly good and often moving, although the best thing about the performance is that Ms. Stone hasn’t been asked to play the girl who seduces us with big eyes and a smile. Billie Jean is a woman, and that’s a win."

It’s 2015, and he’s talking about the police response to calls. He admits the police are not providing the level of service they should but adds that they’re trying their best. When a robbery victim says their best isn’t good enough, he apologizes. “We need to do a better job, no doubt, and we are trying to do a better job.” By the end of the movie it seems clear that he didn’t apologize enough.Blunt and sobering, “The Force” is an account of a big-city police department in crisis. In some ways, it is a bleakly familiar story of a troubled department struggling — and failing and struggling — to right its wrongs. In 2003, Oakland and its police settled a civil-rights lawsuit and began trying to implement reforms (like improved officer training) and adhere to fundamentals, or what the city attorney called the department’s “commitment to constitutional policing.” By 2014, the year the documentary opens, the department was into its second decade of federal oversight and these basic goals remained stubbornly elusive.“The Force” doesn’t offer much on the history of the settlement, though the director, Peter Nicks, does periodically pull back to look at the bigger messy picture. For the most part, he keeps his focus trained on events as they transpire during the two often turbulent years that he roots around the department. He rides with officers, follows them onto the streets and straight into assorted testy conflagrations. He sits in on meetings, some with officers and others with politicians, recording silences and outbursts, moments of frustration and complaint. Repeatedly, he sets the efforts of individual cops against larger departmental issues.Serving as his own cinematographer, Mr. Nicks largely takes an observational approach to “The Force,” the kind that turns the camera into a persistent bystander. This particular bystander tends to have a fairly short attention span and rarely stays in one place for long, perhaps because Mr. Nicks crams years of material into a 93-minute film. He also incorporates a bit of found material, including old news reports, as well as a few extremely disturbing lethal encounters taken from police body cams. Every so often, he identifies a speaker with onscreen text or adds a time stamp; occasionally, he slides in some propulsive electronic beats.As its title suggests, “The Force” offers a look at a police department, explicitly as it is embodied by individuals and operates as an institution. There are times, especially when the other meanings of “force” emerge — and power, compulsion and violence become nakedly present — that you wish that Mr. Nicks would have stayed longer so he could dig deeper into related issues, including segregation and racism. He tends to cycle through historical markers fairly fast, as when he shows archival images of the group originally and pointedly called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which started in Oakland in 1966, partly in response to police brutality.If Mr. Nicks intended to advance an overt political agenda or partisan point of view going into his documentary, it isn’t all that evident onscreen. Certainly the documentary doesn’t come off as either for or against the police in general terms or in respect to the Oakland force. And while personalities emerge, Mr. Nicks doesn’t elevate heroes or call out villains. Instead, he makes room for various voices, from community organizers to protesters with Black Lives Matter signs to a sober young officer whose experiences underscore how tough and at times harrowing being a street cop can be. These voices are fractious, cacophonous and rarely in sync.Yet while “The Force” aims for political even-handedness, the fact that Mr. Nicks embedded with the Oakland police (rather than, say, with activists) means it emphasizes reform as a goal and a possibility. The movie may offer an incriminatory catalog of organizational failure, but it also repeatedly shows people trying to make the system work. A sobering alternative view surfaces late when Cat Brooks, with the Anti Police-Terror Group, says “We do not believe that police departments can actually be reformed.” For these activists, a triage solution like a civilian review board makes sense, even as other questions — is a police force necessary? — linger."

His “All the Real Girls” (2003) and “Snow Angels” (2007) brought acute, cleareyed, compassionate consideration to trauma and tragedy as they affect intimate relationships. Unlike those pictures, though, “Stronger” carries a separate weight. It’s also about an actual galvanic event in recent American history.“Stronger” is the story of Jeff Bauman, a resident of Chelmsford, Mass., who lost both his legs above the knee in the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon in 2013.The movie, based on Mr. Bauman’s autobiography, begins with a depiction of him as a relatively amiable screw-up. Played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who’s almost a decade older than Mr. Bauman was at the time of the events shown, the character is nevertheless a convincing man-child. After making a grisly mess of a chicken-roasting task at the Costco where he works, Jeff repairs to his local, where he drinks and curses and makes moon-eyes at his ex-girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany), a rather more directed soul who’s popped in to collect donations for her marathon run. Seizing on a notion to win her back, Jeff hand-letters a sign to brandish near the race’s finish line. He sees one of the bombers moments before the explosion that costs him his legs.VideoDavid Gordon Green narrates a sequence from the film featuring Jake Gyllenhaal as Jeff Bauman.Published OnSept. 28, 2017CreditCreditScott Garfield/Roadside Attractions,For Mr. Bauman and his milieu, Mr. Green forgoes the standard Hollywood clichés about boisterous, hard-drinking, “politically incorrect” working-class Bostonians in favor of characters who are far, far, far more boisterous, hard-drinking and “politically incorrect.” It’s kind of terrifying. For instance, Jeff’s mother, Patty, in an astounding turn by Miranda Richardson, is a slovenly, resentful, egocentric drunk who frequently prioritizes her hangovers over Jeff’s physical rehabilitation appointments. For all that, the movie itself never judges its people.“Stronger” takes more artistic risks than any other American-made “inspired by true events” picture I can recall. The emotions and situations depicted, as Jeff struggles with PTSD, his immobility, his relationship with Erin and his hometown-hero status (which he believes to be completely unearned), are raw, sometimes desperate. A scene late in the film in which Jeff begs not to be abandoned is played at such a high pitch that it flirts with, then transcends, bathos.But as it approaches the two-hour mark, the movie seems to wake to the fact that it has to live up to its title. Then “Stronger” rushes through what screenwriting gurus call the “redemptive arc,” with little concern for just how its lead character makes the life changes that enable him to face his responsibilities. And in that respect, it brings the viewer up short."

More of a poem or a city symphony than a documentary, it drifts freely, sometimes frustratingly between captured and fictionalized moments.Structurally, the movie is as loose as some of the features that Mr. Doyle has made as a cinematographer for Wong Kar-wai (“2046”). Although “Hong Kong Trilogy” is divided into three segments, each ostensibly focusing on a different generation, the sections bleed into one another. Some characters float throughout the film.The most cohesive section is the middle, between “Preschooled,” which focuses on the very young, and “Preposterous,” a non sequitur of a finale that deals, partly, with speed-dating seniors. “Preoccupied,” however, centers on young activists and depicts a snapshot of the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 pro-democracy uprising against Beijing’s political influence. Mr. Doyle films the tents that sprouted in the city and visits demonstration sites — including an organic farm and a wall inspired by John Lennon — that were also designed, the movie suggests, as spaces for thought.Despite plentiful onscreen text, the film doesn’t clarify details. (You may wonder about the fate of Vodka, a child the police haul in for littering.) The free-form assembly is consistent with this movie’s utopian worldview, but the lack of narrative discipline can be trying."

What if his paintings, with their wild colors and vibrant brush strokes, had been able to move? And what if the bullet that killed him had been fired by someone else?A long and arduous labor of love by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, the film turns van Gogh’s work into an unusual kind of biopic. Using tens of thousands of oil paintings commissioned from scores of artists, the filmmakers transform famous works of modern art into a hypnotic and beguiling cartoon. The people van Gogh rendered on canvas — the provincial French functionaries, doctors, barmaids and farmers immortalized on museum walls — are brought to uncanny life, with the voices of professional actors, some of them well known.ImageChris O’Dowd gives voice to a village postmaster in “Loving Vincent.”CreditGood Deed EntertainmentThey participate in a meandering detective story. Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), the layabout son of a village postmaster (Chris O’Dowd), is instructed by his father to deliver a letter to Vincent’s brother Theo. Armand travels to Paris and then to Auvers-sur-Oise, the northern French town where Vincent died, leaving behind contradictory memories among the people he painted in his final years. They recall a passionate, hard-working artist, but not always the tormented, suicidal genius of legend.That legend has been sustained by earlier movies, notably Vincente Minnelli’s rumbustious “Lust for Life” (with Kirk Douglas as van Gogh) and Robert Altman’s more cerebral “Vincent & Theo” (starring Tim Roth and Paul Rhys as the brothers).Vincent himself (Robert Gulaczyk) is a more elusive presence in “Loving Vincent,” since most of its action is posthumous and self-portraits make up a relatively small part of his oeuvre. There are flashbacks, but the painter is evoked mainly through the dialogue of the other characters, as if he were the Maltese Falcon.The principal mystery is the stuff of police procedural, as Armand doggedly tries to reconstruct van Gogh’s final weeks and shed light on the circumstances of his death. How miserable was he, and why? What secrets did he harbor? What enemies had he made?The questions are interesting, but not quite sufficiently dramatized to sustain “Loving Vincent” for its full length. As the story limps and drags, the viewer also becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique begins to fade. But its charm never quite wears off, for reasons summed up in the title."

This movie, “Victoria and Abdul,” directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Lee Hall, goes 1997’s “Mrs. Brown” one better in the Relevant to Contemporary Concerns department by depicting a friendship between the second-longest-reigning monarch of England and an Indian Muslim.“Based on real events … mostly,” reads a text at the movie’s opening. Queen Victoria’s first encounters with Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), an Indian functionary sent to Britain to present her with a ceremonial coin, are in comedic scenes that lampoon the pomp of her court. The material is broad, and funny. The Queen is struck by Abdul’s bearing and handsomeness, and soon enough is receiving him in private audiences and having him tutor her in Urdu. He becomes her “munshi” (teacher) and his presence in her life invigorates her. Much to the displeasure of her actual court, including her son and heir “Bertie” (a.k.a. Edward VII), played with a beard and fiercely indignant eyebrows by Eddie Izzard.In the shift from comedy to drama the movie goes wobbly. The narrative of cross-cultural understanding by way of individual affinity is a comforting but ultimately dubious one. The notion of Queen Victoria as the most progressive figure of the Victorian age is also peculiar. But this is a handsomely packaged collection of such notions, and will provide genteel entertainment to those of a mind to swallow them."

And while it affects an estimated 1 million Americans and 17 million globally, those with the condition are often dismissed as suffering from psychosomatic disorders.If nothing else, “Unrest,” by Jennifer Brea, demonstrates just how debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, can be. Ms. Brea, herself a victim, was a well-traveled Ph.D. student at Harvard who fell ill after a high fever in 2011. Along with exhaustion, she experienced loss of muscle control, the inability to speak coherently, pain, and extreme sensitivity to light and noise. Specialists at first concluded that she was dehydrated or stressed; one even suggested a delayed reaction to some childhood trauma that she might not recall.In trying to understand chronic fatigue syndrome, Ms. Brea found other sufferers online and includes some of their stories here — a young Englishwoman bedridden for eight years, a Danish girl kept against her will in a psychiatric hospital for three years. Other interviews lightly sketch the history of the medical response to the syndrome, and how utterly insufficient it seems to be. Research money is only a small fraction, the film says, of that for multiple sclerosis, a condition afflicting roughly half as many Americans.Mainly, though, “Unrest” is a video diary and, as such, is not always easy to watch. Ms. Brea bravely spares very little in showing how the disease literally leveled her life — at times leaving her crawling the floor — and strained her marriage. The film is also not vested in an upbeat ending. Rather, it powerfully insists on giving a voice to victims whose greatest challenge, apart from their symptoms, is surmounting a world of indifference."

While the movie climaxes with preparations for Gaga’s strangely spectacular 2017 Super Bowl halftime show, it mostly chronicles the artist at work in 2016 on a project that would ostensibly present her “unplugged,” so to speak.That would be her album “Joanne,” which, she tells the writer Darryl Pinckney in a disarming scene here, was inspired by an aunt who died before this artist was born as Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. (As Mr. Pinckney noted in his piece, for The Times’s T Magazine, Gaga was named in part for her.) Besides baring a heretofore-unseen part of her artistic soul, the movie finds her coping with heartache and physical ailments. While it’s possible that the director and cinematographer Chris Moukarbel is good at withholding unflattering material, Gaga comes off well, and credibly so: intelligent, an accomplished craftswoman, a well-mannered collaborator and boss.She does not inhabit the best of all possible worlds, though, for all her privilege. Because Madonna is such an obvious antecedent (and she is mentioned here, specifically with respect to the tsoris surrounding Gaga’s reputedly Madonna-derived song “Born This Way”), this movie is bound to be compared to 1991’s “Truth or Dare.” But these are very different movies, because their subjects are very different people. While Madonna was shown as the happy ringleader of a media circus, “Five Foot Two” depicts an artist and idol in a peculiar isolation. Even when other people are in the frame, Gaga often seems sadly but necessarily alone.GAGA: FIVE FOOT TWO Official Trailer (2017)CreditCreditVideo by ONE Media"

Problems arise immediately when an expected engineering position disappears in a downsizing company, leaving Sami with a temporary job as a draftsman and a visa that’s set to expire in 30 days.With a likable cast and a wholesome message about the true meaning of success, “The Tiger Hunter” might balk at the harsher details of immigrant life, but it has a generosity of spirit that lifts everyone up. Surrounding Sami with a strong support group of fellow South Asian professionals working menial jobs, the director, Lena Khan (who wrote the script with Sameer Gardezi, and whose own grandfather was a tiger hunter), knows exactly the story she wants to tell.She is helped immensely by Mr. Pudi, whose quirky performance as a television-obsessed student on the NBC comedy “Community” was a consistent delight. It also gave him an ease with ensemble work that allows him to blend with other actors instead of sucking attention. The result is an endearingly old-fashioned comedy, not just in its style and the sweetness of its plot, but also in its bright-eyed optimism about immigrant opportunities. These days, it can be hard to remember that for those who dreamed large, America once seemed like a soft place to fall."

All others are on their own.Bobbi Jene Smith had performed with the Batsheva Dance Company in Israel for a decade before deciding to return home to the United States. Early on we watch her informing Ohad Naharin, the troupe’s artistic director, of her plan. Other scenes monitor her resulting long-distance relationship with Or Schraiber, her Israeli boyfriend, who’d stayed behind.Though we’re told Ms. Smith was a star, her years with the company aren’t recapped, and there’s scant information on her intriguing back story — she grew up in Iowa before making her way to Juilliard, only to leave to follow Mr. Naharin; for a time they were lovers. No colleagues or critics are interviewed to give insights or memories or opinions. Ms. Smith reveals little about her theories or hopes or ideas.Those exclusions are apparently deliberate. The film’s director, Elvira Lind, chooses to slowly observe Ms. Smith rather than rush to understand or challenge her. That formless approach is risky, and for viewers unfamiliar with Mr. Naharin’s technique, gaga (which is the subject of another recent documentary), it’s bound to lead to confusion.Late in “Bobbi Jene,” Ms. Smith is back in Israel, performing a piece in the nude that requires her to bring herself to orgasm in front of an audience. What could seem pornographic is instead an entrancing meditation on shame and desire. Yet here again, no effort is made by Ms. Lind to engage the unacquainted. Afterward, Ms. Smith laments that in contemporary dance, a performer can create a great work but few people will see it. Documentaries like this won’t gain the art form many new followers."

His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.This is especially disappointing given the conceptual wit, visual flair and bonkers imagination of “The Lego Movie” and the sweet silliness of “The Lego Batman Movie.” “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” directed by Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan from a script with an army of credited authors, attaches itself to some of the tropes and images of Asian action cinema with sloppy affection. Mr. Chan, who voices a wise and venerable teacher in addition to playing the wise and venerable shopkeeper, doesn’t really belong to the ninja genre. But neither do the young fighters who protect the city of Ninjago from an evil four-armed warlord named Garmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux. They prefer big, noisy machines to stealth, guile and swordsmanship.The LEGO NINJAGO Movie - Trailer 2 [HD]CreditCreditVideo by Warner Bros. PicturesImageGarmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux.CreditWarner Brothers PictureGarmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.We’re also, at least in the eyes of the committee that issued this strategy memo disguised as a movie, eager to hear the voices of cool people we watch on television. Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City,” Fred Armisen of “Portlandia” and Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley” (and also “The Big Sick”) are on sidekick duty here, to no memorable effect. Ms. Jacobson’s character, the only girl in the six-ninja squad, barely rises to the level of tokenism.“She’s a girl and a ninja! Can she have it all?” a voice-over asks sardonically, trying to make a self-conscious joke at the expense of the movie’s own imaginative limitations. “You fellas need to inform yourselves on where we’re at culturally,” the lady ninja retorts. It’s a good line, but also one that the writers and directors — fellas to a man — might have taken a bit more to heart. Or maybe they did, and this is just where we’re at culturally."

Like its 2015 predecessor, this latest visit with the British agents-cum-Savile Row tailors swings for the fences without caring whose head — or torso, or dignity — is shredded en route. Even if it belongs to Sir Elton.In a plot as sloppy and extended as over-washed elastic, the singer’s cameo as the feathered-and-sequined pet of a drug-dealing villain named Poppy (Julianne Moore) is a ludicrous highlight. A homesick sociopath, Poppy has styled her Cambodian lair to resemble Eisenhower-era America, including a diner where those who displease her are churned into Hamburger Helper. (So that’s what the first film was lacking: cannibalism.)Bigger, longer and — at an interminable 141 minutes — apparently uncut, “Circle” is an emotionally sterile lark, its wounds inflicted with brolly and bullwhip, a smirk and a shrug. Obliterating all but two Kingsmen in the opening reel, the story (by the director, Matthew Vaughn, and Jane Goldman) forces the leftovers into the protective arms of their American counterparts, cowboy spies with rolling hips and code names like Tequila and Champagne. Their presence, led by a strutting Channing Tatum, lends the action a homoerotic glaze that I choose to believe is intentional.Yet in a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing. As does the cocky masculinity: This is, after all, a man’s world, and women had better get behind or beneath them if they want to survive. Sir Elton will make it just fine on his own."

Oh, it’s pretty enough, in the superficially embellished style of a perfume ad or fashion video — the gifted Finnish cinematographer Peter Flinckenberg virtually empties his bag of tricks. But it’s more lacking in substance than a yard of silk chiffon.The title refers to the psychological panic engendered by being lost in a forest (here played by the giant redwoods in Humboldt County, California), but Theresa (Kirsten Dunst) isn’t physically disoriented, just mentally unmoored. Having helped her sick mother die using a spiked spliff, Theresa, who works in a medical-marijuana dispensary, descends into a detached reverie of hallucinatory grief.

More than one person will die as she continues to mope and medicate, attired in a succession of lace-trimmed chemises. Yet no substantive conversation or hint of greater meaning pierces this gauzy void, which the Mulleavy sisters, whose fashion label is Rodarte, decorate by slapping butterflies or flowers on virtually every available surface.Filmmaking might be a natural sidestep for fashion designers — as Tom Ford has twice proven, though he had the foresight to use strong novels as building blocks — but “Woodshock” is a painterly bore. At their most basic level, movies are supposed to actually move; this one is as becalmed as its perpetually high heroine."

Claude Lanzmann’s “Shoah” spreads its interviews out over more than nine hours, implicitly acknowledging the limitations of making a Holocaust film even as it serves as a record of survivors’ memories. Joshua Oppenheimer’s “The Act of Killing” goes for the throat: The director shows the former members of Indonesian death squads re-enacting their crimes.In considering the case of Hissène Habré (also known as Hissein), who as president of Chad from 1982 to 1990 led a murderous, dictatorial government, “Hissein Habré, a Chadian Tragedy” doesn’t go to any extremes. It’s more of a document than a documentary; calling it cinema seems like an error of categorization.Although the director, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (“A Screaming Man”), who was raised in Chad but left during Mr. Habré’s rule and now lives in France, provides a voice-over, his authorial presence is minimal. The bulk of the film consists of survivors of Mr. Habré’s reign recounting their arrests and what happened to them afterward. The interviews can be dry and formal (names, ages and dates of arrest). Many victims are still suffering the physical tolls of torture.Mr. Habré was arrested in 2013 in Senegal, where he was living in exile, and the movie was first shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2016, shortly before Mr. Habré was convicted of war crimes. That foreknowledge provides some context for the interviews, most of which are conducted by Clément Abaïfouta, the leader of a group that pressed for Mr. Habré’s prosecution.The tensest scene involves an effort by Mr. Abaïfouta to broker a reconciliation. Mr. Abaïfouta sits with a man who was arrested by Mr. Habré’s political police force, and with the policeman the former prisoner says arrested and tortured him. Then Mr. Abaïfouta asks the victim if it’s possible to offer forgiveness. The former Habré police force member attempts to play down his actions (“I was a subordinate,” he says), and likens himself to a dog who was trained to attack.In response, the victim urges him to “be a man” — not a dog — “at all times.”"

We watch as Gina fixates with rose-colored glasses on a new partner, this time a skeezy Parisian bartender, Jérôme (also played by Mr. Bonnard), whose acquiescence to a one-night stand in no way prepares him for the onslaught of Gina’s obsession.But even as Gina’s behavior dips past manic pixie dream girl to merely manic, the director never deviates from the detached tone of his prologue. Though both Ms. Burdge and Mr. Bonnard offer vulnerably world-weary performances, Mr. Silver has made a movie about obsession that never delves deeper than infatuation.Thematically shallow but stylistically rich, “Thirst Street” is best enjoyed with a hint of its heroine’s willfully superficial vision. For an audience with an eye for their own pleasure, “Thirst Street” offers a parade of beautiful light, beautiful (women’s) bodies, and beautiful surfaces — no need to worry about what’s inside."

Past, present and future share visual and narrative space as the histories of poisons, eugenics, home-loan guidelines and forensic science coalesce like iron filings around a magnet. The aesthetic audacity alone is intriguing; combined with Maureen Jones’s icily robotic narration and Dan Deacon’s eerie electronic score, the effect is somewhere between confounding and mesmerizing.From within a variety of environments — including Frances Glessner Lee’s meticulously constructed miniature dioramas of unexplained deaths — Mr. Anthony shines as much light on racist urban planning as on ratty behavior. Lessons on residential segregation slip in quietly among oddball portraits of city residents who harbor, hunt or otherwise relate to the creatures. A young couple laboriously rat-proofs a living room so their pets can play, and two men go “rat-fishing” using lines baited with turkey meat and peanut butter. With a side helping of Louisville Slugger.“It ain’t never been a rat problem in Baltimore; it’s always been a people problem,” says Harold Edmond, a wry exterminator and philosopher-poet. And as successive layers of street maps are projected onscreen, the relationship between infestation and economic inequity is clear: Rats thrive, according to Mr. Edmond, where people have no dreams. Unspoken is the suggestion that those aspirations have been more effectively eradicated than any vermin."

The film was shot on location in the Dominican Republic’s Najayo and La Victoria prisons, where the stifling claustrophobia of those settings infuses every frame.Julián (the Haitian-Dominican actor and filmmaker Jean Jean), who has been convicted of theft, is shorn of his resplendent dreadlocks when he is sent to Najayo, where he quickly learns the sign language — “woodpecking” — that the inmates employ to communicate and flirt from afar with the female inmates at an adjacent penitentiary.

When Julián himself catches Yanelly’s eye, and she his, tensions escalate between Julián and Manaury, and the men are relocated to the even more oppressive La Victoria. There, a newly freed Yanelly visits as passions and a prison riot erupt.The lean handsomeness and quiet authority of Mr. Jean is a perfect complement to Ms. Rodríguez’s passionate Yanelly, while the locations — and the presence of actual inmates — underscore the harsh boundaries the lovers struggle against.

It’s a fair enough question, not least because Brad is played by Ben Stiller, a frighteningly high-strung performer even at his mellowest. Mr. Stiller, lean as a greyhound and gray around the temples, occupies the volatile middle ground between decent fellow and abrasive jerk, between adequacy and failure. He’s a regular guy perpetually threatening to turn into that guy, embarrassing the rest of us by association.In “Brad’s Status,” Mike White’s astute, cringy and ultimately kindhearted new film, Mr. Stiller undergoes a midlife crisis that has less to do with restlessness or lust than with a dreadful loss of perspective. Brad, who runs a small nonprofit, lives in a handsome Craftsman-style house on a leafy Sacramento block. His wife, Melanie (Jenna Fischer), who works in state government, is patient and devoted. Troy (Austin Abrams), a rising high school senior, is an excellent student, a gifted musician and an all-around good kid. Brad lives in a soft pocket of the American dream. He should be counting his blessings, or at least checking his privilege.Instead, he dreams of the greener grass where his old college pals frolic, consumed with envy for their gilded, fast-track lives. As he and Troy prepare to head east for a tour of potential colleges — Brad, who went to Tufts, is amazed to learn that his son is Harvard material — he is seized by anxieties that quickly migrate from the practical to the existential. The question of whether he and Melanie will have enough money for Troy’s tuition gives way to a resentful reckoning with his peers. How come he doesn’t have as much as they do?These four men occupy a prime parcel of professional, personal and actual real estate. Nick (Mr. White), is a Hollywood director whose house has recently been featured on the cover of a glossy shelter rag. Jason (Luke Wilson) is a hedge-fund mogul with a bevy of blond kids and a private jet. Billy (Jemaine Clement), having made a fortune in tech, now lives in polyamorous retirement on a beach in Maui. Craig (Michael Sheen) has parlayed a political career into best-selling authorship and television celebrity.What do they have that Brad lacks? Where did he go wrong? Why does he only rate a worthless silver airline rewards card, instead of gold or platinum? He ruminates on these and related matters in long passages of voice-over narration, brought back to reality by the ringing of his cellphone or the needs of his son.Brad also reconnects with his old friends — three of the four, at least — who drop hints that they may have problems of their own. Everybody does. And Mr. White is committed to giving everyone a fair hearing. He specializes in exquisitely awkward scenes made more so by his evenhanded sympathy. In one especially acute moment, Brad unburdens himself to a Harvard undergraduate named Ananya (Shazi Raja) who is a friend of Troy’s from back home. Rather than singing harmony with Brad’s white man’s blues, she rebukes him for his unthinking white male entitlement. “You’re 50 years old and you still think the world was made for you,” she marvels.She has a point. So does he. His angst is real, as are the gradations of social hierarchy that cause it. But in the bigger picture, his misery is trivial. Mr. White could easily have loaded the satiric dice, emphasizing Brad’s Gen-X self-absorption or Ananya’s millennial self-righteousness, but he suspends judgment, leaving the viewer hanging in an exquisitely uncomfortable limbo. What are we supposed to think? We’re supposed to think for ourselves.And “Brad’s Status” at its best is genuinely thought-provoking. As a writer, television creator and director — his résumé includes “Beatriz at Dinner,” “Year of the Dog” and the HBO series “Enlightened” — Mr. White has honed a comic sensibility that avoids cruelty and minimizes exaggeration. He is attuned to the political implications of individual behavior and also to those aspects of experience that can’t be politicized. His characters are bundles of contradictory impulses and qualities. They are admirable and awful, full of idealism and full of themselves, weird and entirely familiar.Sometimes you might wish he pushed them harder. “Brad’s Status,” a worthy addition to the burgeoning genre of empty-nest movies, smooths more feathers than it ruffles. In spite of Mr. Stiller’s displays of doubt and discomfort, the movie protects him from humiliation and finds a safe space for Brad’s bruised ego. There is something a little disappointing about this, but also something honest, since the movie’s message is that what looks like disappointment should be embraced as the only real happiness there is."

We know his type pretty well. He possesses all the necessary skills but lacks the discipline that his employers supposedly demand. Conventional wisdom in his profession says that it’s never personal, but for a guy like Rapp it’s always personal. He may have a job to do, but he is also driven by longstanding grudges and unsettled scores. I’m not saying he’s a cliché, but at the end of the day, it is what it is.ImageMichael Keaton plays the “grizzled veteran” Stan Hurley.CreditChristian Black/LionsgateThe movie, directed by Michael Cuesta from a script by a team of blue-chip writers (Stephen Schiff and Michael Finch are credited, along with Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz), shows more skill than personality. There are fights and chases, punctuated by tense meetings and bouts of intense laptop and cellphone use. We hop from one camera-friendly hot spot to another before settling in Rome for the final round of fights and chases.Since this is in effect an origin story, a certain amount of time needs to be spent on explaining how Rapp arrived at his vocation and showing how he was trained in it. The explaining is perfunctory: Terrorists killed his fiancée on a beach in Ibiza the day he proposed to her. The training is more elaborate, since it involves Michael Keaton.Twenty-five years post-“Batman,” Mr. Keaton has re-emerged as the go-to wise, grizzled veteran of whatever you need him to be a wise, grizzled veteran of: car racing (“Need for Speed”); the newspaper business (“Spotlight”); Hollywood itself (“Birdman”). Here he plays Stan Hurley, who is putting together a top-secret black-ops program called Orion. Mitch, who had been planning a freelance revenge on his girl’s killer, has been recruited by the deputy C.I.A. director, Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan), who sees a perfect fit between the young hothead and the grizzled veteran.She’s not wrong. There is some first-rate hardass mentoring from Hurley and some spirited defiance from Rapp against a backdrop of rogue Iranian nuclear shenanigans. There are also some perhaps not-fully-professional glances exchanged between Rapp and Annika (Shiva Negar), a colleague with a shadowy back story. In a Ludlumesque switcheroo, the geopolitical tensions are a bit of a red herring. The real enemy is a fellow known as Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), whose mentor Hurley used to be.It is personal, then. It’s also decent fun, in the leathery, businesslike, self-satisfied manner of this kind of movie, which soothes the hurt places in the male ego with sentiment strategically disguised as toughness. So far there are 16 Mitch Rapp novels in print — the series, begun by Vince Flynn, has been kept going by Kyle Mills after Mr. Flynn’s death — and therefore plenty more of this kind of work to be done."

And yet, for some, its atmosphere and intriguing performances will prove worthy of the outing.Babel Johnson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), called Babs, is a former Philadelphia cop who had a drug problem. Now clean, he is living in New Jersey, dealing with corrupt police brass and getting a new partner, Paddy Sheehan (Christopher McDonald), an affable gambling addict whose wife (Jennifer Ehle), a TV news anchor, strikes sexual sparks with Babs.But Babs is mainly on a mission to regain the trust of his ex, Savannah (Heather Graham), and daughter, Amy (Celeste O’Connor), who want no part of him. Savannah cavorts in seedy bars with Surfer Girl (Reyna de Courcy), a drug runner skimming goods that she hopes will buy her a new life in Hawaii. When Surfer Girl runs afoul of her suppliers, events take a homicidal turn as a coastal hurricane brews.As the haunted Babs, Mr. Akinnuoye-Agbaje has an imposing physicality and understated nobility, while Ms. Graham fleshes out the resolute if underwritten Savannah. (Ms. Graham keeps improving, and her role lends a welcome grit to her fresh-scrubbed image.) And Barry Markowitz’s cinematography nicely captures a desolate outpost of sea and sin. But as cinematic excursions go, “Wetlands,” the feature debut of its writer-director, Emanuele Della Valle, is more deserving of a day trip than a long-term stay."

With the help of her longtime collaborator and co-writer, Peter Kjenaas, and the first-time director Taron Lexton, Ms. Cartwright creates a Felliniesque fantasy of her own.In the movie, Lucy (Ksenia Solo) is a sheltered 20-year-old who inherited her mother’s idealistic view of romance and appreciation of feel-good movies. After her mother (Maria Bello) falls ill, Lucy finds solace at a festival of Fellini films and discovers movies with dark endings and sexual scenes that she had never seen before. She resolves to find the man of her cinematic dreams in Italy.Lucy, whose wide-eyed naïveté is modeled after Giulietta Masina’s character in “La Strada,” isn’t the only reference to Fellini’s movies. “In Search of Fellini” is overflowing with characters, locations and visual cues to the director’s classics, like “La Dolce Vita,” “8 ½” and “Nights of Cabiria.” Fans who refer to Fellini as Il Maestro may delight in these references, but several cues and cameos are followed by a scene or poster of the cited movie, so as not to exclude the rest of the audience.Fellini used nostalgia to point out something about ourselves; Mr. Lexton uses it to remind us of Fellini’s films. The movie can shift unevenly from effusive love letter to travel lust to sentimental moment, but that doesn’t break the fantasy."

But for Manolo Blahnik, maker of some of the most sublime women’s footwear of the past four decades, she drops the lenses and lets her eyes, and feelings, show.Mr. Blahnik inspires this warmth by dint of his shoes and also his character, which is eccentrically patrician, starry eyed, elegant. (He wears the hell out of a lilac suit.) He’s a man who describes wisteria — the word, but presumably also the plant — as “so Olympic, it’s so hedonistic in a way.”But this film, directed by the fashion writer and editor Michael Roberts, doesn’t aspire beyond embrace. It rushes through Mr. Blahnik’s biography, dwelling on pop-culture moments and blandly ecstatic celebrity testimonials (not counting the uproarious André Leon Talley, who insists Mr. Blahnik is “up there with Baudelaire”). It also leans heavily at times on recreated footage of Mr. Blahnik’s childhood, as well as on a bizarre scene imagining a 1930s African society party in which a white woman emerges from a gorilla costume.There is little accounting of his inner life, or for that matter of his creative gifts, which are quite exquisite. And though there are some cleverly conceived but blindingly lighted scenes of Blahnik shoes in nature, or nestled amid sculpture or architecture, there is nothing systematic to the way the shoes are discussed or filmed. In a scene puzzlingly late in the film, Mr. Blahnik, who apparently still makes samples by hand, walks through his factory and finesses a sensuous heel out of a stump of wood. More of that would have made this confection about a radiant man into something sturdier."

Mr. Ford had gone there after a dispute over a repair and confronted Mr. Reilly about an insult that was said to have been made earlier to Mr. Ford’s mother. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Reilly, a decision that staggered Mr. Ford’s loved ones.Though questions of race and justice are raised, Yance Ford more often examines how he and the rest of his middle-class family dealt, or refused to deal, with the tragedy. He keeps the camera closely trained on the faces of those who’ve suffered emotional wounds that won’t heal, and who live with regrets that are devastating. That includes himself.The effect is intense and elegiac, even as the pace veers toward the overly deliberate, and as Mr. Reilly and some essential witnesses aren’t interviewed or approached by the filmmaker; no explanation for this omission is given.Were “Strong Island” a strict procedural, that exclusion would be more glaring. Yet this potent film gives equal weight to complex emotions as well as bare facts. In the same way, it’s not just the story of a man’s death, but also a study of the aftermath."

He has even been credited with inventing the concept of the midnight movie at Chelsea’s long-gone Elgin Theater, which he ran. Alas, the self-financed “Alina,” his first fiction feature as a director, looks like the work of someone just starting out.This fish-out-of-water story goes to predictable places in unconvincing ways. Alina (Darya Ekamasova), a Russian with a passion for photography, travels to New York seeking her father, whom she’s never met. (Not wanting to alarm her mother, she pretends she’s going to Cuba.)Alina soon discovers the city is full of sharks. She moves in with an old friend (Anna Vlads) and her two roommates, not realizing that when they bring her to a party, they expect her to have sex with the rich hosts. When she goes to work for a nightclub owner (Grisha Reydler) who has helped with her search, she is slow to realize that the job involves more than serving champagne.Although the internet and cellphones exist in the movie, there’s a dated quality to the premise. Even if Alina’s only clue is an old photograph of a man who may be her father, tracking down the owners of the building in the photo — which has a visible address — seems like a task for search engines. And if you were to go the route of simply finding someone who knows someone, repeatedly, as Alina does, it would probably involve less coincidence."

Maybe the writer and director, Damian Harris, has a dossier.The wedding in question is the fifth try for Eve Wilde (Glenn Close, looking bored to the point of embalmed), an over-the-hill film star and Laurence’s ex-wife. Her latest intended is a writer named Harold (Patrick Stewart, mugging beneath a horrendously permed wig), and he and several generations of the couple’s families and hangers-on have convened at Eve’s lavish New York estate for the nuptials. Sex and drugs and formulaic frolicking ensue.With too many characters to keep track of, never mind care about, the viewer is reduced to counting the movie’s many irritants. There’s the virtually nonstop, banal music; the bleating narration of a family member (Grace Van Patten), who’s making a documentary; the inane dialogue (“Love is in the air!”). While Harold gets it on with a woman seemingly young enough to have missed the fall of the Berlin Wall (in one of the film’s more distasteful digressions), Laurence — all head-to-toe cream and fey wrist-flicking — is such a parody he belongs in a mockumentary about classical actors.The soullessness of the enterprise is staggering. Making clichéd, cynical gestures toward romance, Mr. Harris (whose last feature was almost a decade ago) tortured me for a full 96 minutes. You’re welcome."

Part novelty act and part religious totem, the sisters — beautiful to look at and heavenly to listen to — are a perceived miracle that everyone wants to touch, their bodies constantly violated by the sick and the searching.Yet even before a doctor offers to separate them, the sisters are pulling apart, their diverging desires expressed in a delicate vocabulary of gestures and glances. The performances of the young actors who play them (actual twins, though not conjoined) are the real miracles here, each one creating a distinct personality. A scene where Daisy is being seduced by a lizardlike agent (Gaetano Bruno) while Viola cringes in disgust is as funny as it is horrifying.Sensitively and with subtle switches in tone, Nicola Guaglianone’s screenplay builds flesh, faith and family into a multi-walled prison. Catchy songs and a moody, woodwind-heavy score by Enzo Avitabile enrich a setting steeped in poverty, corruption and a perverse Catholicism. In this near-Gothic environment, even the heavy skies, trash-strewn beaches and weary roadside prostitutes seem appealingly strange and more than a little magical.“I’ve tried to balance attraction and repulsion in each frame I have built for the film,” the director says in the press notes. I would say he has more than succeeded."

Here the movie is resourcefully clever without showing off about it; for instance, depicting Beatriz’s possible future self dressed a little more stylishly than in reality. There is gentle comedy here, and a real rooting interest deriving from Ms. Zhang’s committed, never-a-false-note performance. The film’s unusual perspective makes it a distinctive and potentially enriching experience."

She has made an engrossing, dynamically shot movie that moves with real fluidity and complexity. Yet she also succumbs to familiar ideological pitfalls. The standard complaints about cultural appropriation, point of view and the ethics of aestheticizing war all apply.The movie’s source is Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir of her childhood under the Khmer Rouge, which captured Phnom Penh when she was 5 and ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Ms. Jolie announces her respect for the material almost immediately by putting the titles in Khmer as well as in English, only to undercut that gesture with a slick, scene-setting montage, glibly scored to the Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil.” The sequence juxtaposes footage of Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and others with imagery of the United States’ bombing raids in Cambodia.Still, the stab at an energetic overture isn’t totally unwelcome, since the previous war movies Ms. Jolie directed — “In the Land of Blood and Honey” (2011) and “Unbroken” (2014) — were both earnest slogs. “First They Killed My Father” is never that.VideoAngelina Jolie narrates a scene from her film.Published OnSept. 13, 2017CreditCreditNetflixThe story proper begins in Phnom Penh, where the young Loung (Sreymoch Sareum) lives comfortably with her middle-class family, which is loyal to the outgoing government. Her father (Kompheak Phoeung) is a captain in the military police. A moment in which Loung reaches for the sky, trying to touch a helicopter overhead, recalls Steven Spielberg’s “Empire of the Sun,” a movie that, with its child’s-eye view of war as a time of horror and wonder, might well have served as a template.The screenplay — Ms. Jolie and Ms. Ung are credited as a writing team — manages the tricky task of providing enough information to push the film along while only rarely straying beyond what a child might comprehend. Loung soon discovers that she and her family, with whom she’s been forced to evacuate the capital, won’t be returning home after the promised three days. She learns that she will work in service of Angkar (the name for the Khmer Rouge leadership); surrender personal property (foreign goods, in particular, are seen as symbols of an imperialist agenda); and be separated piecemeal from her parents and siblings.Ms. Jolie sparked an outcry for a casting process that, as recounted in a Vanity Fair interview, struck many as exploitative. The article said that Ms. Jolie was looking for children who had experienced hardship, and that for the lead role, the casting directors created a game in which children would steal money off a table and then lie when caught. (Ms. Jolie said her quotations were taken out of context; Vanity Fair stood by the story.) Whatever her process, she has found an expressive star in Ms. Sareum, who carries much of the film without words.Whether the movie’s perspective is truly Loung’s is another matter. Ms. Jolie, working with the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, shoots the character’s dream sequences in garish, supersaturated colors. The elaborate Steadicam shots and pervasive images of light streaming through foliage seem incongruously punch-drunk for a film that concerns mass starvation and death. Even a moment in which children training to fight stand completely still in a murky river during a downpour seems conceived more for its compositional possibilities than dramatic effect. Viewers familiar with the work of one of the producers, Rithy Panh, a director who has made movies about his own youth under the Khmer Rouge (including “The Missing Picture”), may find the rampant prettification poorly considered.The most simultaneously stunning and appalling shot shows a high-angle view of Loung treading carefully through a mine-strewn forest as another woman runs through it — only to step on a mine and be killed. The moment captures everything that’s right and wrong with “First They Killed My Father”: It is gorgeous and suspenseful, and it rushes heedlessly into dangerous terrain."

The work of home improvement, of literal homemaking, you might say, falls to the young wife. Her husband, who has been around longer than she has, is absorbed in his work. He’s a poet, and the torment of creation distracts him from her needs, at times rendering him all but oblivious to her presence. Neither partner is given a name. They are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. The movie is called “Mother!” The first line of dialogue is “Baby?”The missus walks around in her nightgown, lonely and confused, especially when her hubby starts bringing home guests. “Who are these people?” she asks him. She never receives an adequate answer — they are big fans of the poet’s work, though — and for a while her bewilderment is ours as well. But we, at least, are in a position to analyze the abundantly available clues and figure out who everybody is, the poet and his lady included. Or if not quite who they are, then at least what they represent. Because though this extravagant conversation piece of a movie, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, feints toward psychological thriller territory and spends a delicious half-hour or so in the realm of domestic farce, it plants its flag defiantly on the wind-swept peak of religious (and ecological) allegory.I don’t mean this in the vague, Superman-is-really-a-messiah-figure term paper sense of the word. At a certain point — it will vary according to your Sunday school attendance or what you remember from freshman English — you will find yourself in possession of the key to the analogical storage room where the Real Meaning resides. Up until that point, you might have thought this was a marital melodrama set in a nightmarish version of a ’50s academic marriage. When Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, you might mistake “Mother!” for a savage, scrambled “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” adaptation. But then, sometime between the first violent death and the collapse of the kitchen sink, you realize that something else is going on.Here I must confess a different kind of puzzlement. Is there such a thing as interpretive spoiler? Is it wrong to reveal a movie’s conceit, rather than elements of its story? Ordinarily, such questions would be absurd, but Mr. Aronofsky ingeniously braids his movie’s hermeneutic structure into its plot, making it hard to say what it’s about without revealing what happens. All of the suspense and most of the fun in “Mother!” — and don’t listen to anyone who natters on about how intense or disturbing it is; it’s a hoot! — has to do with the elaboration and execution of a central idea.Once you grasp that idea, you are left wondering just how far Mr. Aronofsky will go with it. The answer is all the way and then some — from Genesis to Revelation and back again. The house is referred to early in the film as “paradise”; Ms. Lawrence refers to a relatively minor mess as an “apocalypse.” These are more teasers than jokes, and the punch lines arrive with mesmerizing literalness. Holy Eucharist, Batman!VideoDarren Aronofsky narrates a sequence from his film starring Jennifer Lawrence.Published OnSept. 14, 2017CreditCreditNiko Tavernise/Paramount PicturesNot that Mr. Aronofsky follows any known doctrinal path, any more than he did in “Noah,” which upset some believers by taking liberties with its scriptural source. “Mother!” casts a wider net, gathering influences from cinema — Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Gaspar Noé — from literature and, most strikingly, from painting. Mr. Aronofsky and his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, conduct a master class in light, shadow and Renaissance art. Ms. Lawrence glows like an Italian Madonna, while the deep lines in Mr. Bardem’s face and the sorrowful cast of his eyes suggest El Greco. The infernal chaos of the climactic sequences are pure Hieronymus Bosch, updated for the age of Kristen Wiig and automatic weaponry.It falls to the actors to endow this highly symbolic, pictorially overloaded environment with a sense of human reality — with flesh and blood and feeling. Mr. Bardem, alpha male and omega man, is the kind of actor who can endow an abstraction with gravity and tenderness. (He did pretty much that in “No Country for Old Men.”) The enigmatic nature of his character in “Mother!” allows him to relax, to be playful and charismatic, and to disappear. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer bring a jolt of shtick and a whisper of camp, qualities that you may miss terribly when they depart.Ms. Lawrence, for her part, bears an impossible burden. In dramatic terms, she is a passive, reactive protagonist, a cipher and, in the strict sense of the word, an icon. Called upon to embody all of womankind — and a lot else besides — she is denied the chance to be human, and her blankness empties the film of emotional power.What it has, instead, is extravagant sensation and churning intellectual energy. Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing, a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be, there is something missing — an element of strangeness, of difficulty, of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness.On the other hand, “Mother!” made me laugh harder and more frequently than just about any other movie I’ve seen this year. I don’t say this derisively. Mr. Aronofsky’s visual wit and dexterous, disciplined camera movements create frissons of comic terror. His gift for escalation — evident in the marvelous crescendo of frenzied action that occupies most of the movie’s second half — may be unmatched in his generation of filmmakers.It’s not clear that his gifts match his ambitions. He wants to be Kubrick, but maybe what we need is a new Blake Edwards. At a time when film comedy is mostly a verbal and psychical affair — the domain of writers and clowns — there is a dearth of funny directors with Mr. Aronofsky’s sophisticated chops. If he didn’t take himself so seriously, he could be a great comic filmmaker. But maybe “Mother!” proves that he already is."

More than 50,000 souls are said to have flowed through its marble grandeur, inaugurating what has been an intimate, mutually sustaining union between the public and its library. In his magnificent new documentary “Ex Libris: The New York Public Library,” Frederick Wiseman takes his camera into those same halls as well as into more humble city branches. He sweeps into atriums and down corridors, pauses in reading and meeting rooms, and lays bare this complex, glorious organism that is the democratic ideal incarnate.It is an ideal that emerges piecemeal in a movie that starts with a declaration of independent thinking and closes on an exultant and deeply moving self-reflexive note. In between, the practical and the philosophical meet head on in “Ex Libris” as discussions about budget concerns and the public good swirl amid orders for building renovations and larger questions about the digital divide. Places come into view as do people who read, deliberate and declaim uptown and down, largely in Manhattan though also in the Bronx. (Mr. Wiseman isn’t in the information business, so it seems worth mentioning that there are three separate library systems in the city, including the Queens Library and the Brooklyn Public Library.)ImageReading room in the New York Public Library.CreditZipporah FilmsOver many decades and movies, Mr. Wiseman’s great subject has been institutions, places that he once loosely defined as having “certain kinds of geographical limitations and where at least some of the people have well-established roles.” He’s particularly sensitive to the ebb and flow of humans inside these places and, unsurprisingly, given this documentary’s focus, he seems especially attentive here to the sounds of that flow. (As usual, Mr. Wiseman recorded the movie’s sound and is its editor.) In one scene, the poet Yusef Komunyakaa’s words bounce off hard walls; elsewhere, only the rustling of turning manuscript pages disturbs a room’s tranquillity.A master dialectician, Mr. Wiseman incessantly shifts in “Ex Libris” between quiet and noise, macro and micro, patrons and administrators. A shot of the main branch’s exterior accompanied by the city’s cacophonous din is answered by a shot of its hushed and vaulted entranceway. With rigor and clarity, Mr. Wiseman, who refrains from using voice-over, situates you in specific locations using street signs (Library Way and Fifth Avenue) as well as the names of buildings and branches, like that of the tiny Macomb’s Bridge Library at Harlem River Houses. Over time, as he skips across New York, the branches start to fit together as building blocks of the larger institution.This incremental process is echoed by Mr. Wiseman’s own aggregate method, which gathers details ranging from the prosaic to the peculiar for his evolving mosaiclike picture. “The Gutenberg bible is temporarily unavailable for viewing,” says a librarian working on the telephone research desk. “A unicorn is actually an imaginary animal,” says another with a poker face and blissful patience. Sometimes the speakers are downright glittering: Patti Smith holds forth on one occasion and, on another, Elvis Costello introduces a charming video clip of his father, a musician, Ross McManus, singing the progressive anthem “If I Had a Hammer.” (“I’d hammer out the love between my brothers and my sisters/All over this land.”)ImageFrederick Wiseman, director of “Ex Libris.” Mr. Wiseman’s great subject has been institutions.CreditErik Madigan Heck/Zipporah FilmsThere are more than 90 library branches in New York, and Mr. Wiseman has said that he visited about a dozen during the 12 weeks in 2015 that he shot this movie. Again and again, though, he returns to the main branch, now formally called the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. A private equity executive, Mr. Schwarzman donated $100 million to the New York Public Library in 2008, effectively buying the right to have his name on the main branch alongside quotations from immortals like Jorge Luis Borges and Thomas Jefferson. Big money is a thread running through the movie, including in meetings with Anthony W. Marx, the president of the library, and other senior staff members.For all his access, Mr. Wiseman doesn’t overtly address the Library’s Central Library Plan, a controversial proposal initiated in 2008 that would have involved a radical redesign and new focus — away from research to circulation — for the main branch. Among other goals, the library was seeking to make its flagship more public friendly, a fuzzy term that can serve as a fig leaf for anti-intellectualism. Alarmed that the library was discarding its mission, scholars composed letters that the likes of Salman Rushdie signed, and committees and lawsuits ensued. The expensive plan was scuttled in 2014.If Mr. Wiseman doesn’t openly engage with the debate over the Central Library Plan many of the issues that emerged during that dispute nonetheless reverberate over the course of the documentary, including the overarching question of the library’s mission. Throughout “Ex Libris” both senior staff members and branch librarians speak about serving the public, service that has long extended beyond checking out physical books. In scene after scene, you are reminded that libraries serve as study centers, neighborhood hubs, babysitters and homeless shelters. They offer lectures and concerts, but also provide immigrant services, job fairs and internet service, including through a program that lets users without home access borrow mobile hot spots.Mr. Wiseman never states outright what the library’s mission is; he doesn’t have to. It’s as clear as the recitations from the Declaration of Independence in one scene and in a passionate discussion of a racist textbook’s misrepresentation of the American slave trade in another. It is a soaring, Utopian mission in a documentary that builds with intellectual force and deep emotion as it shows, again and again, citizens — interested, questioning, seeking — joining together to listen to one another and to learn from one another. In “Ex Libris,” democracy is alive and in the hands of a forceful advocate and brilliant filmmaker, which helps make this one of the greatest movies of Mr. Wiseman’s extraordinary career and one of his most thrilling."

The movie bears a superficial resemblance visually and in its coming-of-age narrative to “George Washington” (directed by David Gordon Green, an executive producer here) and “Moonlight,” but it never finds the right balance between the suggestive and the concrete.Mr. Abbasi, raised in Arkansas after his family immigrated from Pakistan, extensively researched gang life in the region, and the resulting specificity gives the movie what charge it has. The film follows Dayveon (Devin Blackmon), a 13-year-old in rural Arkansas. Mourning his brother’s shooting death — which we’re told has driven his mother to madness — he lives with his sister, Kim (Chasity Moore), and her boyfriend, Bryan (Dontrell Bright).Shortly after the movie opens, a group of Bloods assault Dayveon as part of an initiation rite. “I got jumped in,” he tells Bryan, who isn’t thrilled. Bryan was close with Dayveon’s brother and, at one point, openly offers to be a brother figure to him. (Dayveon doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve.) Dayveon gets a more rude awakening to gang life when he covers up a license plate to help his comrades flee a robbery.With dialogue that doesn’t make concessions to clear exposition, the movie hints at several possible futures for Dayveon: a stable life with his family; afternoons skipping rocks with a friend (Kordell Johnson), who is also a new gang member; more robberies. But the diffuse filmmaking style muffles the story’s power."

Several of those are full of energy, even when delivered by the lone actor in this film adaptation of a one-man play.Aaron Davidman, the writer and performer, toured with the theatrical show for years before adapting it to the screen. In the film, he embodies more than a dozen men and women affected by decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.Perhaps because of the show’s stage pedigree, Mr. Davidman emphasizes large emotions at the expense of smaller moments, a choice that works best in scenes like one in which a rabbi describes his fury with those he believes have warped his religion or when a Palestinian explains his people’s long-term commitment to overcoming what he sees as Israeli oppression. Dylan Kussman, the director, places Mr. Davidman alternately in front of an audience, in an empty theater and in a desert, and through sharp edits and angles fosters a sense of immediacy.Still, there’s no getting around that this is a filmed version of a one-person play, with all the shortcomings inherent in such a project, and without the magic that live performance can generate. Sometimes the effort here is more admirable than exciting.Mr. Davidman ends up not far from where he begins — his first line is “It’s complicated.” But that doesn’t mean nothing is gained. The stories in “Wrestling Jerusalem” help to humanize issues too often spoken of in terms of land and politics. Every step forward, no matter how slight, is worth something."

An American hunter welling up over the body of the lion he has just shot; a South African rhino breeder calmly sawing the horns off his helpless charges. The intimacy of the film’s images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate.Wading hip-deep into the moral, emotional and economic confluence of big-game hunting and wildlife conservation, the movie reveals a world where animals must pay for their keep or risk extinction. From a hunt in Namibia to a safari lodge in South Africa, from an animal control program in Zimbabwe to a Las Vegas convention hall, the narrative becomes only more complex and confounding. At any moment, whoever is onscreen — the hunter who believes he has a God-given right to shoot animals; the anti-poaching officer whose work is financed in part by the hunting industry; the poor villagers endangered by animals that the wealthy pay to kill — might challenge our assumptions and expose our ignorance.Layered, thoughtful and infinitely curious, “Trophy” is shot so simply and beautifully, and with such nonjudgmental calm, that it’s easy to miss the ingenuity of its construction. Intervening solely to offer the occasional devastating statistic, the filmmakers allow our perceptions to shift and slide with each new piece of information. Here, canny businessman and genuine animal lover share the same skin, and a high-end safari outfitter is no less concerned for his beasts than the most vehement anti-hunting activist.This blurring of lines is nowhere more pronounced than in the efforts of John Hume, the rhino breeder, to discourage illegal poaching by legalizing the sale of rhino horn. A profoundly polarizing and finally tragic figure, Mr. Hume opens himself for condemnation. But be careful: That moral high ground you’re standing on might not be as solid as you think."

By a logic at once elusive and meticulous, it is also, therefore, about the consequences of inaction. Moral indifference is an easy path, and it leads to other, graver sins, including cruelty and dishonesty. But the harder road of decency has its own traps and byways, as a young doctor named Jenny Davin discovers.Jenny, played with somber concentration by Adèle Haenel, is devoted to her profession and her patients. She is thorough and compassionate, scolding her intern (Olivier Bonnaud) for failing to keep his emotions in check and communicating clearly and efficiently with the mostly poor people who come to her office. On the verge of moving into a more prestigious position, she decides, almost impulsively, to stay where she is, and take over her retired mentor’s small general practice. It’s what she loves, and she is loved in return.But in the Dardennes’ moral universe the ways of love are never simple. Having established that Jenny is a good person, the film allows her what at first seems to be a trivial lapse. Late one evening, long after office hours have finished, the front buzzer sounds and Jenny decides to ignore it. (That buzzer and the functional ringtone on Jenny’s cellphone are the film’s principal sound effects and the closest thing it has to a musical score.) The next morning, a woman is found dead nearby, and security video identifies her as the person who had been at Jenny’s door.Not much else is known about her, and Jenny, in a fit of self-reproach, tries to compensate for her neglect by finding out what she can. As they often have before — in “The Son,” “The Child” and “Lorna’s Silence,” most notably — the Dardennes use techniques of suspense to pursue an ethical problem. And vice versa. Jenny, stubborn in the face of her own fear and the threats and evasions of the people she encounters, is equal parts detective and priest. She uses the promise of doctor-patient confidentiality, a secular version of the seal of confession, to coax out shameful secrets. She also burrows into a demimonde of poverty, desperation and crime that exists just beyond her waiting room and sometimes spills into it.“The Unknown Girl” is as tense as a police procedural, and as mysterious as a religious parable. It’s a Dardenne brothers film, in other words, shot with unassuming lyricism and an eye for everyday detail and full of modest, eloquent performances (including from Jérémie Renier, the star of “The Child.”) The brothers’ methods are austere, but not harsh. They are students of human cruelty and champions of the resistance to it. In their world — in our world, as their unforgettable films reveal it to us — there is no end of guilt, and just enough grace."

As the movie opens on a bright spring day, he’s not up to much. He looks after a friend’s baby and won’t take money for it. He tools around Manhattan and Brooklyn on a bike. In a park, a group of Spanish-speaking women note his resemblance to an actor on an Argentine TV drama called “Rivales.” He shrugs it off with a nondenial-denial.Nico, played with unforced depth by Guillermo Pfening, actually is that actor. He’s in the United States because he’s tired of soap opera work (he’s also fleeing a failed love affair). He is promised a movie role in New York and doesn’t mind waiting tables while the production supposedly comes together.It’s emblematic of this film’s tone that the role falls through — putting his work visa situation into a bad bind — a half-hour into the movie. “Nobody’s Watching” addresses immigration issues head on, but it’s more about being set existentially adrift.Humiliations follow, including an encounter with an arrogant American film insider who bluntly tells Nico to darken his hair — his blond hair doesn’t exude stereotypical Latino vibes. His friendships suffer — the mother of the child he babysits for takes umbrage when he chats up a potential professional connection at her yoga class — as does his self-esteem after a fraught visit from a mentor who’s also a former lover.Ms. Solomonoff, an Argentine filmmaker based in New York, doesn’t fail to include scenes of stranger-in-a-strange-land exhilaration.

It is also, according to the interviewees in the film, a place where pollution has harmed the health of the populace.

Barbara Bouie, his wife, says that she saw an ear, nose and throat specialist who blamed “the Crossett crud” for her health problems. His advice? Move.We hear from a chemist and environmental science experts who have nothing good to say about their findings in Crossett, and while watching a movie is probably a poor way to assess air and water quality, what we see of the waterways, land and smoke-filled sky certainly looks damning. (Newsweek and The New Yorker, among others, have reported on the claims.)Many residents, who have historically depended on the mill for employment, don’t have the means to leave, and the film argues that the pollution has been allowed to continue because regulators are susceptible to political influence. (Georgia-Pacific is owned by Koch Industries; Ms. Kottke-Masocco initially went to Crossett as a co-producer on a documentary called “Koch Brothers Exposed.”) The film shows visiting staff members from the Environmental Protection Agency who do not appear overly concerned with the seriousness of the complaints."

A group of falcons, hooded and tethered to their man-made roosts, sits in the cabin of a private jet. A cheetah (unless it’s a jaguar) lounges in the passenger seat of a black Lamborghini.The cat would give the car a run for its money, and the birds could surely soar more gracefully than the plane, running on pigeon flesh rather than fossil fuel. This kind of absurdity is one of Mr. Ancarani’s motifs. Embedded with a group of rich young Qatari men, he films their leisure pursuits with elegant gravity and understated — all but unstated — wit. In addition to falconry and exotic pet ownership, the men cruise the desert in white SUVs and gold-plated motorcycles, recording their exploits on cellphones and stopping now and then to pray.The mixture of hedonism and piety that defines their lives — at least those parts that the film chooses to depict — is fascinating, and a different kind of documentary might have delved into the cultural, sociological and religious aspects of aristocratic life in the modern Middle East. But Mr. Ancarani’s allegiances are less to traditional journalistic approaches to documentary than to the immersive, anti-interpretive ethos of Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Véréna Paravel, J.P. Sniadecki and other exponents of what is sometimes called sensory ethnography. “The Challenge” emphasizes the first word in that phrase. Shot in rich, wide-screen color, with minimal camera movements (except when a small camera is attached to a falcon’s restless head) and almost no dialogue, it is detached almost to the point of abstraction.The young men look solemn in their pursuit of fun, which makes you curious about their inner lives and their ideas about the world they inhabit. The film neither satisfies that curiosity nor shares it, which is a justifiable aesthetic decision but also one that raises some mildly uncomfortable questions. In their white robes and red-and-white head scarves, Mr. Ancarani’s human subjects are less characters than pictorial elements — or, worse, occupants of the same menagerie as the captive predators they keep."

Among other activities, Ms. Leyden directs her students in “Hamlet.” Mr. Leyden, who teaches a range of subjects that include math and Latin, also leads rock band practice. (What well-rounded curriculum doesn’t include group covers of Ellie Goulding?)These seem like great kids, and their teachers are unflappable, open-minded and apparently good dog owners, too. But while Headfort may offer an aspirational model for schools, such pervasive niceness can come across as repetitive on screen, especially when a film concerns a topic as popular as education, which was explored in documentaries like Frederick Wiseman’s “High School,” Davis Guggenheim’s “Waiting for Superman” and many others.It’s fair for Ms. Ni Chianain to set sociological context aside, but only on a few occasions — when Mr. Dix leads a classroom debate on same-sex marriage, or Mr. Leyden must figure out how to deal with a new student who has missed band practice — does drama materialize."

(The prime minister, played by the Canadian bad-boy filmmaker Bruce LaBruce, briefly drops in to extend good wishes.) Not that Boris seems overly concerned: He carries on an interoffice affair, banters with Beatrice’s pretty caregiver (Isolda Dychauk) and expresses exasperation at his daughter’s liberal ideals.Then a mysterious note invites him to a nighttime meeting with a stranger played by Denis Lavant, whose genius for contortion (“Beau Travail,” “Holy Motors”) seems underutilized in a film of sterile, generally static tableaus. “What would you say if I told you that Beatrice was ill because of you?” the stranger asks. And so Boris is impelled to improve his attitude.As film subjects go, the soullessness of the upper crust counts as low-hanging fruit, even before “Boris Without Beatrice” begins drawing a faintly meaningful parallel between Boris’s life and that of Tantalus, for whom sustenance was always just out of reach. Watching the movie can feel the same way."

So his central presence in “The Limehouse Golem,” a baroque Victorian whodunit set in London’s East End, is like a wink-wink signal that what we’re seeing is being played for laughs, not scares. Yet despite the lurid images and florid dialogue, this over-the-top adaptation of Peter Ackroyd’s 1994 novel takes itself very seriously indeed.Which can make the penny-dreadful plot even more giggle-icious. As Kildare, the dogged police inspector on the tail of a hyperactive serial killer, Mr. Nighy performs a symphony of sneers, squints and suspicious lip-pursing. Around Kildare, the public is baying for details of the splattery crimes. At the same time, the vaudeville star Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke, last seen in “Bates Motel”) is on trial for poisoning her husband. The narratives will converge, but not before traversing a louche landscape of sadomasochism and genital mutilation.Meanwhile, we watch Lizzie’s rise from street to stage and from abuse to applause, mentored by the cross-dressing comedian Dan Leno (a marvelous Douglas Booth). Marrying fact and fiction, Jane Goldman’s seamy screenplay is wildly overstuffed; but the director, Juan Carlos Medina, gives the music hall scenes a rowdy authenticity. Jack the Ripper is skulking in the wings and Karl Marx lounges in the British Museum, but onstage — as in the movie theater — the killer’s depravity is simply entertainment."

Exploring a similar idea with significantly less resonance, the writers of “Rememory,” Mark Palansky (who also directed) and Michael Vukadinovich, mash a fertile premise into sentimental mush.Sinking in the mire are some fine actors, including Anton Yelchin (in one of his last roles) and the great Peter Dinklage as Sam Bloom, the traumatized survivor of a car crash that killed his brother. Saved from suicide by Gordon Dunn (Martin Donovan), a psychologist who has invented a machine that recovers memories, Sam turns into an amateur sleuth when Dunn also winds up expired.A hodgepodge of pseudoscientific twaddle and variously shifty murder suspects, “Rememory” satisfies neither as science fiction nor as psychological drama. Pilfering Dunn’s machine from under the nose of his distracted widow (Julia Ormond, whose every scene is a banquet built from table scraps), Sam delves into the recorded memories of its test subjects. But in a movie that’s more about processing grief than finding a killer, his quest is no more than a soggy slog from one damaged soul to another.Yet Mr. Palansky, whose last movie was the peculiar “Penelope” in 2006, could have mined gold from the technology itself — as “Black Mirror” did by exploring the destructive desire to witness the memories of a lover. Instead, he uses the device mainly as an excuse to stuff the movie with fractured, random Kodak moments, interspersed with scenes of Mr. Dinklage gazing sorrowfully. I imagine his expression closely mirrored my own."

Its heroine, Luce, is a self-possessed 17-year-old making her way through the jungle of a new school, navigating unfriendly cliques and obsessing over glowering boys even as a supernatural shadow threatens her safety and her sanity.Fans of the popular “Twilight” series will recognize its influence on “Fallen,” which swaps the public school vampires of “Twilight” for boarding school angels. Despite being wooed by a smooth-talking immortal bad boy, Luce (Addison Timlin) is drawn to another admirer, an angel (Jeremy Irvine) who is destined to love her and her alone through all of eternity. Yet the very magic that secures his eternal love presents a threat to her mortal life. Teenage angst and biblical retribution ensue.Like other fixtures of the Y.A. genre, “Fallen” is filmed with a professional sheen that sacrifices emotional sincerity for high production values. Directed by the veteran filmmaker Scott Hicks, of “Shine” and “No Reservations,” “Fallen” thrives when capturing the misty mood of Luce’s gothic school, Sword & Cross. But burdened with ideas of reincarnation and Christian mythos, the supposedly swooning love triangle among Luce and her beatific beaus lacks any of the organic interaction that could produce chemistry. Perhaps that’s why the standout performance in “Fallen” occurs on the sidelines of its romance. In a supporting role, Lola Kirke charms as Luce’s obsessive, motormouth friend Penn. Without multiple lifetimes of exposition weighing on her performance, Ms. Kirke is free to relax into playing a teenager."

Gena (Erica Peeples) is an aspiring writer, Quadir (Columbus Short) is a cocaine kingpin. Their love promises a new beginning, but there may be no way to exit a life on the streets. Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name, the hustlers of “True to the Game” are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods’s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago, this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. It’s all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss.In the best circumstances, the familiarity of the crime genre can provide an opportunity for a filmmaker to flex their point of view, but the direction, by Preston A. Whitmore II, seems hampered by either a lack of resources or a lack of interest. The camera lingers on expensive cars, but club scenes appear threadbare. Quadir and his rivals are supposedly the toughest high rollers in the game, but their virility is primarily conveyed through their conspicuously manicured beards. Among the actors, Vivica A. Fox commands a cameo appearance with an authority and charisma that outweighs any of the movie’s leads — including Mr. Short’s Quadir. And Nelsan Ellis, in one of his last film roles, is underutilized as Quadir’s cutthroat second-in-command. To its detriment, “True to the Game” tries to reform kingpins before it maximizes on its own investments."

At their son’s wedding, she learns that Robin has accepted a job transfer from the East Coast to Wichita, Kan. He hasn’t bothered to consult Joan at all, assuming she will tag along.Later, in bed, Robin, played with brisk pretensions of authority by Michael Cristofer, shrugs off her concerns with something like contempt. At the end of their argument, Joan, played by Karen Allen with patience and precision, asks, “Why do you love me?” Mishearing, he says “Yes.” When she repeats the question, he responds, “Because you’re my wife. Men love their wives.” Twisting his knife, he finishes, “And their mothers.”Here, what seemed to Joan like a good marriage unveils itself as something wholly other. The movie deliberately descends from this brutal height to something friendlier, more encouraging and, alas, substantially more quaint.Based on a memoir by Joan Anderson, “Year by the Sea” depicts Joan taking up solo residence in Cape Cod, in search of self-realization. After meeting an array of droll locals, she encounters a woman (Celia Imrie), a dancer and the wife of the pioneering psychoanalyst Erik Erikson — who, among other things, coined the term “identity crisis.” .The writer-director Alexander Janko is also a composer, and he leavens the movie’s anecdotal structure with airs designed to enhance aperçus like “From adversity comes transcendence.” The movie is not entirely my cup of tea, although it is refreshing in its depiction of diverse, older female characters (including Joan’s quirky literary agent, played by S. Epatha Merkerson). The pleasure of Joan’s screen company is not insubstantial."

D. Salinger’s literary agent Dorothy Olding (Sarah Paulson) says in “Rebel in the Rye.”“Tell them no. And to stop calling,” he replies, briskly.Salinger’s disinclination stemmed from disappointment over the film “My Foolish Heart” (1949), based on his story “Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut.”Filmmakers are still eyeing “The Catcher in the Rye,” but Salinger’s estate is holding the line. Danny Strong, making his directorial feature debut, won some kind of lottery in getting the rights to a critical biography by Kenneth Slawenski. Mr. Strong seizes on the idea of Holden Caulfield as a Salinger alter ego and runs hard with it.While “Rebel in the Rye” isn’t quite as bad as its pile-of-bricks-clunky title suggests, it’s both simple- and literal-minded, less concerned with Salinger’s consciousness or sensibility than with his ostensible ontological status as a Tortured Creative Giant. Its depiction of Salinger’s probable PTSD, the product of his service in World War II, is almost insultingly hackneyed. When he discovers meditation through an Indian guru, the score, by Bear McCreary, comes alive with tablas and sitars. And so on.Nicholas Hoult plays Salinger with keen timing and palpable commitment, yet seems respectfully removed from the role. The only moments that set a spark pit him against Kevin Spacey as Whit Burnett, an early mentor. Their last scene together ends on a note that would, in a better movie, carry real emotional devastation."

It is in these mundane moments that the director and writer Paul Shoulberg finds a story.Father Daniel (Zachary Spicer) is a young priest who looks like a model from a 1950s Catholic schoolbook — right down to his sweater vest collection and perfectly parted hair. He works under the elder Father Victor (Danny Glover), a by-the-book priest, and Father Ollie (John C. McGinley), a sports-obsessed Franciscan priest, in a Midwestern college town. During a confessional shift, Father Daniel listens to the problems of a coffee shop singer-songwriter, Jane (Wrenn Schmidt), and offers her friendship instead of a penance.“The Good Catholic” is almost as strait-laced as its protagonist. As Jane develops a crush on Daniel, the movie starts to follow a conventional path. Her character, given little screen time to match Daniel’s soul-searching, is most wanting. Some of Mr. Shoulberg’s directorial decisions — actors’ eyes drifting offscreen at an invisible audience — look theatrical rather than cinematic.Fortunately, Mr. Spicer’s earnest performance bolsters many of the weaker spots in Mr. Shoulberg’s script. The conflicting dynamics among the three men of the cloth provide most of the movie’s punch lines. Mr. Glover and Mr. McGinley each have their own scene-stealing one-liners to bounce off Mr. Spicer’s deadpan delivery. Here, friendship is its own form of saving grace."

If you’ve watched any of Ms. Meyers’s movies, the resemblance between influence and imitation will be readily apparent. To wit: A star (Reese Witherspoon) plays a would-be charmer (here called Alice) whose neuroses are as fabulously customized as her kitchen. She’s what the brand-conscious call a creative, and while she works (a bit), she spends much of her time on man troubles. Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle, which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy, at least in Nancy Meyers’s hands.“Home Again,” on the other hand, is wholly resistible, partly because it can’t fulfill the promise of that aspirational fantasy either on a craft level or in terms of its emotional and psychological portraiture. The problems begin with the script, or perhaps just with the insulting idea that Alice would be crying buckets into a mirror because she’s turning 40 on the day the story opens. Yes, she is newly separated from her music-industry husband (Michael Sheen), who likes to take calls from his New York office with its sweeping view. Alice doesn’t seem too bent out of shape by the separation. She’s busy building a new career as an interior decorator, and has moved with her two daughters into her childhood home, which she has redecorated to look like something out of a lower-budget Nancy Meyers movie.So why is Alice crying? Mostly to try to jump-start a movie that, formulaic step by step, needs to confirm that a single woman can be happy. You go, girl. That’s more or less it, with accent pieces and yoga lessons, though there are plot complications, some involving three friends, white dudes who had a hit at a film festival and now have a power agency behind them, several freelance gigs and, of course, the promise of great shining futures as Hollywood filmmakers. The three shack up in Alice’s guesthouse and soon they’re all one smiley family, which might be odd because they’re strangers and she has young daughters — except that this isn’t reality, it’s a bubble.Of course it is. Its three dudes, who sail from festival hype to Hollywood, evoke the fairy-tale trajectories of directors like Colin Trevorrow, who went from making a tiny movie to “Jurassic World.” Ms. Meyers-Shyer has taken a parallel path, one followed by members of the Coppola clan. Ms. Meyers helped produce “Home Again” and her former husband and filmmaking partner, Charles Shyer, served as their daughter’s second unit director. Alice’s dead father was a director, too. Canisters of film sit, no doubt decaying, in a sun-filled room, the same one in which his Oscar — the apotheosis of this movie’s aspirational thinking — stands as a shining testament to a daughter’s love and her picture’s absurdity."

Pennywise the clown, the designated predator in “It,” (played by Bill Skarsgard) is, like Freddy Krueger, an avatar of deep childhood fears. And like Freddy, he’s also the literal, lethal manifestation of the evil of the world. As such, he has the potential to spawn endless sequels. He’ll be back.Or rather, he is back. Mr. Muschietti’s “It,” written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, represents a second trip to this particular well. Mr. King’s novel, published in 1986, was adapted for network television in 1990. The new movie, a skillful blend of nostalgic sentiment and hair-raising effects, with the visual punch of big-screen digital hocus-pocus and the liberties of the R rating, still has the soothing charm of familiarity. The gang of misfit ’80s kids who face down the clown and the deeper horror he represents evoke both the middle school posse of the recent TV series “Stranger Things” (there’s some overlap in the cast), but also the intrepid brotherhood from “Stand by Me,” surely one of the all-time top five Stephen King movie adaptations.We can argue about the others — I’m happy to make a case for John Carpenter’s underrated “Christine” — but this “It” doesn’t quite ascend to their level. Nonetheless, the filmmakers honor both the pastoral and the infernal dimensions of Mr. King’s distinctive literary vision. Derry, with its redbrick storefronts and its quirks and kinks, seems like a genuinely nice place to live in spite of the fact that its citizens, children in particular, turn up missing or maimed at an alarming rate.VideoThe director Andy Muschietti narrates a scene from ""It,"" featuring Wyatt Oleff as Stanley Uris.Published OnSept. 6, 2017CreditCreditBrooke Palmer/Warner BrothersThe supernatural nastiness embodied by Pennywise is abetted and to some extent camouflaged by the ordinary human awfulness that also afflicts Derry. In addition to menacing clowns, phantasmatic lepers and spooky paintings come to life, the town is home to an ugly assortment of bullies (the worst one played by Nicholas Hamilton), gossips and abusive parents.Against these forces — the banal and the diabolical alike — “It” assembles a squad of early and preadolescent ghostbusters as varied as an infantry platoon in a World War II combat picture. The leader is Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), a melancholy, thoughtful boy whose little brother, Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), has been spirited down a storm sewer by Pennywise. Bill’s comrades — they call themselves the Losers’ Club — include a nerdy chatterbox (Finn Wolfhard) and a germ-phobic mama’s boy (Jack Dylan Grazer), plus a Jewish kid (Wyatt Oleff), a black kid (Chosen Jacobs) and a new kid (Jeremy Ray Taylor). Also a girl, Bev (Sophia Lillis), who becomes part of a sweet, alliterative romantic triangle involving Bill and the new kid, whose name is Ben.Like many real kids — even in 1989, even in Maine — they have filthy mouths. They also experience the freedom and peril of growing up in the days before cellphones, bicycle helmets and helicopter parenting. What’s scary about “It,” for them and for the audience, is also fun. The group ranges freely through the forests and fields around Derry, playing detective until the forces of darkness stand revealed with slimy tentacles and multiple rows of sharp, ravenous teeth.That isn’t a spoiler, but it’s a bit of paradox. The non-clown essence of It, an H.R. Gigeresque vagina dentata type of deal, is far less scary than Pennywise, with his fluting voice and red balloons, and the other specters that seem to spring from tender young psyches. As creature design has become easier and more elaborate, thanks to digital techniques, it has also become less imaginative. Movie monsters resemble one another more and more, and movies of distinct genres feel increasingly trapped within the expected. The climactic sequence of “It” sacrifices horror-movie creepiness for action-movie bombast, staging a big fight in a cavernous space. We might as well be looking at superheroes.That we aren’t comes as a relief. The young cast is consistently good company, in particular the Ben-Bill-Bev trio. Ms. Lillis earns the Molly Ringwald reference that mischievously pops up in the script as a wink to those in the audience who still remember the ’80s. What a great time that was to be afraid."

For decades, the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year, they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent, urgent concerns. Word by word, they push and pull, challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world’s a stage, but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real, especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances.Perched on a hilltop some two hours south of Florence, Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town’s “Teatro Povero (a folk theater production)”; another notes its “forbidding walls” and “medieval past,” assuring readers that it’s “well worth exploring” even if over all “there is nothing much in the way of sights.” These mercenary assessments are meant, of course, for harried, hurried travelers, including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation.In their documentary “Spettacolo,” Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen stay a while. Their most obvious subject is the annual production that Monticchiello townspeople have mounted since the 1960s, when some could remember the Fascist occupation firsthand. In the early years, the residents put on pageants that, at least from the modest documentation in the movie, seem like elaborations on other regional events, like the centuries-old horse race called the Palio in nearby Siena. At some point, the Monticchiello residents turned to the more immediate past, revisiting, for instance, the trauma of the war and the day Nazis lined the villagers up, threatening to shoot them all.ImageAndrea Cresti, an artist who is the longtime director of the town’s theater.CreditGrasshopper Film More recently, the economy has fueled the spettacolo, which the movie’s notes define as “performance, spectacle or play.” That was certainly the case in 2012, when the bulk of the movie was shot over a period of six months. In interviews, Mr. Malmberg has said that he and Ms. Shellen happened on Monticchiello while on a vacation. (Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen, who are married, share directing credit; he shot and edited the documentary, and she recorded sound.) They were ambling around, rather like the day trippers in the documentary, when they accidentally came across Andrea Cresti, an artist who turned out to be theater’s longtime director as well as the portal into this story.There’s very little about the making of the documentary itself in “Spettacolo,” which assumes the point of view of the unobtrusive, not-quite omniscient witness. The people tell their stories directly on camera, at times with deep emotion, their reminiscences augmented by faded photographs and archival moving images. The history of the theater emerges gradually as assorted personalities — former partisans, an ailing woman, an indifferent son — click into place. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cresti, a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair, becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town’s latest collective concerns into its next big show.As the spettacolo takes shape with fractious dialogue and insistent politics, it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production, in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly), Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region, yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green, the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle, insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town’s annual production, the movie is telling its own story dialectically.That story can be so poignant and is so intelligently told that it feels wrong, almost insulting, to call “Spettacolo” charming, even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks, charm tends to be a commercial marker, a signifier for an imaginary, easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were, after all, on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums, even if the global economy, its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise."

This leads to a cumbersome group effort to haul the body out of an upstairs window — and that’s before Durga (Asha Magrati), who had been tending to Chitra, touches the corpse, an action forbidden for women.The arrival of one of Chitra’s sons, Chandra (Dayahang Rai), from Kathmandu generates additional tension. Chandra left the village to fight with the anti-monarchical Maoist rebels in the civil war that lasted from 1996 to 2006 and ended with the authoritarian king removed from power. Durga, to whom he was married, wants him to certify that he is the father of her daughter, Pooja (Sumi Malla), even though the girl was conceived while Chandra was off fighting. Without the papers, Pooja can’t attend school. One alternative signatory is Chandra’s brother, Suraj (Rabindra Singh Baniya), who, like his recently departed father, supported the monarchy. (Whether the body should be draped in a flag is just one argument during the film-long attempts to lay Chitra to rest.)The filmmaking isn’t flashy and the exchanges can be on the nose, but “White Sun,” which was shown earlier this year at the New Directors/New Films festival in New York, captures a place that isn’t seen much in movies. It shows how the lingering disputes of war ripple through lives after guns have ostensibly been laid down."

The Vulture writer Kyle Buchanan has already provided a rundown of the substantial delays in the film’s release, which — for a project once regarded as an Oscar contender — might be taken as a sign of an odor other than floral. This week, Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, the film’s distributor, took the extraordinary step of defending the movie in advance with a column for Deadline Hollywood, though it is laced with passive-aggressive barbs like “I know this film’s not perfect, very few are, but it’s a perfectly good time in a movie theater.”Plenty of movies fit that description — and considering the hoopla, the most disappointing thing about “Tulip Fever,” directed by Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”) and set in 17th-century Amsterdam, is that it’s neither a secret masterpiece nor a laughable disaster. True, there is the scene in which Jan (Dane DeHaan), the hunky portraitist having an affair with Sophia (Alicia Vikander), the unhappily married wife of a merchant, explains to her that the key to their escape is to bet big in the Dutch tulip market. “All we have to do is put all our eggs in one basket,” he says.Howlers like that are few and far between, though, in a script credited to Tom Stoppard and Deborah Moggach, adapting her own novel, that faithfully follows the template for overripe period dramas. The re-creation of Amsterdam in the Golden Age is credible, the sweeping camera moves look like a great workout, and the compositions suggest someone studied Vermeer. There is also a fascination with the milieu, in which speculators, owing to tulips’ value at the time, would bid on bulbs, prizing rare varieties and creating a soaring market that ultimately crashed. Even an abbess (Judi Dench) gets in on the action.Alas, the movie is not “The Wolf of Waalstraat” and more directly concerns a familiar love triangle. To ensure her siblings’ passage to New Amsterdam, the city that became New York, the orphaned Sophia has married Cornelis Sandvoort (Christoph Waltz), described as “the king of peppercorns.” Despite his ritualized lovemaking, she fails to conceive an heir. When her servant, Maria (Holliday Grainger, who also narrates) becomes pregnant by the fishmonger (Jack O’Connell), Sophia proposes a scheme in which Cornelis can keep the baby. In the meantime, Sophia must merely pretend to be pregnant while Maria pretends not to be. This unconvincing charade culminates in one of the silliest birth scenes in recent memory.The star turns — including one from Zach Galifianakis as the sort of drunk you do not want to entrust with your nest egg — stave off boredom, but the most disappointing thing about the end to the speculative bubble surrounding “Tulip Fever” is that there isn’t much there."

Burning hormones for fuel, this hyperconfident first feature from the Brazilian director Anita Rocha da Silveira vividly pinpoints a time when everything is heightened. Feelings, colors and sounds sear and blaze, and death delivers the same frisson as sex.Especially for Bia (Valentina Herszage, 15 at the time of filming) and her three friends, whose upscale Rio de Janeiro neighborhood is suffering a rash of violent rapes and murders. Glistening apartment blocks gird a desolate construction site where the bodies are found and where Bia — in a scene that encapsulates the picture’s silly-chilly mood — gently kisses the bloodied lips of one near-dead girl. The killer might still be at large, but his identity is beside the point, his victims simply the aphrodisiac that ignites the movie’s atmosphere of sinister arousal.Clinging unswervingly to the girls’ viewpoints, “Kill Me Please” is at once brash and subtle, blissed out and razor sharp. Long, stalking shots of deserted roads and darkening landscapes alternate with the flares of garish color in a kaleidoscopic birthday party, and the rainbow fluorescence of a bus shelter at night. (The stunning cinematography is by João Atala.) And as Bia becomes increasingly obsessed with one of the victims, the director surrounds her with zombie-movie signifiers — like a herd of silent students, viewed from above, slowly exiting a school — that underscore the dazed sensuality of her actions.Sharing selfies and urban legends, the four friends are an unselfconscious sorority, flirting with the camera and making out with abandon. The corruption of innocent flesh — by hickeys and herpes and worse — might be a heavy-handed metaphor, but when it’s rendered this gorgeously, who can complain?"

The filmmakers behind “Hazlo Como Hombre” are counting on it. Otherwise, there's little appeal to this romantic comedy’s protagonist, a man so unlikable the movie opens with an M.P.A.A.-style warning for the character’s sexism, homophobia and machismo.Raúl (Mauricio Ochmann) is a walking prehistoric machista — a man who thinks he has the right to cheat on his pregnant wife and act disgusted at the slightest homoerotic gesture. But after his best friend (Alfonso Dosal) breaks off his engagement to Raúl’s sister (Aislinn Derbez) and comes out to his friends, Raúl is at a loss for words. Fortunately, everyone else in the movie seems unmoved by the news. Unfortunately, we’re stuck with Raúl.Of course, there are intolerant people everywhere, but Nicolás López’s movie isn’t clever enough to make its lead character sympathetic or multidimensional, only more insufferable. The movie asphyxiates on tired jokes about anal sex, dropping the soap in the shower and a transgender prostitute. Aside from references to hookup apps and hipsters, there's little in Mr. López and Guillermo Amoedo’s outdated script that doesn’t seem like it was written 20 years ago.The movie flouts its intolerance in an attempt at provocative humor. Unless you laugh at fossils, I have no idea why you should buy a ticket to gawk at this dinosaur."

Set in present-day Memphis, it focuses on two people who are just barely clinging to the margins. Abe (David Harewood) works as a janitor, pushing brooms and cleaning up other people’s waste; he spends much of the rest of his time in church. Melva (Edwina Findley Dickerson), a single mother, has a desk job but pours much of her energy into the care of her two children, particularly a son she can scarcely control and whose outbursts slip into frightening violence.Abe and Melva meet through church. A tentative bond takes shape amid the humble pews and reverberant call and response, as the Pentecostal worshipers echo the resounding ministering. Soon, along with a few other congregants, Abe forms a prayer circle with the intention of healing Melva’s son, Benny (RaJay Chandler). Together, the congregants pray over Benny, who’s lain supine on the altar on a simple cloth. As he moans and sometimes thrashes, they praise and they plead, begging for help from above while pledging their love. They’re seeking a miracle for the child who increasingly looks like a sacrifice.The writer-director Jake Mahaffy’s elliptical storytelling conveys meaning largely in visual and auditory bits, in shots of hands raised in prayer, in images of men and women isolated in the frame. The movie’s realism owes much to the lived-in locations and its two excellent leads, who fill in the gaps with nuanced emotional texture; the script doesn’t tell you much about who these people are, but the actors do. Such is the case with Mr. Harewood, whose rigorously restrained physical performance — a heavily bowed head, arms tightly crossed over his chest — conveys a desperate attempt at self-control and an unspoken burden that seems as if it should break a man.Unlike Abe, Melva is still open to the world — her children, it’s suggested, are one reason — which makes her especially poignant. She’s a single mother and struggling, but she isn’t a casualty or a case file: She goes out with girlfriends, tends to her children. Yet if she isn’t broken when the movie opens, she has begun to buckle. Ms. Dickerson draws you to her slowly and inevitably with hopeful smiles, glints of panic and fear; her tears dribble and then cascade but are always earned. Like Mr. Harewood (from TV’s “Homeland”), Ms. Dickerson (“The Wire”) is one of a legion of very fine performers working in television who deserve to be in more movies.Mr. Mahaffy’s oblique approach, which owes more to the classic art film than to the commercial mainstream, can be frustrating. At times, his visual style announces itself too overtly; and he tends to be too withholding, as if he were concerned about being obvious or falling into melodrama. He parses out information about his characters incrementally in scenes that come across less like moments from fully realized lives and more like flashcards: a man walking amid debris to imply alienation and abjection. The results occasionally feel coy, but each time the movie edges into mannerism Mr. Harewood and Ms. Dickerson pull you close enough to make it hurt."

The film carries a trace of the sweep of a great screen epic along with the straightforward, explanatory qualities of mass-audience TV, and is never less than absorbing.Smoothly interweaving the perspectives of British rulers at the viceroy’s house in Delhi and those of their Indian staff, it offers a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the motives of Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville), Britain’s last viceroy to colonial India, who oversaw the transfer of power. That process is still hotly debated: The partition of India, which created an independent India and Pakistan, led to the displacement of more than 10 million people and mass carnage in the resulting violence.Gurinder Chadha, the British-raised director of “Bend It Like Beckham,” closes the film with an ode to her grandmother, who sought refuge from Pakistan in India. As its personal entry point, the film offers a love story between Jeet (Manish Dayal), a Hindu who works as one of Mountbatten’s servants, and Aalia (Huma Qureshi), a Muslim who is betrothed to someone else and may end up on the opposite side of a new border.Famous figures — including Mohandas K. Gandhi (Neeraj Kabi), Jawaharlal Nehru (Tanveer Ghani) and Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Denzil Smith) — are supporting but pivotal players. Impeccable production design and some fine performances, including Gillian Anderson’s as Mountbatten’s wife, hold this film together."

But “The Layover,” which probably scrapes by thanks to a line here or there, plays as if it were designed to thumb its nose at the concept.Directed by William H. Macy, for some reason, and written by David Hornsby and Lance Krall, the movie concerns two longtime Seattle friends who, when not in the presence of men, watch “The Bachelor.” Kate (Alexandra Daddario) is a teacher; Meg (Kate Upton) aspires to sell luxury cosmetics, though no one is buying her North Korean imports.To cure workplace blues, the pair hop a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and wind up seated next to Ryan (Matt Barr), their mutual masculine ideal. His half-interested presence compels them into destructive, flirty one-upmanship, especially after a hurricane diverts their plane to St. Louis (not the best-timed plot point) and they run into Ryan at their hotel.It’s a Sheraton, incidentally; if the chain didn’t pay for product placement, its logo and amenities got quite a bit of free play. Given the dimwitted clientele, however, the advertisement may not be such a steal. After Meg and Kate peacock for Ryan in a hot-air balloon and a diving competition, they hit the road, where the movie’s notion of fun comes to involve an unclean rest stop, slipped pills and an eminently foreseeable conclusion."

Until I Don’t,” Lake Bell’s pained sex comedy, is that there’s a lot of money in happy endings. And not the kind that are typically tacked onto movies like this one.Rather, the massage-parlor treat promised here is an anniversary gift from Cybil (Mary Steenburgen) to her longtime husband, Harvey (Paul Reiser). But the giving is itself an act of such passive-aggressive loathing that it all but destroys any comedic potential in their relationship, never mind any desire we might have to see their union endure.In that we’re joined by Vivian (Dolly Wells), a bitter British filmmaker who believes marriage to be unsustainable. To prove her thesis, she has enlisted Cybil and Harvey plus two more fractured Florida couples for what she is pleased to call a documentary. Ms. Bell (who also wrote the preposterous script) and Ed Helms play an unhappily childless twosome who practice “results-based” sex by means of a phone app that tracks ovarian cycles. And Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac are hippie-dippie caricatures whose free-love philosophy is as much a sham as Vivian’s filmmaking ethics.Painted in the broadest possible strokes, these ropy relationships agitate a movie that has neither a coherent point nor an authentic character. There’s little evidence here of the talent that made Ms. Bell’s 2013 filmmaking debut, “In a World ...” (about struggling voice-over artists), as gentle and genuine as this one is abrasive and cartoonish. Hanging out with these folks is no fun; being married to some of them is unimaginable."

Instead of Cold War chess moves in the mode of “Funeral in Berlin,” it serves up the ostensible threat of Islamist terror. Racine is an undercover C.I.A. agent posing as an employment counselor in London. She’s loath to do fieldwork because she feels responsible for not thwarting a terrorist strike in Paris years ago. But she’s pulled back in by the prospect of a horrifying biological attack. She needs to interrogate — “unlock” in spy-speak — a courier whose message could set the plan in motion, or stop it.And here the movie goes very old school, piling on spy thriller tropes: double crosses; chases; a stock taciturn white-haired would-be assassin (who, conveniently enough, can’t quite draw a bead on our heroine); an eager recruit who might as well be nicknamed Dead Meat; and dialogue like “I’m thinking I’m the only friend you’ve got.”I suppose this went down easily enough for me because I grew up with this kind of stuff, and can surrender to it as a kind of cinematic comfort food. But still. For those not so inclined, the entertainment value could conceivably be derived from the brisk, no-nonsense direction by Michael Apted, and the talents of what they used to call “an all-star cast” — in this case, Michael Douglas, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Orlando Bloom."

The antisocial demeanors and antics of these men eventually result in grave harm to an innocent.Jesús (Nicolás Durán) and his crew smoke dope, drink 40-ounces, watch drug-cartel execution videos on the internet, inveigle sex from girls they later insult behind their backs, and so on. And one night they brutally beat a young man in the park who is too drunk to walk, because they think he’s gay. This is followed almost immediately by a scene of Jesús having sex with one of his male friends, because, you know, of course. The beating makes national news, and Jesús turns to his father, from whom he has long been alienated.This movie has a lot of the stylistic and content hallmarks of what passes for committed realism in contemporary world cinema. A hand-held camera is often following the lead character from behind. There are explicit, seemingly unsimulated sex scenes. The filmmakers were inspired by a recent real-life event in Santiago. One feels the filmmaker trying hard to work out the inner struggles of his sad but largely unsympathetic characters. But his movie is as miserable and ultimately confounding as it is earnest."

Just choose a side: Bobby Kennedy, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have sung her praises, while Richard Nixon, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly have disparaged her ideas. Better yet, judge her by her accomplishments, which are outlined in “Dolores,” a documentary that extols her lifelong, and seemingly unlimited, fighting spirit in the service of workers’ rights.Born in the United States and of Latin American heritage, Ms. Huerta took up community organizing at a young age before meeting Cesar Chavez and helping found what would become the United Farm Workers. For decades she led unionizing efforts, lobbied politicians and coordinated events (including a widespread grape boycott and workers strike in the 1960s). Throughout the film we see her campaigning for civil rights and protesting unsafe labor conditions, sometimes putting herself in harm’s way.Peter Bratt, the director, uses an immense amount of historical footage and interviews, arranged with clarity. Although his film is intended to applaud Ms. Huerta, he doesn’t shy away from the toll her travels and choices took on her family. Several of her 11 children are interviewed, and they express pride in their mother, yet recall the deep unhappiness they felt when growing up, often without her around. The sexism that hindered her, too, isn’t glossed over.Ms. Huerta, now 87, continues her efforts. As a girl, she says, she had wanted to be a dancer. In some way you can see that in her work: She has made activism an art form."

These range from the menial (fixing her washing machine) to the potentially ruinous (smuggling a cake to Moscow by plane, which could cost a father who works at the airport his job). Ms. Maurery has great fun with the character, a tricky part because Maria nearly always maintains a kindhearted veneer, even at her most venal. It’s clear she has no regard for her class’s well-being or education.While somewhat on the nose as allegory, the movie deftly illustrates that a culture of collaboration — whether in Bratislava in the 1980s or, indeed, any political or workplace context — requires active participation, even if subconscious. When Maria backs down on the cake-smuggling request, Marek (Csongor Kassai), the airport accountant, is so relieved that he offers to drive her to her country cottage, seemingly oblivious that he’s being pressed into a different kind of service.Most of what we see of Maria comes in flashbacks during a parents’ conference the school’s head teacher (Ina Gogalova) has convened, risking her own job because Maria is the chair of the Communist Party at the school. But if enough parents sign a formal complaint, they may be able to oust her.There are shades of “12 Angry Men” in the scenes of the parents trying to convince one another to sign it. Contrary to the idea that strength comes in numbers, “The Teacher” illustrates that some of the parents, while individually upset, are afraid to speak up as a group. They’ve already bought into a corrupt system, acceding to the teacher’s demands, and signing the petition is tantamount to an admission of guilt.Like Mr. Hrebejk’s “Divided We Fall” — a story of a sheepish Czech gentile who locates a vein of courage and generosity during the Nazi occupation — “The Teacher” is polished, engaging and somewhat risk-averse. True, there’s nothing lighthearted about the plot, which finds one student driven toward suicide and an astrophysicist father (Peter Bebjak), whose wife has left him, reduced to washing windows.But “The Teacher” doesn’t dare take its premise to darker places by having Maria prod the parents too far beyond the bounds of their own moral compasses — a logical conclusion of this story. As the psychologist Stanley Milgram’s experiments on obedience showed — and some governments have learned — a flock in thrall to an authority figure may follow that person anywhere."

The screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson and the director George Nolfi only intermittently manage to breathe credible cinematic life into that milieu in “Birth of the Dragon,” which is set in late ’60s San Francisco, where, the movie tells us, Lee taught kung fu. (It was actually Oakland.)The movie’s linchpin is a real-life battle between Lee (Philip Ng) and a Shaolin monk, Wong Jack Man (Yu Xia), which an opening title says was reputed to have been spurred by Wong’s objection to Lee’s “kung fu for all” ethos. In the movie’s view, Lee’s real problem is his bluff arrogance. Wong’s approach is more spiritual, less egocentric. This attracts one of Lee’s white students, the overly aggressive Steve (Billy Magnussen), who happens to be in love with a young Asian immigrant who’s being groomed for a concubine’s life by a female boss. Steve can’t fight for her, but the boss is interested in staging an event that can generate some gambling profits. You see where this is going. For the sake of their pal, Wong and Lee agree to test each other in battle. It’s clear that Wong is right about Lee’s egotism being a limitation, but the question is whether Lee will get it.The “West Side Story” romance angle is the least interesting part of the movie, so it’s frustrating that so much time is spent on it. “Birth of the Dragon” is ambitious: It wants to be a character study, an explication of martial arts philosophy and an action picture. (The battle scenes are presented in a mix of slow motion with super-clear fast-shutter shots and they’re not always enhanced by this approach.) But the film never really gets fully juiced until the climax, when rivalries are put aside and the two very charismatic leads get on the same side to kick some righteous butt."

(Like Ms. Hittman’s first feature, “It Felt Like Love,” “Beach Rats” doubles as a portrait of Brooklyn’s southern-shore neighborhoods, lyrically photographed by Hélène Louvart.)During a fireworks show, Frankie effortlessly — in the sense of exerting no effort — catches the eye of Simone (Madeline Weinstein), who flirts with him oblivious to his uncertain sexuality. After initially taking her home only to rebuff her, he spends much of the movie waffling on the relationship, trying to make it work and even defensively confessing to a man he accompanies to a motel for sex that he has a girlfriend.Frankie’s drug intake, his ailing father, his relationships with his mother (Kate Hodge) and younger sister (Nicole Flyus) and perhaps even his reluctance to leave familiar surroundings all contribute to a powerful sense of limbo. The back-and-forths of the character’s decisions feel real, and Mr. Dickinson’s laconic blankness (you would never guess the actor was British) helps to give Frankie’s existential crisis a charge. Ms. Hittman is also assured enough to know it can’t be easily resolved."

With arms outstretched from the sides of the screen, and our eyes taking in the perspective of the killer, we shoot, hack and beat our way through a sea of assailants.As directed by Jung Byung-gil, a former stuntman, the film mirrors the experience of playing a video game. The camera whips to each new target with the assurance of someone who knows all the combinations, and has instinctive, practiced access to every code and cheat. The only sign of conscious, unautomated humanity is the sound of the protagonist’s ragged breathing — an acknowledgment of the exhaustion that comes when a human being is pushed to become an action avatar.Such is the plight of Sook-hee (Kim Ok-bin), a trained assassin who is the focus of this convoluted thriller. After executing the movie’s opening slaughter, she is caught by the police and recruited as a sleeper agent by an intelligence agency, which promises her freedom following 10 years of service. As “The Villainess” jumps between Sook-hee’s past and present, it becomes clear that she is trapped in a dizzying world of violence, where neither law nor outlaws can be trusted. Yet despite her despair, every action scene is as queasily pristine as the first, leaving “The Villainess” caught in paradox. It’s hard to enjoy the action when you witness its emotional cost, but once Sook-hee starts slashing goons from atop motorcycles, it’s equally impossible to root for the violence to stop."

A reminder of puppy love can bring back wistful memories of a more innocent time before heartbreak. And that’s the feeling Manolo Caro’s latest movie, “Tales of an Immoral Couple,” tries to summon in its audience.As teenagers, Martina (Ximena Romo) and Lucio (Sebastián Aguirre) quickly went from friends to a passionate and experimental couple before they were torn apart by their scandalous expulsion from a Catholic school. When, after 25 years with no contact, Martina and Lucio (now played by Cecilia Suárez and Manuel García-Rulfo) run into each other on the streets of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, they swap elaborate stories of made-up families to prove that they hadn’t waited like fools to reconnect. Realizing they are both going to the same exhibition that night, each must find someone to pose as a spouse to pull off the ruse.Though the film successfully evokes feelings of first love, “Tales of an Immoral Couple” relies on a familiar formula: the story line of friends turning into lovers. Only, the movie isn’t concerned with that awkward dance toward a relationship. Instead, it delightfully bounces between the young students falling in love — then from grace — and the reluctance of their adult counterparts to express their feelings.Mr. Caro, who also wrote the script, favors the comedic potential of this couple’s situation and plays up the good humor with visual jokes, frivolous misadventures and upbeat pop rock music. The result is a sweet and affecting story, one that forgoes the awkward moments of teenage romance and offers the possibility of reliving a bit of our youthful amor — if just for the film’s 90-minute running time."

The rundown neighborhood is just far enough from the first sparks of the uprising that the characters can believe the flames and looting won’t reach them. The verdict of the Rodney King trial is on everyone’s minds, of course, but it exists, initially, in the background, on TV and radio broadcasts.Shot in black and white, the movie centers on two Korean-American brothers, Eli (Mr. Chon) and Daniel (David So), who run their dead father’s shoe store. Daniel dreams of becoming a rhythm-and-blues singer; Eli just wants to hold down the fort, although Daniel’s habit of giving discounts isn’t exactly helping them cover the rent. They spend the day goofing around with Kamilla (Simone Baker), an 11-year-old who, like them, has lost a parent.Though the characters don’t seem preoccupied with the day’s news, “Gook” captures the area’s racial tensions. The liquor store across from the shoe shop has a South Korean immigrant owner (Sang Chon, the director’s father) who makes a point of not speaking English, and fears that Kamilla will steal from him. Kamilla’s brother (Curtiss Cook Jr.) doesn’t trust Eli and Daniel.The movie owes a sizable debt to “Do the Right Thing,” both in its portrait of a community on the verge of violence and its use of music as a motif. (The opening, which appears to be foreshadowing, shows Kamilla dancing before a burning building; a lighthearted sequence depicts Kamilla, Eli and Daniel dancing to “Maneater.”)The film isn’t perfect — Mr. Chon’s wild camera motions seem more undisciplined than electric — but it does find an angle on the riots that hasn’t been seen much onscreen."

The lyric could also serve as an alternate title for “England Is Mine,” Mark Gill’s unauthorized and unrelentingly dour biopic of the early years of the group’s frontman, Steven Patrick Morrissey.Unfolding mainly in dingy rooms, whose cheap curtains barely obscure the miserable Manchester streets beyond, this doggedly unilluminating portrait opens in 1976 with the 17-year-old Morrissey (a game Jack Lowden) immersed in Oscar Wilde and the New York Dolls. Fulminating with contempt for England and disdain for the daily grind, he bangs out vitriolic screeds on an old typewriter, the confrontational prose at odds with his diffident manner. There is also a great deal of moping.With its bleak, yearning tone and defiantly cloudy color palette, “England Is Mine” has a pleasingly granular feel for its era and location. But its imagining of Morrissey as a self-pitying narcissist, a curiously passive intellectual who can’t get out of his own way, soaks the movie in a wearying inertia. While we’re all waiting for greatness to find him, though, three hardy women are around to nudge things along: A punkish artist (Jessica Brown Findlay), a hectoring best mate (Katherine Pearce) and his empathetic Mum (Simone Kirby), whose support for her sulky son never wavers.Skirting sexuality and absent Morrissey’s music (the movie ends in 1982 as he and Johnny Marr are on the brink of forming the band), “England Is Mine” is a soggy schlep. But if you’re among those who believe that great art rarely foments in the cheerfully well-adjusted, then this one’s for you."

The city is under attack, invaded not by a foreign or extraterrestrial army but by forces of secession from the southern United States. A young woman named Lucy (Brittany Snow), on her way to visit her grandmother, finds herself caught up in a new civil war.This is not a bad premise. The idea that regional and ideological divisions might erupt into violent conflict doesn’t seem entirely far-fetched these days, and low-budget genre movies can often generate more political insight than their prestige-minded Hollywood cousins. But while “Bushwick,” directed by Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott from a script by Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, offers reasonable technical competence — following shots that are as fluid and kinetic as expert video-game play — its storytelling is dimwitted and amateurish.Fleeing black-uniformed snipers and storm troopers, as well as opportunistic street criminals, Lucy teams up with a burly janitor named Stupe (Dave Bautista), and they zigzag through the neighborhood that gives the movie its title. The name once signified a working-class black and Latino part of New York, but lately it has become synonymous with the artisanal, post-collegiate culture of 21st-century Brooklyn.The filmmakers feign boldness in tackling national politics, but revert to coyness and caricature when it comes to local matters, gesturing toward a multiculturalism that isn’t even skin deep and sweeping gentrification under the rug. The civil war “Bushwick” imagines is mostly about white people, which kind of makes the movie a piece of historical revisionism about something that hasn’t even happened yet."

So tackling “Death Note,” the sprawling, gobsmackingly detailed Japanese manga series by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, is a ballsy move — even if you’re backed by Netflix. And for the director Adam Wingard, who needs a win after last year’s disappointing “Blair Witch” sequel, the prospect of riling those fans must have been especially daunting.Devotees of Mr. Wingard, on the other hand, will immediately recognize a sensibility — rare among horror-movie directors — that prioritizes mood over mayhem. From the dreamy opening to the flashback-heavy finale, the movie has a tone and temperament that are consistently his own. The sharply executed violence, jabs of humor and, in particular, a fascination with the seductiveness of evil (most pronounced in his 2014 feature, “The Guest”) are all here, albeit in a compressed package.Set in Seattle (played by Vancouver, British Columbia), the story centers on Light (Nat Wolff), a smart, isolated high schooler whose world is upended when an ancient, leather-bound notebook drops from the heavens. Inside are instructions: Picture the face and write the name of whomever you would like to kill, and that soul’s expiration is assured. A test run to eliminate a troublesome bully is spectacularly successful, and soon Light and his girlfriend, Mia (an underserved Margaret Qualley), are wiping out evildoers worldwide.Lurking in Light’s bedroom, however, is the actual killer: A mischievous Japanese death spirit named Ryuk (voiced with cackling relish by Willem Dafoe), who resembles a rotting tree trunk and behaves like an annoying goad. Yet this malevolent house pest is far less worrisome than L, a ninja-styled über-detective who is obsessively investigating the murders. As played by a mesmerizing Lakeith Stanfield, L is a twitchy oddity with an attentive handler (Paul Nakauchi) and a back story that deserves its own spinoff. Face half hidden beneath a black turtleneck, L crouches on chairs like an anime arachnid, sucking up candies and sniffing out clues.By far the more entertaining of the two mythically entwined antagonists, L zeros in on Light with eccentric speed. And that’s the problem: Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books, movies, television shows and a stage musical), “Death Note” feels rushed and constricted. As a result, what should have been Light’s incremental surrender to godlike power becomes an instantaneous embrace, and what ought to have played out as an extended manhunt is resolved with embarrassing ease.Cramming several tons of plot into a one-pound screenplay, the three writers (one of whom, Jeremy Slater, created Fox television’s thoughtful adaptation of “The Exorcist”) have little option but to condense. That said, Mr. Wingard’s eye for a stylish image hasn’t dimmed. Working with the cinematographer David Tattersall, he concocts sequences that tilt and drift, awash in neon and a soundtrack that evokes a woozy, winking romanticism. At certain moments, we can almost feel his desire to shrug off the straitjacket of fidelity and make this tale of false gods and flawed superheroes completely his own."

Janicza Bravo’s feature debut, written with her husband and its star, Brett Gelman, traffics in the same anti-humor as Rick Alverson’s “The Comedy” and “Entertainment,” knowingly titled movies that offer nothing of the sort. Give “Lemon” credit, then: It’s a case of truth in advertising.The movie opens with a woman on television recounting horrors in Africa, it seems, only to pivot to the viewer on the couch, something of a tragic case himself. Isaac (Mr. Gelman) is a failure in every respect: career, grooming and — we eventually discover — pet-sitting and bathroom hygiene. He appears in embarrassing ads. While working as an acting teacher, he pits two students (Gillian Jacobs and Michael Cera, sporting what looks like a rodent-chewed Art Garfunkel hairdo) against each other, perhaps for his amusement. Though he’s not laughing. After Mr. Cera’s character finds success, Isaac tags his car with a slur.Isaac is also in a floundering relationship with a blind woman (Judy Greer), who respects him almost as little as he does her. In a centerpiece of sorts, Isaac attends a Passover Seder at which his brother (Martin Starr) questions the Jewishness of their sister (Shiri Appleby) and her black son (Blake Anthony Crawford). You could cry anti-Semitism, but you’d be taking the bait; the movie calculates its ethnic stereotypes to offend and dares you not to be in on the gag.The protagonist eventually tiptoes toward functionality while wooing a woman (Nia Long) who, like Ms. Bravo, is black. At this point “Lemon” apparently becomes an inside joke about the filmmakers. (Mr. Gelman is Jewish.) The rampant self-loathing was just a ruse for narcissism."

As for the adults who’ll get dragged to the theater: You’ve seen it all before, though it’s pleasant enough to watch again.Beginning at a French orphanage sometime around the 1880s, this good-natured tale finds 11-year-old Félicie (voiced by Elle Fanning) and her friend Victor (Nat Wolff) ready to run away to Paris, where she hopes to become a ballerina and he an inventor. After this generic pair is chased by the orphanage overseer (Mel Brooks, criminally underused) they arrive in the big city.Félicie is the focus here, and soon she’s befriending Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen), a former dancer turned cleaning woman, and trying out for a prestigious ballet school as various villains conspire to quash her hopes. Along the way she is told to follow her dreams, to never give up and to take big risks.Those messages are delivered often, and emphasized, to inspire young viewers. Fair enough. Less justifiable is the hit-or-miss humor and a well-worn plotline. Panoramic images of Paris, dance sequences and montages of Félicie in training add some energy.Directed by Éric Summer and Éric Warin (and first released in Europe as “Ballerina,” sans that wanton exclamation point), “Leap!” remains peppy as it sets its bar at a low-to-medium height then cheerfully clears it. Sure, the movie could have heeded its own advice and taken a few risks. But the filmmakers know just what their younger audience wants — a sunny story and plenty of dancing — and they’re not taking any chances."

The watch belongs to Adam (Hany Adel), an Egyptian-born journalist who lives in America and is back in the country covering the unrest.The truck fills up with detainees of all ages, mostly men. Some side with the Muslim Brotherhood, others support the military that deposed Mr. Morsi. They all seem to hate the journalist. “An activist should die for a cause, not a photo,” one man sneers at Adam.He responds, “A photo can be a cause.”There isn’t much time for such “12 Angry Men” style exchanges as the movie goes on, though. The 20 or so occupants attempt to “strategize”; members of the Muslim Brotherhood try to segregate themselves from the others. One man suffers a head wound. A young woman tries to help him, only to be told that he can’t be touched by a woman. When the truck stops, a column of soldiers stands in front of the back door. Every time a detainee needs to relieve him or herself, an argument breaks out.Whatever affinities these characters have, they are practically obliterated as soon as they are established. Devotion to dogma and sheer perversity erodes their fellowship as day turns into night — after which “Clash” turns into a full-fledged horror movie, albeit one without the fake comfort of a supernatural or science-fiction pretext. It’s just man’s inhumanity to man, in full sway."

In the 1948 classic “The Red Shoes” even the most unpretty parts of the process were made beautiful. In “Black Swan” (2010) they were made — perhaps more accurately — mind-bendingly horrific.Adapted from Bastien Vivès’s graphic novel, “Polina” takes a largely straightforward and sometimes documentary-style approach in its depiction of a dancer’s life. The title character is first seen as a young girl in a Russian ballet school, dancing to her own beat on the way home from class. The teenage Polina, played in a confident, winning, lived-in performance by Anastasia Shevtsova (a real-life ballerina who trained with the Mariinsky Ballet), gets a shot at the Bolshoi, but breaks away from that to follow her artistic instincts. After leaving Russia for France, however, she fails to find her groove while working with a romantic partner under the guidance of a compassionate but stern contemporary dance choreographer (Juliette Binoche). Unmoored in Europe, she later regains some exuberance in Belgium with an improvisational troupe that takes inspiration from street life and electronic dance music.Enduring bruises, torn toenails and hard falls is only one part of a dancer’s day-to-day life. If this film’s directors, Valérie Müller and the French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, don’t offer much overt material on Polina’s inner life, it’s because they don’t have to: the point of Polina, and this movie, is that her dancing is her being."
"8559","Marjorie Prime","",1,"GLENN KENNY","Review: ‘Marjorie Prime’ and Jon Hamm: Ceaselessly Into the Past","Lois Smith reprises the role of Marjorie in Michael Almereyda’s adaptation of Jordan Harrison’s play weighing the morality of artificial intelligence.","2017-08-17",NA,"2017-11-02 04:16:44",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/movies/marjorie-prime-review-jon-hamm.html,Read the New York Times Review of Marjorie Prime,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/17/arts/18marjorie-WEB1/18marjorie-WEB1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Most fictions about artificial intelligence are not, of course, about artificial intelligence. They use the topic as a metaphor, a scale on which to weigh and measure the assets and liabilities of humanity itself. “Marjorie Prime,” a new film written and directed by Michael Almereyda, adapted from Jordan Harrison’s acclaimed play, is an alternately stately and brisk story in which the metaphor poses questions about mortality, loss and who our imagined “best selves” might turn out to actually be once they’re released from our own assessment.The great Lois Smith reprises the role she played in both the 2014 Los Angeles and 2015 New York productions of the play, an old woman named Marjorie with an unspecified disease who has been given a new companion. “He” is Walter, her dead husband, reincarnated in an in-his-prime version played by Jon Hamm.In his early interactions with Marjorie, Walter, a holographic-generated “prime” whose personality software is constructed both from what he left behind and from memories of the people close to him, is kind, solicitous and a little wide-eyed. Whenever Marjorie “reminds” him of a trait the actual Walter had, or a shared experience, his prime obediently says, “I’ll remember that now.” (The movie is set in an unspecified point in the future, though if you do the math around the video release of a movie that looms large in Walter and Marjorie’s early story, it would seem to be around 2050.)Marjorie’s daughter, Tess, has prickly feelings about having this Walter in the house, while her husband, Jon, is more optimistic about the digital ghost’s potential for service. As you might infer from the title, household roles subsequently shift, and then shift some more. The characters’ quiet desperation to hold on to the ones they’ve loved becomes a sort of trap.The movie has certain affinities with other recent critical favorites, but is less knotty than “Ex Machina” (2014) and less sentiment driven than “Her” (2013). It is not particularly concerned with gender roles or even tender feelings as such. Tim Robbins and Geena Davis, as Jon and Tess, play their characters with close-to-the-vest discipline, and Ms. Smith tempers Marjorie’s physical vulnerability with a wry skepticism.At one point, a character points out that whenever humans revisit a memory, they are not recollecting the actual event: rather they are remembering what they remember. In that respect, the extent to which our memories make up our selves is changing without us even realizing. The “primes” here don’t work that way. Or do they? And what difference does that make to their interaction with humans, and vice versa?Mr. Almereyda (whose 2015 film, “Experimenter,” was an underseen beauty) is a seasoned cinematic spellbinder. He doesn’t do much to open up Mr. Harrison’s theatrical work, confining it for the most part to an elegant, mysterious beach house, one that, paradoxically enough, contains no visible high-tech devices. When you try to break down how he achieves his seductive magic with respect to this narrative, it all looks, initially, like nothing more than good cinematic common sense. The key is what he does on the sly: the way his subtle shifts of focus within a shot don’t just change the emphasis of the scene, but mirror quirks of consciousness. There’s more going on in this movie’s 90-plus minutes than in many summer blockbusters nearly twice its length."

His prying questions and incessant voice-overs suggest a cross between a Fleet Street reporter and the Energizer Bunny.For better or worse, Mr. Broomfield’s sleazy style gives his documentaries personality. Thus, viewers of his conspiracy-minded films about the deaths of other stars (“Kurt and Courtney,” “Biggie and Tupac”) may feel duped by “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” a surprisingly conventional, dutifully respectful behind-the-scenes portrait of Whitney Houston’s rise and struggles with fame and drugs before her death at 48. (A competing Houston documentary has been announced.)As the movie intercuts testimonials from Ms. Houston’s friends, family and collaborators with footage from her 1999 tour — shot by Rudi Dolezal, who shares directing credit — Mr. Broomfield is heard only occasionally and never shown. We learn about the forces that weighed on the superstar singer, including the criticism she faced for embracing pop instead of rhythm and blues; speculation about her sexuality; and, in the movie’s telling, the feud between her husband, Bobby Brown, and Robyn Crawford, her friend and possible lover.Skillful editing of old interviews makes it difficult to keep track of who agreed to participate (and some songs, such as “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),” are noticeable by their absence). The most charged assertions come from Ms. Houston’s former bodyguard David Roberts, who says his warnings about the singer’s need for help went unheeded. In music documentaries, sadly, that sentiment is hardly unique."

A jury convicted two young men of the murder, one of whom, Colin Warner, had nothing to do with it. Nonetheless, Mr. Warner spent more than 20 years in prison until, thanks in large part to the tireless efforts of his friend Carl King (known as CK), his conviction was overturned and he was released.This story inspired a gripping, enraging episode of “This American Life,” and “Crown Heights,” written and directed by Matt Ruskin, tries to adhere both to the factual record and a careful, detail-focused documentary ethos. Like its protagonist, sensitively and shrewdly played by Lakeith Stanfield, the film is soft-spoken and thoughtful, with sweet, lyrical touches that alleviate some of the grimness without blunting the cruelty and injustice of what happened.On the day of the murder, as Colin and CK (Nnamdi Asomugha) go about their routines, “Crown Heights” quietly registers the texture of New York life in 1980. The crime and violence that were much more prevalent then than now, but also the daily rituals of love, family and work that never really change. Colin steals a car (for the chop shop where he works), flirts with a neighbor, Antoinette (Natalie Paul), and runs an errand for his grandmother. Then all of a sudden he’s in custody, and ensnared in a bureaucratic and penal nightmare. Months stretch into years, and while CK raises money, hires lawyers and pursues appeals, Colin, incarcerated at the New York state penitentiary in Dannemora, fights to stay sane, safe and hopeful.ImageMarsha Stephanie Blake and Nnamdi Asomugha in “Crown Heights.”CreditAmazon StudiosOur attention shifts back and forth between the two men, which provides narrative momentum at the cost of dramatic and psychological depth. CK’s devotion to the cause of his friend’s exoneration strains his marriage, and the long sequence of stalls and setbacks in court and in parole hearings erodes Colin’s morale. These developments are conveyed in scenes that feel a bit too pointed and familiar — effective in the moment but not quite as powerful as they might have been.But “Crown Heights” nonetheless makes a powerful argument that Colin’s imprisonment was hardly an anomaly. Mr. Ruskin cuts in news clips of several generations of politicians from both parties — including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and former New York Gov. George E. Pataki — making tough-on-crime speeches promising longer sentences, more executions and less parole. In the meantime, the kinds of policies they promote take their toll on Colin.Like countless other black men, he is ensnared in a system that seems rigged against him in every way. The police, the prosecutors, the prison guards and some of his own lawyers cut corners, rush to judgment and ignore the clear evidence of his innocence. You get the sense that they are part of a vast, shadowy, brutal machine, the illumination of which feels urgently necessary even as it lies outside the film’s scope.But the choice to focus on Colin rather than on his persecutors is an honorable and ethical one, and “Crown Heights” is a moving tribute to his resilience and the steadfastness of the people who love him."
"8580","Shot Caller","R",0,"BEN KENIGSBERG","Review: In ‘Shot Caller,’ Prison Hardens Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’s Character","A fatal drunken driving accident leads to a nightmarish term in prison that forges a criminal.","2017-08-17",NA,"2017-11-02 04:16:44",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/movies/shot-caller-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of Shot Caller,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/17/arts/18shotcaller-WEB1/18shotcaller-WEB1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140," “Shot Caller” is the third feature from Ric Roman Waugh (“Snitch,” “Felon”) to illustrate the notion that prisons make criminals instead of reforming them. Once a man is institutionalized, a character in “Shot Caller” says, “anything is possible.”To prove that thesis, “Shot Caller” stretches “anything” well beyond credulity. Involving yet trivializing, the movie unfolds as a would-be “Breaking Bad” of the prison genre, following an inadvertent criminal who is hardened by a gangland behind bars and eventually becomes one of its cleverest members.Before incarceration, Jacob Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, from “Game of Thrones”) is a stockbroker from Pasadena. When he’s arrested after a fatal drunken-driving accident, concomitant charges and sentencing guidelines leave him in a bind that sends him to prison for far longer than he and his wife (Lake Bell) anticipated. Once there, he falls under the protection of a white-power gang; proves his cred by murdering a snitch; and meets the Beast (Holt McCallany), a prison leader who spouts aphorisms (“a warrior’s deadliest weapon is his mind”) and who supposedly runs California from his open-air cage.“Shot Caller” interweaves before-and-after timelines, toggling between Jacob’s initiation and his life after release, a decade later, as a tattooed, muscular ex-con plotting an arms deal. Both the prison and the gangs have rules, Jacob says, but the gangs’ rules matter. “Shot Caller” effectively conveys the vise grip of Jacob’s options, but that doesn’t make it less ludicrous from scene to scene."

(The unrelated Iran hostage crisis was unfolding in Tehran at the time.)From a structural standpoint, what is interesting about this dramatization of events is that it only occasionally strays from the vantage points of those on the outside. That puts the viewer in the shoes of the government officials and other onlookers as they weigh various options — loading the hostage-takers onto a bus to Heathrow Airport and raiding the bus, entering the embassy through a skylight — for ending the situation.The factions are accorded one major actor apiece: Mark Strong is an inspector with a police negotiations team, Abbie Cornish is a BBC News reporter, Jamie Bell is a member of Britain’s Special Air Service and Tim Pigott-Smith (who died in April) is William Whitelaw, Britain’s home secretary. Over the phone, Mr. Strong’s character builds trust with the gunmen’s leader (Ben Turner). The last thread most compels the director, Toa Fraser, to violate the strictures on perspective.With a barrage of title-card identifications, “6 Days” can feel closer to a re-enactment than a thriller. To the extent that the movie has a political angle, it’s perhaps gratuitously jingoistic. A closing note that the captors “lie in unmarked graves in East London” seems out of step with what precedes it."

And if “Sidemen: Long Road to Glory” is to be believed, most of those highways converge on three bluesmen in particular: the drummer Willie Smith, the guitarist Hubert Sumlin and the pianist Joe Willie Perkins, known as Pinetop.Germinating and shape-shifting for almost a decade, Scott Rosenbaum’s loving tribute (originally conceived in 2008 as a “Last Waltz”-style concert film) pulls back the big-name curtain to celebrate these often overlooked backing musicians whose riffs and runs are revered to this day. As proof, a slew of sunken-eyed rock legends — including Johnny Winter, Gregg Allman, Keith Richards and Joe Perry — is on hand to share memories of the men and attest to their lasting influence.But “Sidemen” is about more than just legacy. Blessed with extensive interviews with their buoyant subjects (all three of whom died in 2011 within months of one another), Mr. Rosenbaum and his producer Jasin Cadic shape a narrative of professional insecurity and personal resilience. From playing brothels and juke joints in the Jim Crow South to decades-long collaborations with the Chicago blues pioneers Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, the three weathered careers of astonishing flux.Their stories are inseparable from that of the blues itself, which the filmmakers illustrate with a wealth of clips and concert footage reaching back more than half a century. The kids who thrilled to the Rolling Stones performing “Little Red Rooster” (the first blues song to reach No. 1 on the British charts), or watched Jimi Hendrix kill “Killing Floor,” probably knew nothing of Wolf and Waters. They just knew what they liked."

When you feel like freaking out, the movie’s commitment to slowing down and drawing inward doesn’t seem like such a bad idea.Maintaining a respectful, purely observational approach, the directors Max Pugh and Marc J. Francis introduce us to Plum Village, a community of Zen Buddhists in rural France. Here, life moves at a snail’s pace: Walking or eating, cooking or contemplating the words of their Vietnamese teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh — many of which are supplied in voice-over by the seductive, milk-and-honey baritone of Benedict Cumberbatch — the nuns and monks dawdle contentedly. A fleeting admission of boredom is met with beatific smiles, and the most lively debate occurs over which stick might best be used to beat a drum.Forced into exile in 1966 over his opposition to the Vietnam War, Thich Nhat Hanh, now 90, is credited with introducing the practice of mindfulness to welcoming Westerners. Yet the film supplies little in the way of background or history, either of the serene, anonymous faces that float across the frame or of the achievements of their celebrated Zen master. Instead, we’re dipped in and out of random rituals and events (including a 2011 teaching tour) without benefit of dates, locations or explanations.Sometimes dreamy but mostly dissatisfying, “Walk With Me” offers no clarity for the curious. We can enjoy the meditative mood, but understanding its underpinnings would require more than this idyll of silence and stillness provides."

It’s a universal religion, bringing the promise of grace and salvation into an otherwise drab existence. With a head full of bling-spangled reveries and a notebook full of rhymes, Patti (to use her most common nickname) hones her skills and indulges her dreams with her friend Hareesh (Siddharth Dhananjay), a pharmacist whose nom de mike is Jheri.“Patti Cake$,” Geremy Jasper’s big-hearted and astute debut film — he wrote, directed and composed the songs that make Patti and Jheri’s aspirations plausible — could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways. The story of a white suburban redhead chasing hip-hop glory may set off alarms about cultural appropriation, but the film mostly disarms them, or mixes them into the soundtrack. “Why don’t you act your age?” Patti asks her mother, Barb (Bridget Everett), an almost-was wannabe stuck in her own rock ’n’ roll fantasies. “Why don’t you act your race?” is Barb’s barbed retort.Mother and daughter could easily have been figures of mockery. It’s silly of Patti to imagine that she could be the next Nicki Minaj, and pathetic that Barb belts out old radio hits at karaoke. A lot of people in the movie make fun of the Dombrowski women, Patti in particular. Since middle school, she’s been known as Dumbo, and when she enters into an impromptu rap battle with a guy who works at the local pizza place, his rhymes are full of fat-shaming and sexual humiliation. She gives back as good as she gets, and the film, rather than join in the ridicule, registers its cruelty.But we’re not invited to feel sorry for her either. In structure and attitude, “Patti Cake$” adheres to a template familiar to readers of young adult fiction, blending realism with gentle but unmistakable messages of encouragement. It tells the story of a band of young misfits asserting themselves in a world that refuses to see their value. Jheri and Patti find a beat wizard (and Patti finds a romantic interest) in the person of a taciturn African-American punk rocker (Mamoudou Athie) who lives in a shack near the cemetery and goes by the name of Basterd. The three of them, now called PBNJ, start cutting tracks and planning their assault on the big time. It’s impossible not to root for them.The older generation comes in for harsher treatment. Wayward parents are a staple of the genre, and Barb wouldn’t place high in a mother-of-the-year contest, but Ms. Everett, a popular cabaret performer and a brilliant actress, endows her with dignity even at her worst. Patti’s grandmother (Cathy Moriarty) gives her more support and earns more sympathy, and also serves as a kind of guarantor of her granddaughter’s decency and ultimate safety. There will be tears, embarrassment and disappointment, but we’re not here to be miserable.And Ms. Macdonald is quite simply a revelation, capturing the reflexive self-confidence and defensive diffidence of the millennial generation with sneaky sincerity and offhand wit. Though it is expressively shot and crisply edited, the credibility of “Patti Cake$” ultimately rests on her shoulders. We have to believe that Patti is talented, and also that the odds are not in her favor. “It’s a cold world out there,” she’s told by her favorite D.J. (played by MC Lyte), and for us to savor the sweetness of Patti’s creativity we need to feel that chill.Mr. Jasper at once finds a new variation on a central hip-hop theme and gives a hip-hop inflection to a durable show-business-movie convention. As long as there are underdogs and misunderstood kids fighting to be noticed (and paid), there will be stories like this one, walking the line between cliché and classic with grit, conviction and just enough cynicism to keep things from getting too corny."

It’s really about how we create art.Sinking into a dedicated — and overwhelmingly male — subculture of enthusiasts, the director Doug Nichol unearths a trove of reasons for loving the clicketyclacking machine. The playwright and actor Sam Shepard (who died last month) confesses an addiction to the percussive sound of thoughts striking paper. Tom Hanks, an avid collector who owns around 250 machines and types almost daily, declares that he hates emailed thank-you notes and simply deletes them. Take note, sycophants and star-stalkers.More substantively, the musician John Mayer and the historian David McCullough speak eloquently of the need for tangible proof of creation versus the ephemeral nature of digital data. Denied diaries, letters or first drafts — whether of songs or presidential speeches — future historians will find it much harder to plumb the minds of the famous.Overlong and poorly annotated (interviewees are not identified until the end, and even then without photographs), “California Typewriter” fields plenty of thinkers, but it’s the fringe folks who entertain. Like the sculptor Jeremy Mayer, who — inspired by multiple viewings of “Metropolis” — transforms irreparable machines into fantastic beasts and life-size figures. Or the self-described typewriter poet, Silvi Alcivar, who composes impromptu stanzas for any occasion and for people who just need cheering up.As an alternative, those clients could slip into a performance by the delightful members of the Boston Typewriter Orchestra. They’re currently working on a cover of Slayer’s “Raining Blood.”"

In a land of winners and losers, where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful, we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars.“Logan Lucky,” Steven Soderbergh’s gravity-defying, ridiculously entertaining new film — one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing — concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It’s a caper movie, a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate, improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran, an unemployed former coal miner, a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them, and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up.That description might make the movie sound more pointed than it is. But Mr. Soderbergh’s class consciousness — something that has popped up often in his career, in “Erin Brockovich” and “The Girlfriend Experience,” in “Bubble” and, of course, in “Magic Mike” — is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in “Logan Lucky” utters a political word, but the setting carries a heavy, obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud, hard-pressed residents of West Virginia, a state that, in the real world, punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film’s anthem is John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one.Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), who plays the song for his young daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), while they work on his pickup truck, knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers, he says, had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (“Logan Lucky,” it should probably be pointed out, was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment, and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low, he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty, downbeat realism of ’70s New Hollywood than from that decade’s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the “Oceans” series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger, “Logan Lucky” revives the irreverent, hell-raising outlaw vibe of “Smokey and the Bandit.”Not that this movie feels in any way like a throwback. Mr. Tatum is about 10 times sexier than Burt Reynolds ever was, and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in “Step Up” and “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints”), it’s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer, but by now it should be clear that he’s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream, of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture, to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty.Stream These Great Steven Soderbergh Movies“Logan Lucky” is Steven Soderbergh’s first feature film in over four years — but before that, he was one of cinema’s most versatile filmmakers.Aug. 16, 2017Jimmy, once a high school football star, has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina, he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy’s brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq, thinks the family is cursed. Jimmy doesn’t share this superstition, and in any case he has a plan, or at least a how-to list for bank robbers that he decides to adapt for new circumstances.Like George Clooney’s Danny Ocean, he needs, first of all, to put together a crew. Starting with Clyde and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), Jimmy taps into another kinship network, recruiting an explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). That’s not quite everyone, but there are some dandy little surprises in store that I’m not inclined to spoil.Not that the plot is anything earth-shakingly original. “Logan Lucky” sticks to the “Oceans” template so faithfully that someone makes a joke about it. Who cares? The pleasures of the heist genre are always procedural and specific. These movies are all the same, but also always different because of the particular mix of personalities and circumstances. What they celebrate, above all, is the combination of craft, planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are, in other words, the quintessential movie movies, reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle.For that reason, a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one’s narrative engine hums along nicely, occasionally accelerating into farce, usually when Mr. Craig shows up, sporting neck tattoos, spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map, but let’s not get too hung up on authenticity.)Mr. Soderbergh never speeds through the twists and bumps. He downshifts and pulls onto the shoulder, letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny, sometimes fractious, sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters’ company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank’s F.B.I. agent, or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane, you feel like you’re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin.Of the three movies released this summer that self-consciously reactivate an old-school outlaw mythology — the others are Edgar Wright’s “Baby Driver” and Josh and Benny Safdie’s “Good Time” — this one has the most to say and the least to prove. Whereas the other directors aggressively promote their own coolness, flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles, Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. “Logan Lucky” is a terrific movie. That’s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck. But mostly it’s a matter of generosity."

He has said that this script sat dormant for 45 years. Realizing such a long-deferred passion project would be an accomplishment for anyone. Still, it’s hard to ignore that the harshly lit digital cinematography and the acting styles seem wildly out of step with the period, or that Mr. Sanders often clumsily frames his shots — with his lens in his performers’ faces — to hide contemporary backdrops.“Liza, Liza” is mostly so familiar — a standard teenage-lovers-on-the-lam tale — that it could have been set anywhere. With her boyfriend, Brett (Sean H. Scully), about to move East, Liza (Mikey Madison) runs away with him on a motorcycle trip up Big Sur. There are some signs of the times, including a druggy love-in, references to the draft, a roving gang of vaguely Mansonish thugs and a repeated Buffy Sainte-Marie song. But the question of whether the couple will consummate their relationship isn’t a sufficient source of tension."

In “Queen,” an opening montage evoking newsreels describes Franco’s invitation to American studios to shoot in Spain.Penélope Cruz, who also starred in “The Girl of Your Dreams,” is back as Macarena Granada, now a Hollywood superstar who, having acquired American citizenship, returns to her native Spain for a lavish American-Spanish coproduction about Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand.

Jackson is the hit man. Ryan Reynolds is the bodyguard. What more do you want me to say? These two sometime residents of different branches of the greater Marvel cosmos — Nick Fury and Deadpool, if you need reminding — join up, with ostentatious reluctance, on a European jaunt, leaving a trail of dead minions and flummoxed law enforcement officers from Manchester to The Hague. Their common nemesis is an Eastern European despot, a genocidal maniac with a scholarly mien and personal touch played, it seems almost redundant to point out, by Gary Oldman.“The Hitman’s Bodyguard,” directed by Patrick Hughes (“The Expendables 3”) and written by Tom O’Connor, is not a good movie, but, in fairness, it doesn’t try to be. It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star-paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension. The stars banter and bicker and wax sentimental about the badass women in their lives (Salma Hayek and Élodie Yung) until the time arrives for the next shootout or car chase or suite of explosions.These range from tedious to wildly overblown to kind of fun. A hot pursuit in and along the canals of Amsterdam — with Mr. Jackson in a speedboat, Mr. Reynolds on a motorbike and the bad guys in black cars — brings a few jolts and gasps, even if the digital seams in the sequence peek out intermittently. A bout of tool-assisted hand-to-hand combat in a hardware store makes up in efficiency for what it lacks in originality. The final blowup and showdown destroy whatever sense of proportion the movie might have had, along with a lot of Dutch infrastructure.Mr. Jackson plays Darius Kincaid, a fearsome contract killer cooperating with the authorities to free his wife (Ms. Hayek) from prison. Mr. Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a formerly “triple-A”-rated security specialist whose career and relationship (with Ms. Yung’s Interpol agent) went south after he lost a client. One of these fellows is an uptight, cautious, detail-oriented professional, while the other has a looser, more improvisational style. No points for guessing which is which, or for predicting who learns what from whom.Darius, despite a résumé piled high with dead and maimed bodies, is more righteous avenger than sociopath. This, too, is no surprise. A least since “Pulp Fiction,” Mr. Jackson has made a specialty of playing murderers touched by a curious sense of moral grace. Mr. Reynolds, for his part, is comfortable and credible as a smart, suave young punk in need of a bit of schooling. Mr. Jackson lays claim to most of the good lines and the big scenes, but no one can complain about that.Michael, however, does object to Darius’s reliance on a certain 12-letter expletive. “You ruined it,” he whines, supplying this otherwise blunt, none-too-clever movie with a morsel of meta-humor. Every movie fan knows that Mr. Jackson didn’t exactly invent that multifaceted word, but in its modern phraseology, he is nonetheless something of a mythic figure."

The taciturn Xolani (Nakhane Touré) is charged with looking after a sullen boy named Kwanda (Niza Jay Ncoyini). He’s also hooking up on the sly with Vija (Bongile Mantsai), another male caretaker with a wife and children back home. The campfire conversations of blustery teenagers and chest-puffing elders contrast with the shame and rage of Xolani, who is not out, and Vija, who is leading a double life. As it happens, Kwanda isn’t having it. He’s relatively comfortable with his sexuality and disgusted by Xolani, whom he sees as a hypocrite for having an affair with a married man.Mr. Trengove shoots the film in intimate wide-screen, getting in close to the characters as they tamp down explosive feelings, often letting the spectacular landscapes break down into soft-focus abstractions. His direction is perfectly judged up to and including the shudder-inducing ending."

The film’s meanspirited tone picks on both creatures and humans, like construction workers for being illiterate, animals almost too dumb to survive and the wicked rich.Apart from Mr. Arnett’s Surly, no other animal gets more than a few scraps of screen time, including Jackie Chan as the leader of a Chinatown mice gang and Bobby Cannavale as a dimwitted pup. Surly’s relationship with his love interest, Andie (Katherine Heigl), plays out like a Goofus and Gallant comic strip in which he does things the easy way while she moralizes about the importance of hard work and coddles Surly through his tantrums.The director Cal Brunker, previously a storyboard artist for “Despicable Me,” does not bring the warmth of that movie to this effort. Mr. Brunker, who wrote the script with five other people, fashions “Nut Job 2” as its own dull amusement park ride, where slapdash animation, a dismal story and a score by Heitor Pereira repeated ad infinitum makes for few thrills."

In 1986, Voyager 2 reached Uranus, and three years later Neptune. In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to exit our solar system and enter interstellar space, from which it still sends signals. (Voyager 2 is en route.)The accounts of scientists, whose enthusiasm still glows, is as wondrous as the technology seen here. Linda Morabito, a navigation engineer, recalls discovering gas plumes on Jupiter’s moon Io. “I had the first evidence of active volcanism beyond Earth,” she says, beaming. Time-lapse Voyager-eye views of planets as they get nearer convey a sense of the epiphanies experienced in mission control.And there is catnip for dreamers, in the form of the so-called golden record enclosed on both vessels. “A message in a bottle into the ocean,” says Jim Bell, author of “The Interstellar Age” — and to alien life-forms that might find it. Each disc (complete with instructions) includes, among other things, photos; diagrams; greetings in 53 languages; 27 pieces of music from different cultures, including “Johnny B. Goode”; and the song of a humpback whale.“We did something really, really great,” Brad Smith, an imaging specialist, says of the 40-year adventure.

If, that is, politically motivated shootings and bombings in big cities were fantastical tropes or metaphorical conceits, like zombie epidemics or extraterrestrial invasions. But perhaps “interesting” is too strong a word. Without a real-world correlative for the actions it depicts, Bertrand Bonello’s new film would merely be tedious and pretentious rather than repellent.There is no denying that Mr. Bonello, whose previous films include “House of Pleasures” (a prurient peek behind the scenes at an early-20th-century bordello) and “Saint Laurent” (a salacious tour of ’70s couture), possesses cinematic skill and suavity to spare. The story told in “Nocturama” splits neatly into before and after, with a few flashbacks thrown in for clarity and variety. The first half follows a collection of young French people as they prepare to carry out a series of attacks in Paris; the second stays with them in the immediate aftermath, as they kill time in a high-end department store.Part 1 is fast-moving and suspenseful, Part 2 languorous and luxuriant. The young terrorists are brisk and businesslike until the plastic explosives detonate. Then they act out a parody of jaded consumerist hedonism, browsing among the brand names. Nike, Fendi, Issey Miyake — Mr. Bonello places the products so lovingly in the frame that you might think he was being paid to do it.Really, though, all he advertises is the vacuity of his imagination, which he mistakes for the moral emptiness of his characters and the society that spawned them. They are not — or not all — drawn from its margins or its oppressed groups. A few of the conspirators (there are eight in all, plus an inside man at the store) seem to be children of immigrants from suburban housing projects. The others come from France’s middle and upper classes. One of the leaders is a student at an elite university, with family connections to the minister of the interior, whose office is among the group’s targets.Other targets include the chief executive of a bank, a row of parked cars, a gilded equestrian statue and a skyscraper with the word “global” conveniently displayed near its crown. The cause that motivates this violence is never specified. One member of the gang is a Muslim who doesn’t drink alcohol and believes he will be welcomed in paradise as a martyr, but religious extremism doesn’t seem to be part of the overall agenda. Nor does any recognizable political ideology or economic grievance. “It was bound to happen,” a bored-sounding young woman says to a perpetrator who has wandered out for a cigarette.Her fatalism mirrors the nihilism behind the act, and also the chilly abstraction that characterizes Mr. Bonello’s approach to a potentially volatile subject. As they try on fancy clothes and fiddle with wide-screen televisions and top-of-the-line sound equipment, the young rebels prove themselves to be perfect citizens of the system they supposedly hate. They don’t really want to overthrow it or force it to change, but rather to make some noise, to feel as if they’ve done something.An older generation of French radicals used to speak of the “propaganda of the deed” — the idea that violent or disruptive action can function as a vehicle of political meaning. Today’s terrorists are partly the inheritors of this notion, sending dramatic, lethal messages to enemies and sympathizers alike. For Mr. Bonello’s cadre of good-looking militants, deeds are more like marketing slogans, expressions of a free-floating aesthetic of tedium and mild stimulation.He treats them with a mixture of solicitude and detachment that reveals its cruelty by degrees. The closer they come to their inevitable bloody end, the more human these mixed-up kids appear. We learn their names, and see evidence of tenderness and folly as well as steely heartlessness. They’re so normal! But that revelation is really just confirmation of Mr. Bonello’s shallow cynicism, his facile conviction that he has built a trap for the audience’s conscience rather than a useless, self-consuming artifact. When the ruthless, faceless power of the state finally asserts itself, what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug. What took so long? There’s nothing political about that response: Like “Nocturama,” it’s nothing but an expression of aesthetic ennui."

As W. F., an alcoholic author with a mysterious connection to the movie’s nebbishy hero, Thomas (Callum Turner), Mr. Bridges slips delightedly into the kind of arrogant-artist role he perfected in “The Door in the Floor” (2004). Here, his character is more grimy and less lustful, but no less certain of his own rectitude.Washing up in Thomas’s Lower East Side apartment building, W. F. quickly becomes the young man’s literary life coach. Heaven knows he needs one: An aspiring writer who equates rebellion with a downscale ZIP code and a whining contempt for the financial success of his father, Ethan (Pierce Brosnan), Thomas moons over a gorgeous young woman (Kiersey Clemons) and frets over his emotionally fragile mother (a warm Cynthia Nixon). He probably also needs a therapist, preferably a Freudian, to unravel why he’s obsessively stalking his father’s mistress, Johanna (Kate Beckinsale).Burdened by thuddingly obvious musical choices (including Simon & Garfunkel’s gorgeous title song and, for crying out loud, Dylan’s “Visions of Johanna”), Allan Loeb’s script is glib and grating. The way is cleared for W. F., with his aura of slovenly glamour and precise knowledge of the cooking temperature of heroin, to steal the show. But Mr. Turner holds his own, gamely countering his strong resemblance to the young Richard Gere with a performance of perplexed immaturity.Everyone, in fact, works hard to transcend the artifice, and they deserve better. So, for that matter, do Simon & Garfunkel."

Should this trend continue, we could very well see one of Annabelle’s ancestors causing catastrophic delays in the building of the pyramids.For now, though, we’re in the 1940s as a doll maker and his wife (Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto) suffer the loss of their beloved daughter. A dozen years later, he’s a shuffling shell and she’s a disfigured recluse; so they open their rambling California farmhouse to a young nun and a clutch of orphaned girls. Wake up, Annabelle, your victims are here! Might I suggest you begin with the little one with the leg brace?And so she does, terrorizing the youngsters in cheekily effective scenes while their host hovers ineffectually on the fringes and his wife cowers behind her bed curtains. Gary Dauberman’s script is lamentably light on mythological details (can the demon survive indefinitely outside the doll, or does it have a curfew?), but its vacuousness allows the director, David F. Sandberg, to string together jolts any way he pleases.As with last year’s “Lights Out,” he proves a master of the flash-scare, a nifty choreographer of precipitous timing and striptease visuals. But he’s also adroit with more leisurely horrors, like the snap-crackle-pop of the murderous shade flexing for the kill, or the slow animation of a sacklike scarecrow into a toothy obscenity.In this kind of horror movie, no one ever seems to hear you scream."

That way, the therapeutic calm instilled by the glorious Iberian scenery (photographed by James Clarke in shimmering, almost edible pastels) could be savored uninterrupted by the performative patter of the two stars, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. I imagine that the diners seated near them in the restaurants where much of this movie takes place would have been grateful for mute buttons of their own.Like “The Trip” in 2011 and “The Trip to Italy” three years later, this latest cushy assignment sends the lads — once again playing Steve and Rob, mildly fictionalized versions of themselves — tootling around a randomly chosen region, sampling menus and trading banter. I hesitate to say jokes, because, unlike the bounce and zing of the first movie, the tone here is more sober and the humor more strained. Barely squeaking by on a familiar formula and flimsy narrative (Steve is writing a book; Rob is scribbling restaurant reviews for The New York Times), the actors convey a sense of going through the motions. Eating sumptuous meals without apparent relish, jogging separately through impossibly gorgeous towns, and firing off celebrity impersonations with wearying one-upmanship, they perform with the competitive reflexivity of the longtime double act.Yet even artists as gifted as these two can only hitchhike so long on the charisma of household names like Mick Jagger and Michael Caine, and the dueling impressions that fuel the franchise have become effortful and repetitive. (One extended bit on Roger Moore is tortured to the point of desperation.) And though the spaces between the funny voices are filled with verdant hillsides and vanilla beaches that stretch the length of the frame, there’s an occasional sour edge to the comedic sparring.This comes almost entirely from Steve, whose midlife anxieties — including an elusive, married lover and a neglectful agent — are the burr under the movie’s saddle. Plagued by disturbing dreams and career frustrations, he becomes increasingly distracted and crabby, until every comic utterance feels like a shot across the bow of mortality. This poignancy makes the picture less humorous but potentially more substantive than its predecessors. And as the men imagine themselves Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (daftly abetted by Noel Harrison’s 1960s hit “The Windmills of Your Mind”), the film’s failure to engage with these discomforts feels like a missed opportunity.Instead, Mr. Winterbottom and his team — by means of an extremely strange ending — appear to be setting us up for a Trip to Morocco. Sorry, guys, but that one’s already been done."

It’s unusual to see such excellence in costumes, sets and cinematography lavished on this degree of narrative muddle.Written by the director, Rebecca Zlotowski, and Robin Campillo — of “The Class” and “BPM (Beats Per Minute),” a recent Cannes prizewinner — this film, mostly set in the 1930s, stars Natalie Portman and Lily-Rose Depp as Laura and Kate Barlow, a spiritualist sister act from the United States. On the Paris stop of their European tour, they give a private séance to a film producer, André Korben (Emmanuel Salinger). As Laura notices, his accent suggests he isn’t from France originally. (Ms. Portman speaks many of her lines in what sounds like credible French.)André becomes eager to film the mediums at work, with the hope of recording evidence of a spectral presence. (And to paraphrase a professor in the film, cinema — even without actual wraiths — is an invention that captures the ghosts of the future.) André also offers the sisters residence in his home, in an arrangement fraught with class tension.But much of what happens next — romance, illness — seems arbitrary, as characters come and go without proper introductions. Tidiness isn’t crucial, but watching “Planetarium” often feels like making contact with fragments of a great three-hour movie."

Its directors, Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis, are novice filmmakers, true; but I also suspect this movie’s form is deliberate, part of its message. This is direct and frequently powerful filmmaking that doesn’t much care about meeting my aesthetic standards.“Whose Streets?” takes off from the night Mr. Brown was shot. One of the movie’s subjects is David Whitt, a resident of the apartment complex on the street where the shooting took place, who is moved to take his video camera onto the streets to record police action as rioting started. Another thread follows Brittany Ferrell and Alexis Templeton, a couple navigating parenthood and school, and putting themselves at considerable risk as they lead and participate in demonstrations like one in which they formed a human chain to block traffic on a highway.The movie is punctuated with quotes by black historical figures — Martin Luther King Jr.’s observation that “a riot is the language of the unheard” is particularly resonant. Much of the footage is from low-resolution video cameras and cellphones; the most professional-looking material here is from a television interview with Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, in which he says, “You can’t perform the duties of a police officer and have racism in you.” This is shown in the same section that features on-the-fly shots of off-duty St. Louis police officers puffing their chests at activists at a town hall meeting. Another wrenching scene shows a protester trying to address a black female officer, the only person of color in a defensive line of cops; she holds her position even as tears fill her eyes."

SCOTT","Review: A ‘Good Time,’ if in Name Only","Robert Pattinson plays a not-too-bright bank robber on the run in Josh and Benny Safdie’s latest film, “Good Time.”","2017-08-10","2017-08-11","2017-11-02 04:18:28",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/movies/good-time-review-robert-pattinson.html,Read the New York Times Review of Good Time,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/11/arts/11goodtime-web01/11goodtime-web01-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Nick and Connie Nikas are brothers, like Josh and Benny Safdie, the directors of “Good Time.” Nick — played by Benny Safdie — is mentally disabled, while Connie (Robert Pattinson) might charitably be described as an idiot. Motivated by a volatile mix of desperation and bravado, he involves Nick in a poorly planned, haphazardly executed bank robbery. You can bet money on a disastrous outcome, though you might not foresee the precise sequence of mayhem and farce that unfolds on the streets of Queens over a single freezing night. The caper includes an after-hours visit to an amusement park, a soda bottle full of LSD, a case of mistaken identity and plenty of chases, beatings and narrow escapes.The Safdies are as clever and crafty as Connie is inept and impulsive. “Good Time,” their third co-directed fictional feature — after the autobiographical “Daddy Longlegs” and the addiction romance “Heaven Knows What” — moves smartly and propulsively to the stressed-out strains of Daniel Lopatin’s edge-of-a-heart-attack score. The smudgy, grimy urban landscape — emergency rooms, fast-food restaurants, blocks of modest, over-mortgaged, squeezed-together houses — is shot (by Sean Price Williams) with a fastidious avoidance of prettiness. The story doesn’t twist and turn so much as squirm and jump like an eel in the bottom of a rowboat. The biggest surprises confirm what an unbelievable slimeball Connie is. He’s about as hard to root for as any movie outlaw you can think of.And yet, partly because Mr. Pattinson’s movie-star incandescence can’t quite be obscured by facial hair and bad lighting, and partly because of the immutable laws of genre and spectacle, you sort of have no choice but to root for him. You’re stuck with him, and you might as well make the best of it. The Safdies have explored this kind of ambiguity before. In “Daddy Longlegs,” the wayward father, played by Ronald Bronstein (a character based on their own father), was appalling and charming in almost equal measure; his charisma both enabled and camouflaged his wanton irresponsibility. You might have recoiled in horror at his recklessness, but you couldn’t deny that he loved his kids.Connie, for his part, adores his brother and has a way with dogs. While these traits don’t exactly make him likable, they grant him a minimal benefit of the doubt. His manipulation of his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) isn’t nice, but on the other hand she is so whiny and needy that you can’t feel too bad. Connie also has the good luck (at least as far as the audience’s good graces are concerned) of falling in with the one guy in Queens who could make him look like a criminal genius — a gangly doofus named Ray (Buddy Duress), who has been spending his first days out of jail aggressively pursuing the opposite of rehabilitation.This pair is not exactly Butch and Sundance, even in their own addled, delusional minds. And while Ray is hapless and almost heroically stupid, Connie is a more complicated, less clownish figure. He has a hint of heart, as well as a cruel, predatory streak that the Safdies’ expose for shocks and laughs, daring you to either take offense or take the joke, and banking on your queasiness in either case.It doesn’t take much looking to notice an ugly racial dimension in Connie’s behavior, though most critics overlooked it when the film was shown in Cannes this spring. When the Nikas brothers carry out the bank job, they wear hard hats, reflective vests and dark latex masks that function as crude, criminal blackface. Later, Connie takes advantage of a Caribbean immigrant (Gladys Mathon) and her granddaughter (Taliah Lennice Webster), sweet-talking and bullying them into aiding and abetting him. A black security guard (Barkhad Abdi) becomes another brutally abused pawn in Connie’s senseless game.This pattern does not seem accidental. The question is what it means — what degree of self-consciousness or critical distance “Good Time” brings to its depiction of bottom-of-the-barrel white privilege. You could infer a satirical dimension if you wanted to, or even a righteous indictment of what a lowlife can get away with if he has Mr. Pattinson’s complexion. Or you could look at the film’s riot of racial signifiers — the musical and pop-cultural references as well as the demographics of the setting — as a form of trolling, a coy, self-disavowing provocation.But the distinction doesn’t really matter, since the movie’s chief investment is not in the fates of any of its characters, nor in anything like realism, but rather in its own cool. Sometimes it flaunts its clichés — Nick’s disability, and Benny Safdie’s slack-jawed portrayal of it, is a big one — and other times it cloaks them in rough visual textures and jumpy, bumpy camera movements, so that a rickety genre thrill ride feels like something daring and new. It isn’t. It’s stale, empty and cold."

It turns out the bride wasn’t a friend, but merely encouraged Ingrid by commenting on one of her posts.Ingrid’s next fixation is Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), a social media gadfly. To get close to her, Ingrid moves to Los Angeles, visits a restaurant that Taylor has praised (repeating her order) and abducts Taylor’s dog as a pretext for returning it. As the two become besties, the movie makes the not-revelatory point that Taylor’s stage-managed life — including her dream of opening a boutique (“my Instagram, but in real life”) — is barely less fraudulent than Ingrid’s.Ms. Plaza is a whiz with timing and does a deft job of shifting viewers’ sympathy; her character can be loathsome or pathetic depending on the scene. O’Shea Jackson Jr., as her Batman-obsessed landlord, is every bit as funny and nearly walks away with the movie. Still, Mr. Spicer cops out by going with the obvious ending. Admittedly, he has tough competition. Real life already gave social media “influencers” a far more cutting sendup. It was called Fyre Fest."

The plot has a factual basis: the relationship between a German TV journalist, Jürgen Hinzpeter, and the cabdriver who drove him from Seoul to the locked-down city of Gwangju, at the time a hotbed of pro-democracy student rebellion and violent repression. While the real-life name of the cabby and his ultimate fate are unclear (his name may have been Kim Sa-bok), the film calls him Kim Man-seob and gives him a poignant back story and destiny.Kim (Song Kang-ho) is a garrulous if gruff widowed father to an 11-year-old girl, impatient with traffic jams resulting from protests in Seoul. If it weren’t for the back rent he owes, he wouldn’t need to take Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann) to the besieged Gwangju. But when he does, they witness a huge street demonstration that is met with tear gas and military brutality. The soft-spoken Hinzpeter is determined to smuggle footage of the dictatorship’s abuses to a German news organization, while the heretofore neutral Kim comes to realize the urgency of Hinzpeter’s mission.The film climaxes with a breathless escape from Gwangju, as Kim and Hinzpeter elude government vehicles with the aid of other cabdrivers. But most impressive is Mr. Song, who persuasively conveys a working stiff’s political awakening."

It’s Cairo.”Had a similar line not been made famous in another noir, that one might serve as an apt ending for “The Nile Hilton Incident,” a film that owes debts to “Chinatown,” “The Long Goodbye” and other crime mysteries that are marinated in cynicism.Noredin (Fares Fares), a police detective, trolls the city, demanding payoffs from whoever is unlucky enough to cross his path. To call him corrupt is not to say that the rest of the force is clean. Everyone here is on the take, all the time, from cops to clerks to politicians.Noredin gets the case of a murdered woman, a crime that higher-ups are eager to label a suicide. But Salwa (Mari Malek), a hotel maid, saw something, and Noredin develops a shred of conscience that leads him to investigate. Perhaps he’s spurred by his father, who looks upon him and his ill-gotten gains with disappointment and says, “You can’t buy dignity, son.”Anger seethes throughout the story, set days before the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Tarik Saleh, the writer and director, constantly eyeballs the crowded city, its chaotic masses and its crumbling buildings. Cigarettes are smoked by the carton, exhaust chokes the air and everything is falling apart. It’s horribly fascinating to watch.The trouble with the movie — and it’s significant — is that Mr. Saleh is so keen to survey Egypt’s dysfunction that his pacing wanes. It’s possible to admire each scene and still see this film, in its entirety, as in need of some serious sharpening.Mr. Fares, playing against his sidekick role in the superb “Department Q” films, is captivating as he takes the lead. He goes down those mean streets as a man must go, but here he’s got an added worry — those streets are set to explode."

But despite its setting in Hiroshima and the nearby port city, Kure, the new anime film “In This Corner of the World” is as soft as its brown-and-green palette, as romantic as its perpetually blushing protagonist, Suzu, a young wife coming of age during World War II. As war rages, Suzu’s endurance becomes the personification of hope for postwar Japan.In his adaptation of Fumiyo Kouno’s 2007 manga, the director, Sunao Katabuchi, has recreated the Japanese home front with historical accuracy, and “In This Corner of the World” thrives when it lingers on incidental observations of life in wartime. Suzu transforms a kimono into a jumpsuit; she makes the most of her family’s meager rations. “Moonlight Serenade” plays on the radio at the military hospital where Suzu visits her father-in-law, and her niece Harumi asks, “Is this the enemy’s music?”Compared with the fine detail of her home, though, Suzu is drawn with broad strokes. She has the artistic eye to see bombs burst like flashes of colored paint, and the emotional depth to recognize death as a crude scrawl of white pencil on black, yet Suzu asks fewer questions of war than she does a marriage proposal. Bombs drop and cities fall, but Suzu never wonders why Kure needs its navy, or why she should support the war effort. As our window into a world lost to violence, Suzu gives us the chance to see rabbits in rivers, though her rosy view obscures history’s shadows with a preponderance of golden light."

Here the filmmakers take a chance and turn a strange-seeming premise into a fast-moving tale.The bulk of the story is set in Ireland in 1209, where a group of monks safeguards a holy relic. A visitor, Geraldus (Stanley Weber), arrives with papal orders to bring this MacGuffin to Rome. Four of the monks and a secretive mute (Jon Bernthal, sullen and entrancing) are assigned to shepherd Geraldus and the relic across the country.This Ireland isn’t the land of Guinness, and green is in short supply; most scenes here are steeped in shades of gray, matching the film’s forbidding mood. Enemies soon arrive to steal the relic, and the chases begin.The youngest monk, Diarmuid (Tom Holland, in a robe instead of the tights he wears as the new Spider-Man), is reliably good-hearted, the better to contrast with Raymond (Richard Armitage), one of the brutal bad guys. John Lynch, Ruaidhri Conroy and Hugh O’Conor, all convincing, play the other three monks.Brendan Muldowney, the director, and Jamie Hannigan, the screenwriter, keep something happening in each scene; the pace is swift, except for shots of misty hills and shadowy forests that are lingered over as the ominous score moans. The main battle is an exercise in Grand Guignol, with swords, arrows and axes impaling faces and severing limbs.Amid that gore (including a harsh stoning — not that there’s any other kind — and an exciting yet vicious conclusion), “Pilgrimage” raises a question or two about unexamined beliefs and religious zeal. Those questions, as well as all that blood, won’t appeal to everyone. But those who can stomach them will receive some dark rewards."

The main object of that ambivalence is Rex Walls, a big-talking, big-dreaming ne’er-do-well played with the usual guile and gusto by Woody Harrelson.Rex would qualify as a helicopter parent if that phrase referred to someone who encouraged his kid to pilot a chopper without proper training or safety equipment. If he and his wife, Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), don’t go quite that far, it may only be for lack of available aircraft. Their four children are, to use another slightly anachronistic idiom in reference to a story set mostly in the ’60s and ’70s, decidedly free range. At a swimming pool, Rex throws Jeannette, his second-oldest daughter, into deep water to teach her to swim. That’s hardly the craziest thing he does, but it’s a convenient metaphor for his approach to parenting.Jeannette, played in middle childhood by a wonderfully shrewd and watchful young actress named Ella Anderson, will grow up to be played by Brie Larson and to grapple with adulthood in late-’80s New York, where she writes a gossip column. Eventually, she’ll also write a best-selling memoir of her hectic childhood, which has now been adapted into this uneven, conscientious film, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and written by Mr. Cretton and Andrew Lanham.Lacking the book’s episodic sprawl and psychological nuance, their movie clings to its essential tension. Jeannette, her father’s favorite — his nickname for her is Mountain Goat — admires her parents’ free-spirited individualism even as she suffers amid the chaos of their chosen way of life. Money is always short, and the family often picks up and moves, one step ahead of bill collectors or law enforcement. Rose Mary paints landscapes, still lifes and portraits, while Rex, bouncing from job to job, conjures fantastical, almost-practical projects, like the solar-powered mansion that gives the movie its title.The clan’s nomadic period, which takes up roughly the first half of Ms. Walls’s memoir, is truncated on screen, and the audience never gets a full dose of the paternal wanderlust that provides Jeannette’s childhood with its thrills and terrors. We spend more time in Welch, W.Va., Rex’s Appalachian hometown, to which he had vowed never to return. Once there, in the shadow of his sinister mother, Erma (Robin Bartlett), Rex starts drinking more and dreaming less. As his charm dissolves, he devolves from a mischievous daredevil into a ranting, tyrannical drunk.Meanwhile, in the film’s back-and-forth time scheme, adult Jeannette tries to find a place for her past (and her parents, who are now squatting on Manhattan’s pre-gentrified Lower East Side) in her polished, professional existence. What this mostly means is trying to reconcile her attachment to Rex with her engagement to David, a sacrificial yuppie played by Max Greenfield. He’s not a bad guy, he just cares about money, material possessions and what other people think. All of that makes him, somewhat too obviously, Rex’s opposite.While Jeannette’s attempt to deal with the men in her life provides “The Glass Castle” with a bit of drama (and some comic scenes as well), it’s frustrating to see the resourceful Ms. Larson pinioned between two showy male performers. Jeannette, the central voice and consciousness in the book, is an oddly blurred character on screen. And the film itself loses focus as it drifts toward the conventions of the coming-of-age story and the family-dysfunction melodrama.Conformity wins out in the end. Not that Rex — or the indefatigable Mr. Harrelson — is ever really tamed. But Mr. Lanham and Mr. Cretton, who proved himself a sensitive, risk-taking filmmaker with “Short Term 12” (also starring Ms. Larson), couldn’t find a way to contain both the father’s anarchy and the daughter’s skeptical affection for him. The movie bogs down in dialogue-heavy obvious scenes, some of which refer to events in the book that didn’t make it onto the screen. It’s both too tidy and too messy, and at the same time neither quite wild nor quite sensible enough."

The scenery is so gray that fabrics, embers and dyes are just about all that pops against the background. The ideological charge leveled for decades at this strain of filmmaking is that such eye-catching tableaus romanticize poverty, but prettified squalor has become sadly familiar in global documentary filmmaking. In “Machines,” even at barely more than an hour, the style leads to diminishing returns.“Machines” is at its strongest when interviewing the workers, who aren’t named and who, the film not so subtly implies, have become cogs in the machinery themselves. One man says he has taken loans to travel for work and rides a standing-room-only train on his 1,000-mile journey to the factory. In his view, this situation would only be exploitation if he were forced to work there. Another worker asks, “Why would I get angry if I am being paid for the work I do?” The shifts pay next to nothing and last 12 hours.The imperious bosses openly disdain their employees. One dismisses his workers as careless with money and, in many cases, uninterested in their families (although we’ve already heard otherwise).The film — Mr. Jain’s first feature — seems to argue that the workers, facing few or no other options, have succumbed to a form of Stockholm syndrome, and points to unionization as a potential corrective. “If the workers unite, they can get the bosses to yield,” one worker says. “But the laborers are not united.”If they are parts in a machine, maybe they can form a whole. And even then, success is not guaranteed."

The married Boris and Marie are breaking up but for economic reasons are still sharing the same living space (to which the entire movie is confined; good thing there’s an outdoor patio). They have lovely twin daughters in front of whom they mostly argue — vehemently and with little regard for how these displays will affect the girls. Money is an issue; Marie comes from affluence, while Boris, a contractor who refers to himself as an architect, rarely has any. He incessantly confronts Marie over the labor he’s put into their apartment.Marie, a narrowly conceived character nevertheless played well by Bérénice Bejo, is uptight and withholding; Boris, by turns warmly bearish and broadly truculent as played by Cédric Kahn, is controlling and manipulative, not to mention aggressively self-pitying. When he responds sympathetically to Marie’s vulnerability, it’s hard to tell if he is being sincere in his affection, or just exploiting a weakness. (Marthe Keller makes a welcome contribution as Marie’s mother, whose voice-of-experience advice to her daughter falls on willfully deaf ears.)Not unlike an expensively tattooed panhandler, the couple elicit only a skeptical kind of sympathy. The American filmmaker John Cassavetes was able to make this kind of hate-love-hate scenario compulsively watchable (in movies like “A Woman Under the Influence”), partly because he made his characters operatically brash, their actions relentlessly emotionally combustible. “After Love,” written by Mazarine Pingeot, Fanny Burdino and Mr. Lafosse, and originally titled the less evocative but frankly more apt “L’économie du couple,” is too polite by half ever to generate any such sparks."

The juxtaposition of the imagery and the poetics make for a peculiar opening. Eventually it all makes tragic sense.Here, Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. He seems on intimate terms with the residents there; his ex-wife, with whom he has a young son and had a daughter, is a Native American with family on the reservation. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds a corpse frozen in the mountain snow. The dead young woman, who suffered a head injury and was also raped, was the best friend of Cory’s daughter, who died three years earlier under similar circumstances.Homicide on an Indian reservation, as it happens, is a federal crime. The F.B.I. — which, going by the attitude of the reservation’s quiet police chief, is consistently less helpful than it should be — dispatches Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), a seemingly very green agent, to head the investigation. She shows up wearing an F.B.I. windbreaker, and Cory calmly informs her that she’ll be dead within five minutes if she goes up the mountain dressed like that.“See what they send us,” one resident says mournfully, shaking his head. In a different movie, the introduction of Jane and Cory would be a meet-cute. But Mr. Sheridan, who also avoided injecting a romantic theme into his script for “Sicario,” in which Emily Blunt played an F.B.I. operative, has different, more serious reasons for making this character a woman. Jane acts partly as an audience surrogate, a well-intentioned outsider whose empathy and sincere desire to act on behalf of the female murder victim only gets her so far.The case lights up a cold fury in Cory. He reassures the victim’s father, “I’m a hunter.” He demonstrates to Jane that in this terrain, it’s the landscape that will yield the most important answers, not the frequently recalcitrant Indians whom Jane wants to interview. He’s right, of course, and his wisdom is borne out in some gut-wrenching ways.VideoElizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner spoke about their new film ""Wind River"" and answered online questions.Published OnAug. 3, 2017CreditCreditFred Hayes/The Weinstein CompanyUnder David Mackenzie’s direction, “Hell or High Water” tended to overstate its hard-times-in-the-United-States theme; it seemed that every fifth shot or so showed a house foreclosure sale sign or a bankruptcy lawyer’s billboard. As a director, Mr. Sheridan is a little more subtle than Mr. Mackenzie. This is kind of surprising; frequently, writers turned directors really like to bring the hammer down on their subtexts. But Mr. Sheridan limits himself to one shot of an American flag being flown upside down. Other than that, he lets the terrible situation on the reservation speak for itself. An actor before he was a screenwriter, Mr. Sheridan clearly spent a lot of his time learning about filmmaking on movie sets; his direction is assured throughout. A standoff scene near the movie’s finale would not be shamed if put next to one of Michael Mann’s better set pieces.The performances Mr. Sheridan draws from his cast are all excellent. Mr. Renner, who’s been spending too much of his career imparting convincing humanity to a second-tier Marvel superhero, is in excellent form as Cory. Ms. Olsen, who has been co-starring in those Marvel films with Mr. Renner, is sympathetic as Jane. Graham Greene brings his customary quiet power and dry wit to the role of the police chief.The movie builds to a shocking climax, even though the revelation of the bad guys makes immediate, sickening sense. The film’s ultimate statement sinks in later, with an expanded awareness that the justice done by the good guys in this film is not nearly sufficient with respect to the larger injustice done to Native Americans."

Columbus’s claim to fame — other than being Vice President Mike Pence’s hometown — is that it’s an unlikely haven for modernist architecture. Through a combination of patronage and civic courtship, this southern Indiana city became a home to structures by Eliel Saarinen, I. M. Pei, Robert A. M. Stern, Richard Meier and many others.Against this backdrop, Kogonada, a video essayist who has made artful film-analysis shorts for the Criterion Collection and Sight & Sound magazine, has shot a modest two-hander, using the architecture as a springboard for larger questions, much as his shorts are meta-riffs on the movies of Alfred Hitchcock and Richard Linklater. To his characters, a church and a bank by Eero Saarinen (Eliel Saarinen’s son) are everything and nothing.ImageRory Culkin and Haley Lu Richardson in “Columbus.”CreditElisha Christian/Superlative Films, Depth of FieldJin (John Cho), an English-to-Korean book translator in Seoul, travels to Columbus after his father, an architecture historian, collapses while in town for a talk. As Jin waits to find out whether his semi-estranged father will ever regain consciousness, he strikes up a friendship with Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), a tour guide and lifelong Columbus resident. A year out of high school, she is tempted to leave to study architecture, but she fears for the well-being of her unpredictable blue-collar mother (Michelle Forbes), for whom she cooks and essentially looks after.Over several days, as Casey and Jin wander the sites, they debate such heady ideas as the healing power of buildings, modernism’s relationship to religion, and why — or whether — architecture means something to them. (“You grow up around something and it feels like nothing,” Jin says.) Kogonada also introduces parallel not-quite love interests: for Casey, a librarian (Rory Culkin) whose disquisition on the relative interest of video games and books may be intended as advice on how to watch this film; for Jin, a colleague of his father’s (Parker Posey) on whom he had a crush as a teenager.The acknowledged influence of the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu looms over the proceedings. Kogonada draws not only on Ozu’s frequent theme of generational conflict but also on his shooting style. (Like Ozu, he often “crosses the line,” violating the conventions of how the camera is positioned relative to the characters in a scene.) The found backgrounds are as suggestive as the dialogue, with the director often observing his actors through doorways and mirrors.“Columbus” can be slyly mysterious from a structural standpoint, both with respect to the plot’s elisions and several cuts that demand that viewers fill in the blanks. The movie leaves quite a bit to the eye of the beholder, but it’s always worth looking at."

The Colombian-Canadian director Lina Rodriguez, who lives in Toronto, observes the daily lives of a family of three in Bogotá. But after a midfilm rupture, the movie reveals that the seemingly uneventful first section was more consequential than it appeared. As such, “This Time Tomorrow” poses a hazard for any spoiler-conscious reviewer. It’s also more admirable in theory than it is illuminating in practice.The key to the film may lie in its second shot, of a father, Francisco (Francisco Zaldua), and his teenage daughter, Adelaida (Laura Osma), watching television. Adelaida lazily calls to her mother, Lena (Maruia Shelton), who is out of frame in the next room. Lena is variously shown as Adelaida’s comforter, advice-giver on boyfriends and occasional object of pique.But after Lena’s birthday, the screen fades to black. When the movie returns, Ms. Rodriguez cuts among a succession of downcast faces. It’s probably not saying too much to reveal that “This Time Tomorrow” concerns the shock of an unexpected death, and how the sudden absence changes the lives of the family members who remain.Although Ms. Rodriguez includes a certain amount of foreshadowing, both in the title and in dialogue, few films are so rigorous in trying to evoke a structuring absence. But the withholding of details necessary to engineer the initial lull backfires in the second half, when the lack of specificity leaves the characters ill defined."

Have you heard? On big screens across the nation women are behaving badly, really badly. And now, bringing up the rear of this summer raunch parade led by “Snatched,” “Rough Night” and “Girls Trip,” comes the rather tame “Fun Mom Dinner.” These mothers just want a night off for boozy shenanigans and some smoking in the girls’ room, which, of course, leads to harmless karaoke antics, mild flirtations, an Instagram faux pas and pot-induced paranoia.These gals don’t start out as reunited pals, though — they only know one another through their children’s school. There’s bad blood between Kate (Toni Collette), who’s too cool for the dreaded Mom circle, and Melanie (Bridget Everett), a brash taskmaster with strong feelings about traffic safety. They stand down after a few puffs of a peace pipe in the form of a marijuana vaporizer pen and some encouragement from the recently divorced Jamie (Molly Shannon), a social media oversharer, and the new-to-the-school Emily (Katie Aselton), whose marriage is in a rut.The director Alethea Jones, working from Julie Rudd’s thin script, opens with a dutiful montage of the women’s morning routines. (Cue the requisite baby poop disaster and the Go-Go’s singing “Head Over Heels.”) The continuous intercutting, however — must we keep checking in with the dads and kids? — eventually grows tiresome and distracting.All four actresses have a natural chemistry and manage to give some inner dimensions to these otherwise archetypal characters. Though Ms. Aselton’s Emily is only marginally more realized than the others, it’s Ms. Everett who delivers the most memorable lines (“Oprah and Gayle, care to open up the friendship circle?”) — not at all surprising for those familiar with Ms. Everett’s, um, less-than-wholesome wine-soaked cabaret stage work."

This feature debut of the writer and director Jérôme Reybaud opens with a baby-faced 30-something, Pierre (Pascal Cervo), training a phone flashlight on his lover Paul (Arthur Igual). He then leaves Paul’s Paris apartment and drives an Alfa Romeo into rural France. The fantasy of walking out on your life and aimlessly wandering around can beguile even the most contentedly domesticated among us.Pierre is also looking to quench a thirst. He regularly checks his Grindr app, and at a roadside restroom, scans the stall graffiti and calls a number advertising sex services. He also picks up people along the roadside, not for cruising purposes, but to be of help. The first is a middle-age woman who is booked to sing at a senior home. The characters encountered are a bit more colorful than the ones you are likely to come across in real life, but not so much that they seem overtly allegorical. As Pierre roams, Paul embarks on a quest of his own, traveling to the center of the country to look for his lover via concentric Grindr circles.Some of this story is mildly whimsical, and there are ramps into some kind of magical realism (a blizzard at the French-Italian border is a little far-fetched). There are a lot of shots from behind a car windshield. These are more allied with Vincent Gallo’s “The Brown Bunny” than with Monte Hellman’s more lyrical “Two-Lane Blacktop.” While Mr. Reybaud has exemplary artistic confidence and an interesting vision, this is a movie that in many ways defines or justifies the “not for everybody” critical hedge."

You’ll know just how he feels. However inadvertently, those are the most relatable moments in this movie, and the closest its makers come to connecting with whoever’s still watching.Directed by Xavier Manrique from a script by Nicholas Schutt, the tale centers on Fenton (Shiloh Fernandez), a writer returning home to his parents (Mary-Louise Parker and Chris Noth) in Manhattan after a self-imposed exile on the West Coast. A fictional story he once wrote for The New Yorker, ostensibly about his girlfriend at the time, Jessie (Ashley Benson), and her family, wasn’t veiled enough, and they were greatly embarrassed.In the year or so since Fenton slunk away, Jessie met a new beau whom she is about to marry. By moping around her a few times and boozing a little, Fenton apparently seeks to win her back.It’s often an uphill battle for films about fiction writers — cerebral sorts who practice a static profession — and too frequently we see Fenton merely sitting and gazing at his open laptop, cursor blinking on a blank page. The premise here is already implausible: The days when a short piece of literary fiction could devastate a wide social circle are very likely gone. Worse yet, the stakes are always low for these high-income characters.Nobody seems to get genuinely sad or elated or — pick any emotion — in “Chronically Metropolitan,” making it tough for a viewer to do the same. One longs to praise Mr. Manrique for attempting a serious-minded story in this, his first feature. But there needs to be a real reason to embrace it, rather than what’s on this screen."

That rural town was light-years away from the Manhattan home of the CBS studio, where Orson Welles was retelling H. G. Wells’s novel “The War of the Worlds” in an infamous radio production on Oct. 30, 1938. Those unaware that the broadcast was a work of fiction fell for Wells’s story of an alien invasion. Fear that it was real quickly set off a panic.In Jody Lambert’s lighthearted comedy “Brave New Jersey” panic is positive, pushing people to say or do things they may have never done under ordinary circumstances. Out of the ensuing chaos, the town’s bashful mayor (Tony Hale, from “Veep”) is forced to assert himself, and a pastor’s faith is challenged, as is the relationship between a schoolteacher and her new fiancé.Through its many cheerful characters, “Brave New Jersey” emanates an upbeat attitude of a James Stewart kind. With its warm filters and costumes, the movie emulates a period film, but its sharp digital cinematography is at odds with its softer, vintage aesthetic.Mr. Lambert, who wrote the screenplay with Michael Dowling, aims for a modest, old-fashioned yarn about a time when people believed in the news media. Even when word gets out that the Martian invasion announcement was just part of a radio show, not everyone listens as intently as they did to the original radio program and gossip. The film’s narrative simplicity can be charming or frustrating, depending on your feelings about awkward dialogue and overreacting actors."

Though Mr. Ryoo’s taste for heightened theatricality threatens his story’s credibility at times, there is no denying his skill with a large-scale action set piece.ImageFrom left, So Ji-sub, Kim Su-an, Hwang Jung-min and Lee Jung-hyun in “The Battleship Island.”CreditCJ EntertainmentFive characters constitute the backbone of the story, which concerns an escape planned by Hashima’s captive laborers: a jazz musician (Hwang Jung-min) and his young daughter (Kim Su-an); a Seoul mobster (So Ji-sub) and one of the Korean “comfort women” forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese (Lee Jung-hyun); and a ruthlessly efficient operative (Song Joong-ki) sent by the Office of Strategic Services to rescue a high-ranking official. Their narratives entwine as the film advances to a bloody confrontation between the Japanese and the Koreans after an Allied bombing of the island.Subtlety is not Mr. Ryoo’s forte here: The Japanese are, to a man, caricatures of evil. The musician’s daughter is at one point tarted up in lipstick, makeup and silk, when she isn’t tearfully crying out for her father, while Mr. Song’s operative character is an indestructible force of moral rectitude. But Mr. Ryoo adroitly moves his camera through vast, crowded settings, and the climax sweeps you up in its ineluctable intensity. Its aftermath vividly conveys the pain of a national wartime trauma whose scars clearly have not healed."

Regrettably, his “Armed Response,” a low-budget, high-tech action film with supernatural overtones, is devoid of such a sense of play.A former penitentiary now used for interrogating terrorists and war criminals has been attacked by an unknown force, and all its support personnel wiped out. Now a Special Forces squad leader (a musclebound but curiously muted Wesley Snipes) reunites his old crew to enter the compound and crack the mystery. Among his team members are a hothead (the wrestling superstar Seth Rollins); a meek software expert (Morgan Roberts); another computer wizard, with a troubled past (Dave Annable); and a squandered Anne Heche.Off they wander through the complex, with flashlights in dark corridors, checking cells and sensory-deprivation tanks, finding corpses and discovering that this antiseptic labyrinth — called the Temple — is itself a sentient entity with murder on its mind. As they discover the fate of the Temple’s previous occupants, they in turn are, of course, picked off one by one. The squad’s history in Afghanistan, and complicity in abuses there, plays a part.The possibilities are intriguing, but the characters are underdrawn, and the pacing lags. (Endless time is spent looking at monitors.) There is a “final girl” of sorts — in horror movies, the perennial remaining woman confronting the antagonist — but we hardly know her. Most egregiously, “Armed Response,” whose producers include Mr. Snipes and Gene Simmons of Kiss, offers underwhelming gunplay and fisticuffs. And that prompts an indifferent response."

As this public charter school geared up to graduate its first class last year, the filmmakers of “Step” were there to observe three seniors, all members of its step dance team.Cori, the valedictorian, is hoping to receive a “full ride” to Johns Hopkins University. She’s the oldest of six children, and while her home life is anchored by a loving and supportive mother and stepfather, money is always tight. That’s also the case for Blessin, a hair and makeup maven — she seems to have a different hair style in every other shot. Blessin has trouble maintaining her grades, however, and in getting her mother, who suffers from depression, from partaking fully in weighing her post-high-school options. Tayla also has wobbly grades, and her mother, a police officer, sometimes embarrasses her because of her enthusiasm for the step team.This documentary has a classic twinned narrative: The girls must get into college (that’s the school’s main goal), and there’s a big step competition coming up. “Step” manages to tell both stories in under 90 minutes, with a city rived by the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody as its fraught backdrop. The film uses such crowd-pleasing devices as scoring a “Rocky”-training-style montage to Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It.” The action in this sequence is mostly Cori, Blessin and Tayla filling out application forms on computers, but one has to work with what one has.In trying to deliver messages of inspiration and empowerment, the director, Amanda Lipitz, deliberately swerves around the delivery of a comprehensive narrative. (In one section Blessin misses a day of school because of, according to a family discussion, conflict with some girls on the step team, but this issue is never otherwise addressed.)The film’s success is directly dependent on the personalities — and achievements — of the young women highlighted. Despite the narrative gaps, Ms. Lipitz excels at putting across those personalities. Blessin, Cori, and Tayla make you smile, make you worry and make you root for them.On the other hand, the polished optimistic tenor of the movie arguably makes their triumphs seem like a foregone conclusion. Beyond the quibbles I might have, though, this is a highly pertinent story told in an entertaining way."

Based — loosely seems altogether too generous a word — on the Stephen King series, the movie is an unappealing hash of moviemaking clichés that, after much scurrying and blathering, devolves into a generic shoot’em-up. About the only thing holding it together is Idris Elba, whose irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity anchors this mess but can’t redeem it.Mr. Elba plays the otherworldly Roland, whose name suggests the Arthurian legend with knights and so forth. Onscreen, though, Roland basically points, shoots and serves as an overqualified babysitter for Jake (Tom Taylor), a 14-year-old with psychic powers (he “shines” à la “The Shining”) who lives here and now on what Roland calls Keystone Earth. Roland, by contrast, lives in Mid-World, an incoherent realm of foggy woods, digital boogeymen, cinematic allusions, slavering nods to Mr. King’s voluminous oeuvre and some geological formations that may cause you to uselessly flash on images from John Ford westerns. (The movie was partly shot in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa.)For reasons that emerge in expository blurts, Jake and Roland travel between Mid-World and the considerably less interesting Keystone Earth. Also on the move is Walter, a.k.a. the man in black (Matthew McConaughey), an amusingly dissolute supervillain who, with weary hand waves and insinuating whispers, oozes about like a Vegas lounge lizard — with a hint of the Wicked Witch of the West snap – lording over heavily armed, face-changing, blood-lusting snarlers (Jackie Earle Haley, et. al). Mr. McConaughey, topped by an artfully arranged shock of black hair and flashing some tanned chest that makes you want to whip out the gold chains, has truly developed into a Zen master of sleaze.The title refers to a mysteriously woo-woo, sky-piercingly tall spire that somehow holds both the universe’s various worlds and its monstrous threats in check. Walter wants to destroy the dark tower; Roland intends to protect it. Jake, who tends to look as confused as the audience may feel, doesn’t yet have a mission, though giving this twerp a purpose — a kind of wee hero’s journey (“Surrender, Jake”!) — seems to be the endgame. It’s a default solution, and reads like a cop-out. After all, if Stephen King hands you a complex fiction that turns pulpy tropes into a dense mythology with its own language and heavyweight heroes like Roland, wouldn’t you run with at least some of it?The “Dark Tower” series can be traced to Mr. King’s love of, among other inspirations, J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” novels as well as Sergio Leone’s masterly 1966 film “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” which I suppose explains the duster Roland wears and an empty nod to spaghetti westerns. So, there’s that. Mostly, there are clotted action scenes, gun fetishism, bad writing and stop-and-go rhythms that suggest a longer version may once have existed. The director, Nikolaj Arcel, shares screenwriting credit and blame with Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner and Anders Thomas Jensen; whatever they thought they were doing here remains as mysterious as Walter’s hair product."

It’s a little amazing how a story so guilty of gross-out violence can retain a share of comic innocence.That innocence begins and ends with Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler), whose batty girlfriend, Liza (AnnaLynne McCord), plans to rob her sugar daddy (David Maldonado) of the cash in his safe. The bumbling Chip is reluctant to help, but Liza is persuasive — she punches hard — and before you can say “They shouldn’t be bringing weapons to this supposedly nonviolent robbery,” everything hits the fan.Some twists and double-crosses follow the theft, none of them too complex or entirely logical. But this movie is determined not to take itself seriously, and that makes it easy for you to do the same and cackle, even as the bloodshed turns ridiculously foul and cheesiness is played as a virtue.Mr. Gubler and Ms. McCord’s characters are matched to maximum effect — he’s nervous, she’s violent — and Trent Haaga, the writer and director, races through scenes as if there were no time to waste, adding to the energy. Though his script is only half as clever as it should be, that’s enough to give the movie a daffy charm. Alisha Boe and Sheila Vand, in supporting roles, are by turns sexy and strange.We’ll be “in and out like it’s nothing — nobody gets hurt,” Liza tells Chip as she plans the crime. It’s a ludicrous moment — there should be a neon sign above her head blinking, “Fat Chance.” In that scene and others, however, you find yourself laughing out loud, and minutes later, covering your eyes."

Karla panics during a call to her lawyer — her ex has a girlfriend and a business, and she’s only a waitress. But when Frankie is kidnapped while playing at a park, the meek Karla is unleashed as the vigilante Valkyrie of the Interstate highways, promising herself and Frankie’s backwoods abductors through car accidents and police interference: “As long as my son is in that car, I will not stop. Wherever you go, I will be right behind you.”It’s sometimes funny to watch Ms. Berry act out scenes of Karla’s frenzy — running at full speed with a limp, gingerly approaching a kidnapper’s lair with a gun she’s never used. But as a producer of the movie as well as its star, she approaches the task of playing this unhinged mother on the run with sincerity.The director, Luis Prieto, doesn’t waste time trying to build an arc to Karla’s desperation. Her adrenaline kicks in the moment she sees Frankie being shoved into the back seat of an unfamiliar Mustang, and it doesn’t dip until the credits roll. Cars crash, Karla rises. Guns fire, Karla slashes. The greatest strength of “Kidnap” is that it casts the maternal instinct as a primordial will to enact violence, to drag a man from a moving van, to beat a kidnapper with a shovel. We see Karla find her best weapons in blunt objects, and to its credit, “Kidnap” is a blunt movie."

This documentary takes us into the mind and body of a young Irish filmmaker, Simon Fitzmaurice, who wakes each morning closer to total paralysis.Speaking in the first person, the actor Colin Farrell narrates Mr. Fitzmaurice’s story as he struggles to pursue his career while losing his body to the neurodegenerative disease A.L.S., or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Frankie Fenton directed this film, which borrows from Mr. Fitzmaurice’s memoir of the same title and makes liberal use of boisterous and tender home videos of his family that also document the last time Mr. Fitzmaurice danced or walked.Perhaps the most striking aspect of the film is the shocking rapidity of his decline. Once his diagnosis becomes clear, when he is 34, doctors predict Mr. Fitzmaurice will live three to four years, but he soars past that (he is now 42) and remains amazingly productive, working painstakingly on his first feature film, “My Name Is Emily,” released this year.By the time shooting begins on that film, Mr. Fitzmaurice is using a ventilator to breathe. He directs the actors through his only means of communication: eye-gaze technology. His computer decodes his gaze and speaks for him in a robotic voice, which his wife charmingly refers to as “American.”He displays a powerful will to live, and he and his wife make the most of it so every day is memorable for the children, who number five by the film’s end. They steer the film, and their lives, from what might be unrelenting sadness toward inspiration."

The idea, a sort of “Super Size Me” with steroids instead of Big Macs, brought him into contact with Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who led Russia’s antidoping laboratory for Olympic athletes.Early scenes show Mr. Fogel injecting himself (needle-phobics, beware) with substances, then charting his performance as he meets with specialists and makes video calls with Dr. Rodchenkov.Months into the plan, Dr. Rodchenkov and Russia came under investigation for widespread doping at the Olympic Games. Mr. Fogel stops his own story and puts the focus entirely on Dr. Rodchenkov, who leaves Moscow for the United States. In interviews the doctor outlines Russia’s widespread steroid program and the clandestine steps taken to cover it up.Those revelations were first made public months before the 2016 Olympics, when Dr. Rodchenkov’s detailed confession about state-sponsored cheating at the 2014 Sochi Games appeared in The New York Times. In fleeing Moscow, Dr. Rodchenkov feared Russian reprisals, and the anxiety shown here is palpable; the doctor was eventually put into protective custody by the American government.Mr. Fogel could be considered either daring or foolhardy for his initial plan. But his work with Dr. Rodchenkov is levelheaded, and his documentary illuminating. There’s a lot not covered here — the ethical and moral questions of such drugs, their health effects and their use in professional sports are just a few. Those will have to wait for another film. This one found its timely topic, and smartly followed along."

Jessica, arguing with a guy she’s sort of been seeing, delivers a kiss-off: “I’m freakin’ dope.” That bold declaration not only represents a strong young woman but is also a gift for fans of the actress who plays her, Jessica Williams, the former “Daily Show” correspondent and current co-host of the “2 Dope Queens” podcast.And yet the struggle is real for her character. Jessica James is a Brooklyn playwright going through a “weird transitional phase,” not really coping well with a recent breakup (her ex-boyfriend keeps coming to an untimely end in her dreams) and trying to remain optimistic as rejection letters from theater companies pile up. Those notices share a wall in her Bushwick apartment with Playbill covers, posters for old school productions and inspirational quotes from Lillian Hellman.Her love of theater is deep, as witnessed in scenes with young students in a playwriting class she teaches. She bonds with one, Shandra (a delightful Taliyah Whitaker), who shows promise but is also processing the recent divorce of her parents. The snappy dialogue makes Jessica’s silly moments with the kids as well as heart-to-hearts with her friend Tasha (Noël Wells, just as charming as she was in “Master of None”) feel most lived-in and natural, even when she is asked to recommend a show for a friend of her mother’s back home in Ohio who’s “heard good things about ‘Jersey Boys.’” Jessica prefers “dialogue-driven dramas that explore the human condition.”The director Jim Strouse wrote this movie, which began streaming Friday on Netflix, for Ms. Williams after she appeared in his 2015 film, “People Places Things.” The camera lovingly follows her on her adventures in the city, and it’s easy to see why he was inspired to give her this breakout role.Her character’s forthrightness draws in friends and intrigues potential suitors, including the recently divorced Boone (played by a scruffy and slightly goofy Chris O’Dowd). They are complete opposites but find themselves in bed after an awkward first date. Their courtship involves an elaborate plan to break free of the obsessive cycle of stalking their exes on social media. The solution: Each will follow the other’s ex.But this is Ms. Williams’s movie, and she owns it. (Though, with its strong ensemble — Lakeith Stanfield plays her ex — I kept thinking it could make for a smart series.) She’s a radiant, tall glass of dopeness and isn’t afraid to tell you so. And in New York City, isn’t that how the strong survive?"

For sure, this funny and tender film prompts cheerful smiles, but sometimes they turn melancholy.Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the story finds the title character (played by Menashe Lustig) working in a small supermarket. He’s constantly berated by his boss and others, and their criticisms aren’t always without cause: Menashe is often late and prone to blunders, and is usually short of money.Outside of his job, he has a bigger worry: regaining custody of his son. Menashe is a widower, and his orthodox Jewish faith requires him to raise his child, Rieven (Ruben Niborski), in a home with a mother. A rabbi has decreed that until Menashe remarries, Rieven must live with an aunt and uncle. That same rabbi, however, has allowed father and son to spend a week together before Rieven returns to those relatives.Over the week, the two bond, argue and work, all of it shown with a naturalism that can be clumsy or graceful, but it always feels authentic. One mostly silent scene, showing them simply spending time with each other, is moving in its affection. Another scene, when Menashe is on a date arranged by a matchmaker, generates both winces and laughs.Joshua Z. Weinstein, the director, shot the film in Yiddish and often in secret in Hasidic neighborhoods. His images are unaffected and candid, with wordless close-ups that speak for themselves. Mr. Weinstein made documentaries before this, his first fiction feature, and it shows.The script, which he wrote with Alex Lipschultz and Musa Syeed, was inspired by Mr. Lustig’s experiences, and the actors are nonprofessionals whose performances ring true. Mr. Lustig is wonderfully empathetic, still more so when he’s paired with the splendid young Mr. Niborski.The film is worth praising for what it is and admiring for what it’s not — there’s no sappiness or false emotion, and none of the clichéd, quirky misfits who populate so many commercial comedies. (It’s a fine addition to several recent indie features, including “Man Push Cart” and “Stand Clear of the Closing Doors,” that examine pockets of overlooked city dwellers.) “Menashe” also gently raises a few questions about faith, change and conformity.Menashe himself is not always easy to like. He can be clever and friendly yet foolish and wrong: In other words, he’s awfully real. At times you’ll feel like shaking him in frustration for his actions. But minutes later, you’ll want to put an arm around this big man’s shoulder and, together with him, hope that things will be all right."

Gore) but still making the same arguments that have been hallmarks of his career.If there is a thesis in this new documentary, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (“Audrie & Daisy”), it’s that a rise in extreme weather is making the impact of climate change harder to deny. The movie touches on Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, and the Zika virus. Mr. Gore visits Greenland and the flooded streets of the Miami area. (He acknowledges a complicated relationship with Florida.)“The dots are seldom connected in the media,” he says at one point, but events like these are symptoms of global warming.As positive developments, he notes the 2015 launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite, and visits a small city in Texas whose Republican mayor has decided that renewable energy makes market sense.“An Inconvenient Sequel” delves deeper into the arcane details of compromise than its predecessor, with scenes of Mr. Gore working to find a middle ground between the needs of developed and developing nations. In a group meeting, Piyush Goyal, India’s power minister, pushes back against Mr. Gore’s desire to replicate in India the expanded use of solar energy in the United States. “I’ll do the same thing after 150 years,” Mr. Goyal replies.During the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Mr. Gore, who wasn’t an official negotiator, tries to persuade Lyndon Rive, then chief executive of the American company SolarCity, to grant India the rights to a patent on a type of solar technology. (The results aren’t clear from the film; India signed on to the Paris agreement without making a deal with SolarCity and still hasn’t made one.)Mr. Gore likens President Trump’s election to a quip often attributed to Mike Tyson: You always have a plan until you get punched in the face. The movie has been updated since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January to include Mr. Trump’s announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a decision that probably forecasts another sequel."

It’s the story of a young man who, after decades of being shut away from the world, splashes down in it like a space alien. There are reasons for his re-entry, though that’s getting ahead of the story, which uses a queasy crime as a jumping-off point to spin a largely sweet, often very funny fairy tale about the perils and the sustaining pleasures of obsessive fandom. Mostly, it is an account of one man’s great, mad love, one that’s mocked, tested and deemed near-pathological — a familiar plight for many superfans.The obsession in question is “Brigsby Bear,” an amusingly weird live-action children’s television show that James (Kyle Mooney) has been faithfully watching since childhood. Now somewhere in his 20s, James shows no sign of moving on. He doesn’t merely love the plucky, heroic bear — as well as Brigsby’s adorable helpers, the Smiles Sisters, and his villainous foe, the Sun Snatcher; James has absorbed the show, its stories and ethos into his being. His walls are lined with images from it; his shelves are crammed with recordings of each episode and related paraphernalia. He can mouth old dialogue verbatim. He even sleeps on “Brigsby” sheets, as if tucking into his own fanboy nest.If this sounds familiar, it’s no wonder. Who, after all, hasn’t taped a Marilyn Monroe poster on her college-dorm door or hung a really nice poster for the film “Anatomy of a Murder” on a wall? People have been surrounding themselves with objects of worship since time immemorial, even if today’s fetish is more likely to be a Chewbacca collectible than a terra-cotta object. Sure, in the age of global corporate media and cross-platform branding, fandom is a cradle-to-grave commodity lifestyle, from “Star Wars” onesies to superhero coffins. And, yes, this isn’t always cosplay; it’s a matter of life (and death).That’s partly what “Brigsby Bear” is about, though mostly it’s a sweet and sometimes delightful melancholic story of a lonely man saved by imagination and love. That sounds like a bushel of cornball and might have devolved into pure ick if the director, Dave McCary, didn’t lead from the heart and wasn’t adept at navigating seemingly clashing tones. He hooks you early with an uneasily ha-ha, strange opener in which James and two others — Jane Adams plays April while a warm, wonderful Mark Hamill plays Ted — engage in “Brigsby” banter. Soon, sirens are flashing and the movie darkens; a few beats later, it brightens, then swerves into silliness only to veer into seriousness.Much of what follows involves James’s confusing, awkward reintroduction into the world, or what some call adulthood. There’s the family he’s never met (Matt Walsh, Michaela Watkins, Ryan Simpkins); a friendly cop (Greg Kinnear); and a clueless therapist (Claire Danes). There are new buddies (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), who with smiles, mood enhancers and some unpersuasive narrative nudging help usher James into the here and now. Yet James, having been cut off from Brigsby World, can’t quit the bear, who’s seen every so often saving the day in some of the wittily conceptualized, visually degraded television clips sprinkled throughout the movie. And, really, why should James turn off the love?Mr. Mooney, currently cutting it up on “Saturday Night Live,” manages the twists and tonal fluctuations in “Brigsby Bear” beautifully. (He wrote the story and shares screenwriting credit with Kevin Costello.) It’s no surprise that he can sustain and complicate a deadpan. But what makes the character work is the unconditional emotional seriousness that shapes the performance, deepening each glance and gesture. Mr. McCary fills the movie with modest comic jolts, from James’s shock of hair to the near-Lynchian cardboard surrealism of the “Brigsby” show. The biggest jolt, though, is how each laugh brings forth more feeling in a movie that flirts with tragedy but opts for joy."

The new documentary “Water and Sugar: Carlo Di Palma, the Colours of Life” explores Di Palma’s long career, from that auspicious beginning to his work on “Red Desert,” “Radio Days” and some of the other best films of the 20th century.The director, Fariborz Kamkari, lingers on the golden touch that Di Palma, who died in 2004, brought to films with Michelangelo Antonioni, and he enlists collaborators like Woody Allen to explain Di Palma’s influence on their work. Though brief service is paid to this filmmaker’s personal life, viewers seeking a juicy backstage glimpse of his famous friends should look elsewhere. Under the careful eye of Mr. Kamkari and Di Palma’s widow, Adriana Chiesa, a producer on the movie, “Water and Sugar” presents an official history, focused more on work than pleasure or even personality.If the movie were reliant on only the rosy recollections of Di Palma’s professional connections, the man himself might slip out of view like the last light at dusk. Testimonials about his sensitivity pale in comparison with seeing scenes like Di Palma’s illuminated dance hall, empty but for one couple, who dance under the glow of a thousand lights in “Teresa the Thief.” As one memorable anecdote from the set of “Blow-Up” illustrates, he was a man to paint the grass if reality wasn’t green enough. In the end, “Water and Sugar” proves the best view of Di Palma is still the gaze from his own eyes."

The movie follows this winding time line until its focus shifts to a famous hub, the 924 Gilman Street music collective in Berkeley, Calif., that nurtured bands like Green Day (an executive producer of the movie), Rancid, Operation Ivy, the Offspring and even the filmmaker Miranda July.Mr. Redford, who wrote the movie with Anthony Marchitiello, shows enthusiasm for his subject but offers little context for newcomers to West Coast punk music. Interviewees remember names fondly but don’t illuminate why those people were crucial to the scene or what happened to them, leaving everyone behind but die-hard fans who are already in the know.Via voice-over narration, the punk elder statesman Iggy Pop presides over the nearly 160-minute parade of musician cameos and archival footage, but his scraggly-voiced guidance returns only intermittently to connect the dots between the years. While zine-style animated sequences and VHS taped interviews enliven the pace, the documentary is burdened by too much minutiae. Not every scar earned at a concert deserves to be immortalized in a documentary."

She makes a moving argument, introducing us to animals who start training as puppies and often end up tethered to a short chain — when they aren’t pulling tourists or racing. Sadder still are the cases of dogs who are killed when they are no longer useful, like the 100 animals shot by a recreational sledding company near Whistler, British Columbia.In Alaska, the 1,000-mile Iditarod, from Anchorage to Nome, is the pinnacle of the sport. According to lore, the inspiration for the race was an emergency run to deliver serum to Nome, which was on the brink of a diphtheria epidemic. But that was a relay, taking on fresh mushers and dogs periodically, whereas Iditarod racers use a single team.These dogs are portrayed as elite athletes, born to run, but the film points out that they are asked to, in effect, run a marathon day after day for the course of the Iditarod. There are disturbing scenes from the trail of dogs who cannot go farther and must be carried to the veterinarians at the next checkpoint.Ms. Levitt went on a sled ride once, and after a look behind the scenes, took a dog home with her.

But maybe that’s not entirely surprising for a movie loosely about authenticity and the little absurdities that abound in New York City.In expanding his 2014 short film, the writer and director Dustin Guy Defa re-enlisted his friend Bene Coopersmith, a Red Hook record shop owner with limited acting experience, for this low-budget indie feature unfolding over the course of a day and divided into several separate story lines. Mr. Coopersmith’s, though, is one of the more watchable and entertaining. He’s a real character. When he sets out to buy a rare Charlie Parker record, the camera, shooting in grainy 16 millimeter, follows him on a journey around Brooklyn, which includes a funny sequence involving a bike chase, and a recurring bit in which Mr. Coopersmith frets about his new shirt. (Is it too sharp?)Among the other ensemble members are Michael Cera, as a reporter desperate to connect, and Abbi Jacobson, as an awkward newbie reporter, afraid of failure; Tavi Gevinson, who plays an angsty teenager questioning her sexuality and other weighty issues; a spot-on Philip Baker Hall, as a withdrawn watchmaker who may hold the key to a mysterious death; and George Sample III, convincing as an anguished man facing the consequences of an act of vengeance.While Mr. Defa’s dialogue mostly flows naturally from Mr. Coopersmith, it can seem too self-aware and precious in the other characters’ mouths. And the soundtrack — an infectious blend of retro gospel, R&B and funk — often feels too breezy and soulful for this mundane affair, especially when it precedes scenes with pouty teenagers, even if they’re world-weary sorts."

He has shown commendable stalwartness in walking the walk, so to speak, not just starting a foundation to help victims of  Haiti’s 2010 earthquake but traveling there to help on the ground. We can read Mr. Penn’s latest directorial effort, “The Last Face,” as a kind of tribute to the aid workers he has met. As well meaning as this movie is, it is also a turgid, muddled one.“The Last Face” uses crises in the war-torn regions of Liberia and South Sudan to frame a knotty love story between Charlize Theron’s Wren, the daughter of a founder of an organization like Doctors Without Borders, and Javier Bardem’s Miguel, a dedicated surgeon. At one point Ms. Theron’s character asks, in voice-over, “In this place of so much war, had I found peace?” The script, by Erin Dignam, doesn’t get much deeper than that. The romantic chemistry between Ms. Theron and Mr. Bardem feels forced throughout, never more so than in a scene of mutual seduction in a cutesy context of brushing teeth. Mr. Penn is more than competent in recreating the noise, gore and panic of war zones, but far less so in simulating the atmosphere of alienated romance common in 1960s European art films.And then there’s the unusual text in the movie’s opening credits: “Vocal Artists: Eddie Vedder, Mary J. Blige, Suki Waterhouse.” It appears while a simple and haunting song of African provenance plays. More than two hours later, the end credits inform you that the song is “Makambo,” by the Ugandan musician Geoffrey Oryema. This seems an accurate indication of where the movie’s head is at."

A collection of moments rather than a linear story, this film is at its best when it’s suffused with the presence of the Dalai Lama, whether he is watching schoolchildren in Canada practice gratitude or meditating on separating his consciousness from his body in preparation for death.One fascinating segment introduces the Atlas of Emotions, commissioned by the Dalai Lama and developed by Paul and Eve Ekman, a father and daughter who used behavioral science to map human feelings and their consequences.Another shows Philip Glass at the organ at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York, playing music he composed for the Dalai Lama’s 1979 visit there and discussing how his own practice of Buddhism helped him as a composer.No film about this holy man would be complete without a recap of the escape from Tibet to Dharamsala, India, after the Chinese takeover of the country. The movie notes that the Chinese government has declared it will control the selection and development of the next Dalai Lama, an absurd idea to those who believe succession is a matter of reincarnation. The specter of two competing lamas, one controlled by the Chinese, also arises. In response, the ever-smiling Dalai Lama says he won’t reincarnate as a 15th Dalai Lama, but aides explain that statement doesn’t mean he won’t be reborn in exile, and the film is unlikely to settle the question definitively."

(As a former Chicagoan, I’ll confess to some affection for the location, around the corner from the city’s main screening room for movie critics.)There, Cassidy (Virginia Kull), an aspiring actress with no real prospects, takes a job as a courier for Barry (Ed Begley Jr.), a diamond importer who is seeing Cassidy’s mother (Marilu Henner). The job requires Cassidy to carry diamonds to nearby stores. The theory is that security firms get robbed; an ordinary woman on the street will not. And if she does get robbed, Alex (Ashton Holmes), Barry’s son, tells her, the business has insurance. Since they are both broke, the temptations are obvious.Mr. Singer, who wrote, directed and scored the film, mines a fair amount of comedy from Cassidy’s attempts to recruit an accomplice, Ray (Zach McGowan), her ex and a former drug dealer who, unfortunately for her and Alex, has embarked on a period of self-improvement.The characters’ musings about regrets — life is imperfect, you see — seem superfluous, the byproducts of an overwritten screenplay. Most of the movie’s pleasures come from Ms. Kull, a better actress than the one she plays, and the convolutions of the plot, which has a few good feints and dodges."

Darcy is at a crossroads: Applying for a belated bachelor’s degree, she may soon lose her job to budget cuts. Her son, Walker, committed suicide seven years earlier.Darcy soon learns that Mark (Shane Jacobsen), a friend of Walker’s, has grown wealthy after founding a chain of hot dog restaurants — Walker’s idea. Conspiring to confront Mark in New Orleans, she brings along her friend Byrd (Carrie Coon) and the gun Walker used to kill himself, probably more for symbolism than for proving Chekhov’s axiom.The journey is a pretext for healing, as Darcy visits an old friend (Glenne Headly, who died in June) and Walker’s father (Ted Ferguson), who abused her but is now ailing and mute. This gives Darcy a chance to unburden her thoughts to him while allowing Ms. Dieckmann, who wrote the screenplay, to avoid the complications of constructing a conversation.That’s the movie in a nutshell: A catharsis more meaningful for the character than for her audience."

Conventionally beautiful, that is. “I Dream in Another Language” features lush tropical landscapes and attractive, compelling people, always lit — not quite just so (the filmmakers clearly know better) — with exemplary attention to the most eye-catching detail. It’s delectably watchable.Directed by Ernesto Contreras from a script by his brother Carlos, the movie opens as a young linguist, Martín (Fernando Álvarez Rebeil), enters a remote Mexican hamlet to record the last speakers of a dying language. As it happens, they are two old men who have been enemies for 50 years.One, Isauro (José Manuel Poncelis), is a hermit who speaks only the dying language. The other, Evaristo (Eligio Meléndez), is a well-respected village elder who also speaks Spanish. Their falling-out decades before involved the woman Evaristo married. That woman is long dead, but Evaristo has an attractive granddaughter, Lluvia (Fátima Molina), of whom, he says to Martín, “You lay a hand on her, I’ll kill you.” In the next scene, Martín and Lluvia are shown together in bed.So “I Dream in Another Language” is that kind of movie, too. The story is not without interest, and it touches on a couple of worthwhile themes: cultural erasure and the way religious and provincial prejudices can suppress love. But its treatment of these subjects is perhaps undercut by its conventionality, which even extends to the movie’s left turn into a kind of magic realism late in the story."

Few viewers are likely to make it that far, so let’s start where many will stop: the English-language title, whose meaning is never clarified.Instead of a land of the moon, Nicole Garcia’s mostly turgid, occasionally risible period piece, largely set in the 1950s, initially takes us to Lyon, France. Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard) spots a familiar address on a building that prompts flashbacks to a lost love.In her youth, she chases after a teacher with an almost feral abandon, privately licking his copy of “Wuthering Heights.” It’s not clear whether she’s mad, as some think, or whether her longings result from a repressive upbringing. The movie barely seems to decide.Gabrielle’s mother (Brigitte Roüan) arranges for her to marry a Catalan laborer (Alex Brendemühl), who is bizarrely nonchalant about the deal. (At Gabrielle’s request, he agrees never to have sex with her.)But when Gabrielle receives a diagnosis of kidney stones — the subtitles translate the French term “mal de pierres” as “stones sickness” — she travels to the Alps. There, the film offers “A Cure for Wellness” unexpected competition for the most ludicrous 2017 release set in a Swiss spa.Ms. Cotillard can be magnetic even when playing an unplayable character, but when Gabrielle falls for a veteran (Louis Garrel, who has perfected the facial expression of someone looking for another conversation), the chasm between her abilities and her co-star’s is mountainous."

One item considered particularly risible in certain corners was a pitch to the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment from a sort of youth consultant, averring that “NBD,” shorthand for no big deal, was popular text speak among millennials and that it should be used as dialogue in a new “Spider-Man” movie.Sony’s latest release, “The Emoji Movie,” features among its heroes a female computer hacker who at one point shrugs off a crisis by saying “NBD.” I’m not sure if this is an indication of abject cluelessness, or if it represents what I believe some millennials call a self-own.This film is exactly what its posters would lead you to believe it is: an animated narrative film about emoji. It tells the story of Gene (voiced by T. J. Miller), who is a “meh” emoji but who is capable of making more expressions than the blasé one he has been assigned. His versatility is considered a malfunction, even, to some extent, by Gene himself. This leads the effusively smiling leader of the emoji to lobby for Gene’s deletion from the phone on which he lives.The rationalization this movie uses for the anthropomorphization of the emoji is weak, to put it mildly. But once that has been taken care of, Gene goes on his hero’s quest in search of the cloud, where he seeks to be reprogrammed so he can do the job he takes so much pride in. He of course has a bumbling sidekick (a high-five emoji) in tow. They enlist the help of the hacker Jailbreak and move through the corridors of their phone. Much labored app humor follows.For a long time, Hollywood has been propagating the idea that the panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so, by polishing it up with bright shiny gloss and enlisting engaging talented performers and writers. I can’t be entirely certain of this, but I would say “The Emoji Movie” takes this notion to the outer limits of credibility. The voice cast is full of name actors, some of whom have genuine appeal. One of the screenwriters is the very astute Mike White. This movie’s “believe in yourself” message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. To add to the pain and despair of the experience, “The Emoji Movie” is preceded by a short, “Puppy,” featuring the characters from the “Hotel Transylvania” animated movies. It is also idiotic."

It already is one, in a manner of speaking, given that its strengths are lavishly violent, inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron. The nonsense involves spies chasing secrets in Berlin just before the fall of the wall, which may suggest John le Carré but plays closer to a dumb and dumber take on Boris and Natasha. Mostly, the movie is an excuse to watch a beautiful, deviously clever female avatar as she is stripped naked, dolled up and repeatedly beaten down only to rise again.VideoThe director David Leitch narrates a sequence featuring Charlize Theron.Published OnJuly 25, 2017CreditCreditJonathan Prime/Focus FeaturesThis sort of spectacle — dress her up, dress her down, smack her around and wait for payback — isn’t new, even if moviemakers like to insist otherwise. What’s moderately different here is the sexed-up packaging of the violence in combination with Ms. Theron, who plays Lorraine Broughton, a spy in Her Majesty’s Secret Service with a blond bob and a fondness for lethal heels. Like James Bond, Lorraine shoots to kill while remaining fabulously dressed to kill. This means she gets slammed around a lot, and takes almost as much punishment as she metes out. She’s a punching bag, but she’s also a fantasist’s dream girl: the avenging goddess, destroyer of men.Lorraine gets plenty of opportunities to mix it up in Berlin, where the story soon turns into spy versus spy with washes of lurid color, topsy-turvy camerawork, loads of crashing cars and wall-to-wall pounding tunes. The airborne cars pirouette prettily, bashing and smashing with all the technological expertise production money can buy; the symphony of body blows, gun pops and crunching metal sounds fine and convincing. The tunes (“99 Luftballons”) basically just goose the violence and beg for laughs, having been chosen to elicit knowing smiles of recognition. At one point, James McAvoy sidles into the story looking all cool or something and wearing a smirk he needs to employ more cautiously.For her part, Ms. Theron looks hot and color coordinated, with black-and-white outfits that suit her character’s ambiguity. Lorraine smokes and drinks and likes cold baths, preferably filled with ice cubes that do wonders for bruises and nipples. When she isn’t moodily bathing or staring — into a mirror, the distance, what have you — she does a surprising amount of walking. She goes here, promenades there, strolling down halls and mean streets that the director David Leitch turns into fashion runways. She doesn’t slip into rooms, she cat-walks, making entrances as if looking for trouble or paparazzi; it’s no wonder someone says she isn’t well disguised. Ms. Theron really is ready to play Bond.ImageMs. Theron as Lorraine Broughton, who is dressed to kill.CreditJonathan Prime/Focus FeaturesWritten by Kurt Johnstad, “Atomic Blonde” is based on “The Coldest City,” a darkly shadowed, minimalist graphic novel written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sam Hart. As in the novel, the movie continually shifts between Berlin, where all the action happens, and an interrogation room in which Lorraine is being drilled by some intelligence types (John Goodman, Toby Jones). On the page, this bifurcation works, but on the screen it saps the story’s momentum, partly because there’s no violence in the room to distract from the genericism and puerility of the dialogue. At least in Berlin there are streets, beats and the sight of restlessly moving, twisting, slamming bodies.As she does, Ms. Theron locks down your attention immediately, holding you with her beauty and quiet vigilance. (She lets you see that she knows you’re watching her.) Plenty of pretty people slide right off the screen. Ms. Theron, by contrast, holds you partly because she doesn’t seem eager to let you in, keeping you curious as she keeps you at bay with reserve and sphinxlike smiles. This distance adds to her mystery and it also makes the eruptions of violence more electric. As “Mad Max: Fury Road” confirmed, she’s a natural warrior, but it’s interesting here that each exertion and exhalation, each meaty, pulpy thump, also seems to be battering the fortifications that she has built around her.Mr. Leitch was one of the directors on “John Wick,” a model of economic genre filmmaking, and he gives this movie’s action scenes the same pummeling, visceral quality. Lorraine punches and is punched, and her body is soon mapped by bruises and abrasions. It’s a lot of abuse for such puny returns, even if the fights are the best parts of “Atomic Blonde.” Mr. Leitch understands the expressivity of hand-to-hand fights and he frames them accordingly, pushing in when it counts and pulling back to show entire bodies in whirling motion. The closeness underscores the intimacy of battle while the distance underlines the performative aspect, allowing you to see both the choreography and the violent beauty moving forward and backward one bloody step at a time."

(Nearly every white character with a speaking role wears a uniform of some kind.) Occasionally things go in the other direction, with “they” referring to the white authorities, but the reversal doesn’t indicate any kind of symmetry.The movie, which paints a sometimes muddled picture of a chaotic and contested moment in history, is admirably clear in this regard. It understands and strives to dramatize racism not as a matter of bad personal attitudes or equal and opposite prejudices, but rather as a structuring fact of American life, an apparatus of power, exclusion and control wielded against “them.”Ms. Bigelow and Mark Boal, the screenwriter (who collaborated with her on “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty”), train their focus on two aspects of the Detroit story: the day-to-day texture of working-class black life and the operations of white supremacy in conditions of emergency. Balancing those concerns is no easy task, and the filmmakers don’t take an easy route through their material. “Detroit,” like its namesake city, is populous and contradictory, with dozens of significant characters competing for attention as richly detailed scenes swell in crescendos of desperate suspense and sickening brutality.VideoKathryn Bigelow narrates a sequence from her film.Published OnAug. 2, 2017CreditCreditFrancois Duhamel/Annapurna PicturesAt moments (the quietest as well as some of the most intense), you feel in tune with both the fine grain of experience and the larger sweep of history. The specific, close-up acts of cruelty you witness are comprehensible as manifestations of a systemic, continuing and frequently invisible pattern of injustice. The film’s struggle against simplification — against the sentimentality, wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America’s racial past — is palpable, almost heroic, even if it is not always successful.Early scenes — following a gorgeous animated prologue that uses Jacob Lawrence paintings to evoke the decades of job discrimination, residential segregation and heavy-handed law enforcement that preceded the 1967 riots in Detroit and other Northern cities — zero in on the rebellion’s immediate cause: a late-night police raid on an unlicensed saloon.The opening 20 minutes register Ms. Bigelow’s virtuosity as a choreographer of chaos. She illuminates volatile and unpredictable circumstances with amazing poise and precision, producing an intuitive understanding of events that quickly spiral beyond the control or comprehension of their participants. Her combination of efficiency and expressiveness is matched by the actors — a formidable, mostly youthful ensemble including John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith and Jason Mitchell — even though the script at times inhibits their range, locking them into simple stances of aggression and fear.Amid the fire and looting and the audio and video clips of the Michigan governor George W. Romney and President Lyndon B. Johnson, a narrower plot takes shape, a real-life horror movie folded into a baggier film that feels, by turns, like a combat picture, a cavalry western, a police procedural and a courtroom drama.The fates of a collection of black and white Detroiters (as well as two unlucky visitors from Ohio) converge at a motel on the west side of the city. Two friends, Fred (Jacob Latimore) and Larry (Mr. Smith), are looking for a little fun after a disappointing evening at the Fox Theater downtown. They flirt with Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) and Julie (Hannah Murray), two white women, and join a makeshift party in a room belonging to Carl Cooper (Mr. Mitchell).Down the hall is Greene (Anthony Mackie), a soldier just back from Vietnam. A few blocks away, Melvin Dismukes (Mr. Boyega), a black security guard protecting a grocery store, brings coffee to a group of National Guardsmen, a gesture of diplomacy as well as self-protection. “I don’t want those boys shooting at us,” he tells his co-worker. Meanwhile, three patrolmen cruise the city. One of them, Krauss (Mr. Poulter), is still on the job after fatally shooting an unarmed looting suspect in the back.The nightmare that brought them all together is remembered as the Algiers Motel incident. It’s a notably ugly chapter in the annals of late-60s urban violence, and one that has an especially grim resonance in our own time. Three black men were shot to death — nine other people were terrorized and beaten — after the police and guardsmen arrived at the motel, responding to reports of sniper fire.Real events depicted in movies can’t exactly be given away, and this episode, while not as notorious as some other race-related murders of its era, isn’t all that obscure. (It is the subject of a book by John Hersey, a writer for The New Yorker, published a year after the riots and reissued in 1997 with an informative introduction by the historian Thomas J. Sugrue.) The basic arc of the story — the killing of unarmed black men, the spasm of outrage, the impunity ultimately bestowed on the perpetrators — is always shocking and rarely surprising. I’m sorry if that’s a spoiler.ImageAnthony Mackie plays a soldier just back from Vietnam in “Detroit.”CreditFrancois Duhamel/Annapurna PicturesWhat matters more to Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Boal than plot twists or surprises — and to an audience torn between the urge to lean in and the desire to look away — is the minute-by-minute unspooling of accident, error and intentional evil that produced a tragic result. The important thing is not the literal accuracy of the overall account (though Mr. Boal, a former journalist, has been diligent in his research) but its plausibility. Is this what could have happened? Does it feel true?The answers, of course, can hardly be objective. The language of cinematic action — which Ms. Bigelow speaks as fluently and inventively as any living American director — is an idiom of feeling and visceral response. There are parts of “Detroit” that have a raw, unsettled authenticity, and others that sink in a welter of screaming and cursing.The Algiers becomes a trap, not only for the characters, who are stuck inside at the mercy of a maniac, but for the film itself, which loses its political and psychological coherence as the night drags on. Krauss, with his disconcertingly boyish looks and his sophomoric attempts to seem thoughtful, is a callow sociopath. His fellow officers Flynn (Ben O’Toole) and Demens (Jack Reynor) contribute sexual hysteria (when they see white women in the company of black men) and sheer idiocy. They are terrifying and contemptible — dismayingly believable figures from the prehistory of what is now called the alt-right.But as their villainy comes into relief, the humanity of their hostages begins to blur. In a horror movie, the monster is inevitably the center of interest, and once the first body in the motel falls, “Detroit” begins to trade its vivid sense of nuance — especially present in its delicate observation of Fred and Larry’s friendship — for bluntness and sensationalism. A complex, dreadful piece of history becomes an undialectical ordeal of viciousness and victimhood.The film opens with the assertion that in Detroit and elsewhere in the mid-1960s, “change had to come” and “the question was when and how.” But the promise implied in that “how” is one that “Detroit,” for all its impressive craft and unimpeachable intention, proves unable to fulfill. It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion — however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been — should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.The filmmakers seem aware of this problem. They try toward the end to give the movie back, in effect, to its African-American characters, to refuse to let racism have the final word and to free themselves of storytelling conventions that insist on comfort and consensus. It doesn’t quite work. American movies have a hard time with division and with real-world problems that have yet to be solved. American politics does, too. The great virtue of “Detroit” is that it recognizes this difficulty. The failure to overcome it is hardly the film’s alone."

Born in East Los Angeles in 1938 to a white American father and Mexican-American mother, he announced to them at 11 that he was leaving school — and did. He ran wild, studied ballet and, after seeing a biopic about the silent-screen legend Rudolph Valentino, renamed himself Mario Montejo. By 15, Mario was en route to Spain to study flamenco. On the ship home, Marlon Brando invited him to dinner. A bashful Mario declined.Mr. Fancher relates this anecdote about traveling in fast, starry company in “Escapes,” a thoroughly charming, thoroughly engaging portrait of this great adventurer written, directed and produced by Michael Almereyda. I’m not entirely sure that the Brando invitation is true, even if Mr. Almereyda offers photo evidence that appears to partly back up Mr. Fancher. Yet it scarcely matters. What’s important is the story and how Mr. Fancher turns every walk down memory lane into a leisurely, surprise-filled stroll through a labyrinth, taking us right and then left and then down apparent dead ends before guiding us home. Of course, how Mr. Almereyda tells these stories matters too.Mr. Fancher has recently bobbed up again in the entertainment news, a resurfacing largely traceable to the forthcoming release of “Blade Runner 2049,” a long-anticipated sequel that he helped write. The original “Blade Runner,” a cult film directed by Ridley Scott that became a cinematic landmark, long ago cemented Mr. Fancher’s place in movie history, especially for cinephiles. Yet you discover — story by story — there’s more to his biography than one glorious credit. At the same time, part of the pleasure of “Escapes” is how Mr. Almereyda, drawing deeply from the American pop archives (comics, old movies and television), connects the original “Blade Runner” to Mr. Fancher’s life with its movie love, romanticism, beautiful women and mad, circuitous rides.“Escapes” takes an aptly twisty approach to its subject. The title seems to refer to Mr. Fancher’s talent for leaving one world for another, getaways that Mr. Almereyda has gathered into discrete chapters. The first opens with an offscreen Mr. Fancher discussing the Spanish word “duende” over battered black-and-white images of a man being shot out of a saddle in a western. “Anything that has death in it,” Mr. Fancher says, “and wants to live beyond its limits — that is expressive and crazy — that has duende.” Elsewhere, the poet Federico García Lorca wrote that duende is “not a question of skill, but of a style that’s truly alive: meaning, it’s in the veins: meaning, it’s of the most ancient culture of immediate creation.”ImageHampton Fancher in his flamenco phase. By the age of 15, he was en route to Spain to study dance.CreditGrasshopper FilmMr. Fancher’s life soon emerges as an argument for living beyond one’s limits and for style as something in the veins, as life. He didn’t just dress up in costumes — as amusing family photos illustrate — he seems to have willed himself over the rainbow again and again. “I lived in a fantasy world,” he says in onscreen text early in the documentary. “I was a spy. I was a hero. I was Humphrey Bogart.” It’s no wonder that Mr. Fancher became an actor and that years later, in transforming Philip K. Dick’s science-fiction novel “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” into “Blade Runner,” he helped create a futuristic world-weary shamus with sharp Bogart flavor.Mr. Fancher’s movie love and way of spinning a yarn to its near-breaking point — one detour opens onto another — dovetail nicely with the cinephilia and playfulness that characterize Mr. Almereyda’s movies (“Experimenter”). He folds plenty of tangy bits into “Escapes” — Mr. Fancher palled around with fame and was romantically involved with Sue Lyon and Barbara Hershey — but the movie is more essayistic gloss than definitive biography. It’s a liberating take. Because, as Mr. Almereyda marshals his material, which includes Mr. Fancher digressing at length as well as clips from his early TV and film work, “Escapes” dodges the dreary obligations of the standard documentary profile to become an exploration of life as (if we’re lucky) a long, endlessly inventive tale.This seems fitting for a man who helped create “Blade Runner,” a film that is, among other things, about the fragments we try to piece together to tell our stories. Early in “Escapes,” Mr. Almereyda inserts some text from an unnamed movie that reads, “Hollywood, the star-strewn land of ‘Make Believe,’ where enchanted people dreamed it would all come true.” Mr. Almereyda makes that quote part of Mr. Fancher’s story and it could easily be read as cynical. Except Mr. Fancher defies that reading. As it turns out, he really was one of those enchanted people who, despite being born in the shadow of the Hollywood sign, managed to push his way into an industry that he also transcended."

Near the end of one episode, the two women debate which murderer is the hottest. Soon they go to a prison to visit a convict (Annette O’Toole, a hoot), and along the way argue over their breakup.“You trick people with your boyishness,” Jean says.“I can’t help it I can lift semi-heavy things,” Morgan replies.Later, at a food co-op, Morgan meets Simone (Sheila Vand), a mysterious beauty. They begin a romance that borders on the strange, then grows downright eerie when Jean begins to suspect that Simone is a serial killer. Before some enticing evidence surfaces, Morgan is skeptical, and wonders if Jean may just be jealous.“I’d rather be with somebody that scares me to death than somebody that bores me to death,” Morgan says in a dig at her ex, who replies: “Go ahead, move in with her and get married and have a family that she can stab in the middle of the night.”Those lines and dozens of others are made sharper by the cast members, whose expressions are locked into permanent poker faces. Ms. Jungermann, who also wrote and directed this, her first feature, knows how to devise fast-moving and clever conversations. She’s even better at tacking a silence onto the end of a line, where it can prompt you to snort when you’re done laughing.As the movie enters its second half, however, some of that repetitive wryness can lead to slow sections as the is-she-or-isn’t-she-a-killer plot runs on, reaching for noir while relegating the wit to secondary status. Shannon Patricia O’Neill, as Alex, a foul-mouthed friend, and Grace Rex, as Kim, her fiancée, add energy, but a bit more physical comedy would be welcome.Still, working with what was surely a minuscule budget, Ms. Jungermann supplies an awful lot of humor — some of it light, the best of it dark — in “Women Who Kill.” Afterward, you may be compelled to go out for a drink, not just to discuss the story’s peculiar ending, but also because this film’s dryness leaves you feeling parched, in a very satisfying way."

What at first seems like a thin topic — quick, name two American Indian musicians — becomes a master class in the mixing of cultures.The survey starts with the guitarist Link Wray, who was Shawnee. Wray “made an indelible mark on the whole evolution of where rock ’n’ roll was going to go,” Robbie Robertson of the Band says. Wray’s 1958 single, “Rumble,” was banned from airplay in several cities amid worries that it would incite teenage gang violence (despite being a wordless, instrumental tune), and Wray’s guitar line seems to echo in every power chord you’ve heard.Charley Patton, who profoundly shaped the blues, is profiled in another section before the film moves to Mildred Bailey, Jesse Ed Davis, members of the band Redbone and others, all of whom had Indian heritage. We hear about childhoods spent listening and learning from grandparents who passed on traditions, and of discrimination encountered in the broader world. “Be proud you’re an Indian, but be careful who you tell,” Mr. Robertson, who is part Mohawk, says of a prevailing attitude when he was younger.Shorter sections explore American Indian rhythms and beats that seeped into popular music, and the deep connections the players forged with African-American performers. Newsreels and old black-and-white photos provide historical context, and interviews add plenty of energy. Martin Scorsese and Iggy Pop offer insights, while Steven Van Zandt’s enthusiasm is contagious. After hearing a story by Jackson Browne, you’ll listen to his “Doctor My Eyes” with different ears.Directed by Catherine Bainbridge, “Rumble” takes a few serious turns even as it remains lively throughout. If you couldn’t name two Native American musicians at the beginning of the documentary, you’ll remember at least a half-dozen after the end. And it’s a good bet you’ll be searching for their albums, too."

This is an unusual formula but not an entirely novel one. While other examples of this method, or some variant of it, have yielded films that come off as condescending or creepily exploitative, Ms. Covi and Mr. Frimmel’s “Mister Universo” is a disarming and humane picture, an unexpected delight.Tairo Caroli is a young man who’s an animal tamer at a down-at-the-heels circus touring the outskirts of Rome. One of his big cats, Rambo, has just died; a couple of the others are indisposed. He’s a bit of a knucklehead, picking little fights with colleagues, and one of these battles escalates. Tairo’s good luck charm, a piece of iron that the 1957 Mister Universe and circus strongman Arthur Robin bent for Tairo when he was a boy, gets lost or stolen in an ensuing scrape. Downhearted and scared, Tairo takes to the road in search of Mr. Robin while Wendy, the circus’s contortionist, seeks a variety of mild occult solutions to Tairo’s seeming streak of bad luck.On his trip, shot in a documentary style that manages to generate real suspense, he catches up with friends and family, mostly circus folk too. One of them is caring for an aging chimpanzee named Lola, a showbiz vet who has a central role in Dario Argento’s 1985 horror thriller “Phenomena.” Like Tairo, the animal represents a way of life that’s going out with the tide of the postmodern. The conclusion is worth not giving away, but it’s heartwarming without being cloying."

Although this film’s style is soft and colorful, it does not rub out the emotional sharpness of a story dealing with betrayal, suicide and death.An impoverished miller (voiced by Olivier Broche) unwittingly sells his daughter (Anaïs Demoustier) for a never-ending river of gold, unaware he’s dealing with the Devil (Philippe Laudenbach, the director’s father). Since the Devil cannot touch a girl so pure and clean, he persuades the father to chop off her hands, which had been washed by her tears. In turn, she leaves her father in disgust, making her way in the world until happening upon a prince (Jérémie Elkaïm), the sympathetic and caring figure her parent never was. Yet it’s hardly happily ever after for a young woman running from the Devil.Perhaps more striking than the adaptation of the harsh narrative is the movie’s animation style. Mr. Laudenbach’s drawing eschews clean ink lines for a minimalist and impressionist aesthetic. He allows the water color swatches that stand in for characters and landscapes to create a dreamlike world that appears poetically endless. When lines do appear, they are thick and textured, like those of a sumi-e painting from Asia.The result is a dazzlingly imaginative movie about survival. Left on her own, the woman in the story proves capable of taking care of herself, and later her child, once the constraints of comfort and gender roles are cast off."

The movie recounts an early, harrowing campaign in World War II that took place months after Germany invaded Poland and weeks after Hitler’s forces started rolling into the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. The plane, having glided to a stop, has been defiantly set ablaze by the pilot to avoid its being captured. It’s an image of unambiguous defeat but also an emblem of resistance and a portent of the ghastly conflagrations still to come.It’s a characteristically complex and condensed vision of war in a movie that is insistently humanizing despite its monumentality, a balance that is as much a political choice as an aesthetic one. And “Dunkirk” is big — in subject, reach, emotion and image. Mr. Nolan shot and mostly finished it on large-format film (unusual in our digital era), which allows details to emerge in great scale. Overhead shots of soldiers scattered across a beach convey an unnerving isolation — as if these were the last souls on earth, terminally alone, deserted. (Seen on a television, they would look like ants.) Film also enriches the texture of the image; it draws you to it, which is crucial given the minimalist dialogue.VideoChristopher Nolan narrates a sequence from his film, which was nominated for 3 Golden Globe awards.Published OnDec. 12, 2017CreditCreditWarner Bros. PicturesThe movie is based on a campaign that began in late May 1940 in the French port city of Dunkirk, where some 400,000 Allied soldiers — including more than 200,000 members of the British Expeditionary Force, the British army in Western Europe — were penned in by the Germans. The British, faced with the capture or possible annihilation of their troops, initiated a seemingly impossible rescue. Named Operation Dynamo, this mission has assumed near-mythic status in British history and been revisited in books and onscreen; it shows up in “Mrs. Miniver,” a 1942 Hollywood weepie about British pain and perseverance in the war meant to encourage American support for the Allies.War movies tend to play out along familiar lines, including lump-in-the throat home-front tales like “Mrs. Miniver.” “Dunkirk” takes place in battle, but it, too, is a story of suffering and survival. Mr. Nolan largely avoids the bigger historical picture (among other things, the reason these men are fighting is a given) as well as the strategizing on the front and in London, where the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, was facing the horrifying possibility of diminished military muscle. Churchill is heard from, in a fashion, but never seen. Mr. Nolan instead narrows in on a handful of men who are scrambling and white-knuckling their way into history on the sea, in the air and on the ground.ImageFionn Whitehead on the beach at Dunkirk.CreditMelinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. By turns intimate and sweeping, the film opens with six soldiers walking away from the camera down a spookily deserted street. Their bodies are shown in full, head to toe, and they are flanked by low buildings, the sort that now look so charming in touristic photographs. Slips of paper swirl around the men like autumn leaves. A few grab at the papers. One tries slurping water from a nearby garden hose; another pokes a hand through an open window, searching for a smoke. Still another reads one of the papers, which shows a map of the surrounding area encircled by arrows and ominous words of warning in English. He then crumples it, unbuckles his belt and begins to squat.It’s a somewhat perplexing, awkwardly funny moment — this is a manifestly serious situation, and you’re about to watch a man defecate. You don’t know whether to laugh, but before you decide, shots ring out and the soldiers start running, the camera quickly following. The haunted emptiness is suddenly filled with the sounds of frantic escape and whizzing bullets. And then the men begin falling, one, two, three, until just the unbuckling one remains, scrambling first over a gate and soon onto a beach where thousands of other soldiers are massed and waiting. He silently takes in the extraordinary scene and then hustles over to a dune to begin undoing his belt again.ImageTom Hardy in “Dunkirk.”CreditWarner Bros.Scarcely a word has been uttered up to this point, yet much has been expressed: isolation; danger; desperation; fear; relief; and sheer, extreme bodily need and effort. Throughout this de facto prologue, Mr. Nolan emphasizes the concrete details, making you acutely aware of the fine-grained textures — the sores and embedded dirt on a man’s hands — and every resonant sound: the dribbling of water, the fluttering of paper, and the sharp crack and mechanical buzzing of rifle fire that turns into muffled thuds when bullets enter bodies. By the time the surviving soldier reaches the beach, you are already closely acquainted with his heavy breathing, wild fumbling and clumsy, chaotic running.Soon, the scene switches to another port, where a British teenager, George (Barry Keoghan), is helping a father and son (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney) unload a small yacht that’s been requisitioned for the Dunkirk mission. The three men instead set sail on their own, joining a civilian fleet — a rousing, motley armada of tugs, steamers, ferries and so on — that’s racing across the Channel. A third, astounding narrative section soon opens in the air, where three British Spitfire planes are quickly engaged in battle against German planes headed for Dunkirk, racing through the vast canopy and bobbing under clouds as the sun flashes, temporarily blinding them.ImageFrom left, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard and Fionn Whitehead in “Dunkirk,” which focuses on the experiences of the soldiers.CreditWarner Bros.Mr. Nolan’s elastic approach to narrative works beautifully in “Dunkirk,” which oscillates among its three sections, each largely taking place in distinct locations in different time frames. The events on the beach — called the Mole for the breakwater that’s used as a dock — unfold during one week. The events on the sea occur in one day, while the air scenes transpire in an hour. The locations and the time periods are announced onscreen. At first the dividing lines aren’t always obvious as Mr. Nolan cuts from daytime scenes on the ground to those in the sea and in the air, a slight merging of space and especially of time that underlines the enormity of a fight seemingly without end.Once Mr. Nolan begins switching between day and night, the lines dividing the three narrative segments mostly sharpen. Even as each section — with its individual dramas and perils — comes closer into view, Mr. Nolan keeps them all in dynamic play with one another. Some of this he achieves with stark visual echoes, as when water rushing into a downed Spitfire engulfs the pilot and elsewhere a soldier nearly drowns. (Tom Hardy plays the most critically important pilot, while a sympathetic Jack Lowden takes on a critical support role.) At one point, Mr. Nolan pulls the three narrative strands tightly together, creating a tremendous, enveloping sense of bone-deep dread.“Dunkirk” is a World War II movie, one told through soldiers, their lived and near-death experiences and their bodies under siege. Names are generally irrelevant here; on the beach — and in the sea and air — what counts are rank, unit, skill and the operation, although more important is survival, making it through another attack and somehow avoiding exploding bombs. Mr. Nolan’s emphasis on the visceral reality of Dunkirk leaves much unsaid; even in some opening explanatory text, the enemy isn’t identified as Nazi Germany. The soldiers, of course, know exactly who they are fighting and perhaps even why, but in the field the enemy is finally the unnamed stranger trying to kill them.The soldier who scrambles over the gate and onto the beach is called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) in the credits, but I don’t remember hearing or reading his name. Mostly, I just thought of him as Our Boy, less because of his youth than because of the vulnerability communicated through Mr. Whitehead’s slight figure and tangible physical performance, his small and large gestures and moves: the darting, panicked eyes; the nervous, abrupt gestures; the hunched shoulders. In time, Tommy is joined by other soldiers waiting and running and ducking on the beach, the most important played by the equally fine Aneurin Barnard and the singer Harry Styles.Mr. Nolan’s unyielding emphasis on the soldiers — and on war as it is experienced rather than on how it is strategized — blurs history even as it brings the present and its wars startlingly into view. “Dunkirk” is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s. Mr. Nolan closes that distance cinematically with visual sweep and emotional intimacy, with images of warfare and huddled, frightened survivors that together with Hans Zimmer’s score reverberate through your body. By the time that plane is burning — and a young man is looking searchingly into the future — you are reminded that the fight against fascism continues."

Will’s solution is to take his citified family (Megan Leonard plays the mother) on a trip to the small town where he spent his own boyhood and teach Danny how to hunt.As they arrive, the police chief (Bruce Willis, understated here) advises them to stay alert because some bank robbers have recently struck and are still at large. On their first foray into the woods, Will and Danny encounter two of them. Eventually Danny ends up as a hostage to one, Levi (Gethin Anthony, in the film’s best performance), who teaches the boy more about self-confidence and dealing with adversity than Will ever did.But to learn inner strength Danny sure does have to witness a lot of carnage. In addition to jumping on the anti-bullying bandwagon that is so popular on television and in film at the moment, the movie tries for a second bit of topicality by including a subplot pegged to the high cost of health care. It’s an awkward attempt, and the movie, directed by Steven C. Miller, doesn’t hold a lot of surprises, but there is worse terror-in-the-woods fare out there — rather a lot of it, in fact."

As the film opens, he arrives in a small town, Haapsalu, where he is hired at a school and given the task of running a sports club for the students.Soon Marta (Liisa Koppel) stumbles on him as he practices fencing in the gymnasium, and she wants to learn the sport. When he starts a fencing group, the children quickly take to it, even as they’re stuck with foils made from reeds in a nearby marsh. But the principal (Hendrik Toompere) fears that fencing isn’t appropriately proletarian. (While the character may be a stooge, it might have been helpful to give him at least one scene of doing something other than thwarting or sneering at Endel.)The director, Klaus Haro, films the proceedings involvingly enough, particularly when it comes time for the inevitable tournament; his flowing camera moves might be correlatives to the careful balancing required by fencing. But the movie is almost relentlessly predictable and formulaic — a story of one man’s refusal to conform that dutifully hits all its marks."

But adding movies to the list might only raise questions. Who would judge? Should fiction and documentary receive separate awards?An excellent example of what not to award, however, comes from “The Pulitzer at 100,” an hour and a half of congratulatory platitudes timed to the prizes’ centennial. Although produced independently, this documentary, directed by Kirk Simon, plays as if the Pulitzers were presenting an award to themselves.Past winners, including Wynton Marsalis, Paula Vogel, Tracy K. Smith and Tony Kushner, share insights on their writing processes and how the recognition has affected their careers. Celebrities like Natalie Portman and Martin Scorsese read from winning works, with which they are sometimes oddly paired.The best anecdotes aren’t simple victory laps. Nicholas D. Kristof, a New York Times columnist, who received the award for his reporting on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement and his columns about the genocide in Darfur, notes “a certain irony in gaining from a surge in human misery.” Carol D. Leonnig of The Washington Post recounts her prizewinning coverage of Secret Service lapses. John Filo and Nick Ut explain how they photographed famous images of the Vietnam era. Reporters from The Times-Picayune recall Hurricane Katrina.Yet couching these achievements in a testament to Joseph Pulitzer’s enduring genius seems trivializing. The novelist Michael Cunningham admits that a different jury might not have awarded his book “The Hours” (“another reason the prize goes into the sock drawer,” he says). More charitably, Junot Díaz says he is surprised by how often the prizes get it right."
"9279","The Midwife","Not Rated",0,"GLENN KENNY","Review: ‘The Midwife’ Is Unflappable, Until the Past Blows In","Two great French actresses, Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot, share the screen in this film about forgiveness and redemption.","2017-07-20","2017-07-21","2017-11-02 04:18:28",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/the-midwife-review-catherine-deneuve.html,Read the New York Times Review of The Midwife,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/21/arts/21MIDWIFESUB/21MIDWIFESUB-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Catherine Deneuve has played a wide variety of roles over the course of a career now spanning seven decades. But despite her exemplary range, many American viewers maintain an image of her as an aloof, exquisite, possibly imperious, possibly enigmatic beauty. This is largely because she looks like, well, Catherine Deneuve. The woman can’t help it. Even when portraying the needy, nearly shambolic Béatrice in “The Midwife,” Ms. Deneuve is capable of vibrating with an elegance that implies both hauteur and froideur.Béatrice is not the title character of this film, written and directed by Martin Provost. That is Claire, played by Catherine Frot, a superb and prolific actress whose work in French cinema is not nearly as well known here as Ms. Deneuve’s is. Claire is fantastic at her job: calm, expert, compassionate. She cares deeply about her work, which, as the movie opens, takes place at a birthing clinic that will soon be closing. She cares so deeply, for instance, that she keeps trying to resuscitate a stillborn baby, long after everyone else has faced reality, in one of the movie’s many realistic medical scenes. (This one, in particular, was sufficiently convincing to arouse my terrified curiosity as to how it was achieved. The other childbirth scenes, and there are a fair number, also look authentic.)Claire’s job appears to be the main focus of a tidy, organized, somewhat lonely life. A single mother, she has a son with whom she shares a tight bond, but he’s approaching adulthood and getting ready to strike out on his own. On weekends, and after biking home from the clinic, she tends a garden in a shared plot of land. Her neighbor there, a friendly, salt-of-the-earth truck driver named Paul — played with simple amiability by Olivier Gourmet, the wonderful actor and good-luck charm for the Belgian filmmaker brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne — takes an immediate strong liking to Claire. But she’s not terribly interested in making any human connections beyond those she has with the mothers she helps, and the babies she delivers.But then a voice from the past sends a tremor into her placid life. That would be Ms. Deneuve’s Béatrice, a former mistress of Claire’s father (now dead), whose abandonment of both her lover and his daughter engendered heartbreak and worse 30 or so years earlier.Still trying to keep up appearances, despite being in a bad place, Béatrice reaches out to Claire for the standard-issue movie melodrama reason: She’s gravely ill (with a brain tumor) and is afraid of dying alone. Yet she won’t alter her behavior, which includes a lot of smoking and drinking, some hard-core gambling and extravagant dining. Claire gives Béatrice advice, refuses her proffered gifts and tries brushing her off, but of course she cannot. The tremor becomes something of a genuine seismic event for Claire.Because it is a French film, or rather the kind of French film that wants to serve its sentimentality with a dollop of prestige, “The Midwife” doesn’t offer an entirely shameless version of the “dying free spirit imbues uptight caretaker with a new lust for life” scenario. It doesn’t spoon-feed the viewer a lot of exposition, leaving parts of the back story a little enigmatic. It drops in peculiar little character touches, including one bizarre bit concerning the resemblance between Claire’s son, Simon, and his dear departed grandfather.But it ends up where all of these movies do: spiritually (if you can call it that). Here the corporeal manifestation of the spiritual conclusion is three characters of a certain age in the cab of a moving 18-wheeler, smiling and singing along to Serge Reggiani. If there’s an American remake of this, the singer will be Jim Croce."

In a different language, a different time period.”Mr. Clark is part of RAW Talent, a group of young people who write and perform poetry. The members decided to stage their own team-written script loosely adapted from “Romeo and Juliet,” and Jason Zeldes, the director of this documentary, “Romeo Is Bleeding,” followed along to learn about their lives and chart their progress (a plan similar to that of several films, including “Shakespeare High” and “The Hobart Shakespeareans”).Mr. Zeldes, who with Kevin Klauber also edited the documentary, uses fast cuts, varied camera angles and a patchwork of scenes to take in the varied perspectives of life in Richmond. The filmmakers walk with residents, ride with police officers and hear stories of young men who’ve been killed.This free-flowing style mimics the hip-hop and jazz-inflected rhythms of the student-poets. But it comes at a price; the portraits drawn of these young people frequently feel half-finished. As soon as a story or a profile turns compelling, the movie switches to another topic.For long stretches, “Romeo Is Bleeding” jettisons talk of Shakespeare altogether, though the real center of the film is, as it should be, the program members. They stay passionate despite discouraging circumstances. In Mr. Clark’s case, he had few options. When asked to join the group, he said, “It was either that or the streets, so I write poetry.”"

SCOTT","Review: In ‘Landline,’ the Family That Strays Together","Jenny Slate, John Turturro and Edie Falco star in Gillian Robespierre’s new comedy, set in 1995.","2017-07-20","2017-07-21","2017-11-02 04:18:28",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/movies/landline-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of Landline,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/21/arts/21LANDLINE/21LANDLINE-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Nostalgia is not what it used to be. “Landline,” a fairly genial, diffident comedy about diffident, fairly generic people, plants its flag in 1995 and surveys a landscape of indie rock, “Must See TV” and the high-waisted bluejeans that have recently started coming back into fashion. Hillary Clinton is on television, sporting a hairband and a pink suit.Mostly, though, as the movie’s title whimsically suggests, the mid-90s were an era of adorably quaint technology. Characters make calls from pay phones and listen to messages on answering machines. They take pictures with boxy little cameras, rent videocassettes of movies and make mix tapes on actual cassette tape. The members of an upper-middle-class New York household share a single desktop computer, with a dot-matrix printer and a slot for floppy disks.One of those antique data-storage devices provides the pretext for a bit of plot. Ali (Abby Quinn), the younger of the two Jacobs daughters, discovers a trove of erotic poetry her father has been writing to someone other than his wife. These proto-sexts are part of a small epidemic of infidelity among the Jacobses. Ali’s older sister, Dana (Jenny Slate), recently engaged to her live-in boyfriend, Ben (Jay Duplass), sparks up some action on the side with Nate (Finn Wittrock), a guy she knew in college. “We’re a family of cheaters,” Ali says in disgust.“Landline” was directed by Gillian Robespierre, who wrote it with Elisabeth Holm. They also collaborated on “Obvious Child,” which starred Ms. Slate, and which was notable for the mixture of sweetness and candor it brought to the subject of abortion. There was something bracing, as well as brave, about that film’s honesty. Oddly, the new one is much more cautious and decorous in its treatment of the emotional dynamics of a complicated family. For all the profanity and naughty behavior, it has the timid, ingratiating vibe of a television sitcom, sticking to safe and familiar emotional territory.Or, more to the point, it might remind oldish viewers of a certain kind of observant, clever but unambitious independent film that came to prominence in the era it depicts. The characters are not badly drawn, but they stay within the lines. Dana is the flakier sister, and also the more responsible one. Ali is quiet, guarded and critical. She is both more reckless and more grounded than her parents suspect.The parents, meanwhile, are near-caricatures of middle-aged compromise. Alan (John Turturro) clings to his literary ambitions and works at an advertising agency. His wife, Pat (Edie Falco), works in environmental policy but doesn’t talk much about it. They refer to a wilder life back in the ’70s, but, like much else in the movie, that feels more like a talking point than like an aspect of authentic experience.Mr. Turturro and Ms. Falco, with their lived-in faces and deeply seasoned acting technique, provide Alan and Pat with more individuality than the script does. The filmmakers seem hesitant to make any of their characters too interesting. Each one is an assemblage of surface quirks and emotional responses, neatly inserted into a series of dramatic and comic situations. Some of these pay off nicely, in particular when Ms. Slate and Ms. Quinn share the screen and capture the jumpy, push-and-pull rhythms of loving but not entirely compatible sisters.It’s strange to think that if Ali and Dana were real, they would now be in their early and later 40s. The fact that they seem so much like present-day young people is less an anachronism than an aspect of the film’s hopeful, soothing attitude. It’s a peace offering from Generation X to the millennials, a gesture of solidarity from one cohort of the metropolitan upper-middle class to another. We’re just like you, and we’ll all grow up eventually."

Yet in the end, the most regrettable decision may be that of audience members who fork over money to see the movie.Set in and around a national park in Australia, the story starts off with that charisma-free couple, Ian (Ian Meadows) and Samantha (Harriet Dyer), who plan to pitch their tent and spend time alone in the woods. She’s prone to dispensing exposition (“I’ve got no reception,” she says as she looks at her cellphone when they arrive), while he’s more than happy to ask a weird stranger for advice.Intercut with that story is the tale of a family who previously camped in the area. The two plots, featuring the same set of predators (Aaron Pedersen and Aaron Glenane), intertwine and, after a lengthy intro, move toward some revolting cruelness.In his director’s statement, Damien Power, who also wrote the script, cites ’70s “survival thrillers” as his inspiration, and like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” this movie has the hallmarks of torture porn: gratuitous slaughter, remorseless murderers and gruesome acts.Mr. Power says his aim was to explore violence, and he generates some suspense from crosscutting the stories. But these personality-free characters fade from your mind even as you’re watching the screen, making the brutality waged against them akin to animated mutilation of cartoon creatures. Certainly, the senselessness of bloodshed may be Mr. Power’s point. But with this setup, such a message is all but muted."

Its main characters, who live in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato, are young, gloomy, attractive men and women connected by friendship, family ties and sexual longing and divided by those same things. The movie, directed by Amat Escalante from a script he wrote with Gibrán Portela, might be a dour, observant study of modern relationships among the urban middle class were it not for the presence of a slimy, many-tentacled space creature living in a cabin in the countryside.The thing ostensibly arrived on an asteroid, but its more salient provenance is a pornographic tradition, notably but not exclusively Japanese, that occasionally slithers into the cinematic mainstream. The alien, whose gender is indeterminate, is awesome in bed, though not always gentle. While its partners, male and female, experience inexpressible and addictive bliss in its company, some of them also suffer grievous and even fatal injuries.The first one we meet is Verónica (Simone Bucio). While being treated for an alien-sex-related mishap she pretends is a dog bite, she befriends Fabián (Eden Villavicencio), a nurse. His sister, Alejandra (Ruth Ramos), is married to Ángel (Jesús Meza), a drunken macho sad sack who is having an affair with Fabián. Fabián, encouraged by Verónica, finds his way to the extraterrestrial love shack (which is tended by a sweet, hippie-ish older couple). But it’s Alejandra, neglected by Ángel and stressed out by their two young sons and Ángel’s domineering mother, who seems like the most likely victim. Or lover. Or whatever you call it.Mr. Escalante’s previous film, “Heli,” was about a factory worker caught up in Mexico’s drug violence. It contains several horrific — and now notorious — scenes of brutality, but what makes those moments especially unnerving is the low-key domestic naturalism in which they are embedded. Mr. Escalante is an exceptionally deft and subtle realist, and you sometimes feel, in “Heli” and even more so in “The Untamed” that he is drawn to extremity partly out of boredom with his own skill. And so he turns a downbeat melodrama of unhappy marriage, bohemian drift and sexual duplicity into something bizarre and horrific.There is another possibility, though, which is that “The Untamed” is not a slice-of-life tale pretending to be a monster movie, but rather a bone-dry comedy pretending to be both of those things. There is a fine line between horror and humor, and if you adjust your angle of vision accordingly, you can see the architecture of farce beneath the ornamentation of shock and suffering. The meticulous deadpan of the performances diverts attention from the absurdity of the circumstances. Fabián, Ángel and Alejandra are joined in a classic triangle, which Verónica and the alien throw into high relief even as they disrupt it.Also: Interplanetary, interspecies sex might function better as a sick joke than an earnest metaphor. That’s a matter of taste, I guess."

Even seasoned defenders of cryptic formalism may find it amorphous. The characters are never named, the camera work is static, and little that’s conceptually interesting materializes.The film consists of loosely connected scenes with a general focus on adolescent girls swimming, cooking, getting sun and contemplating the independence of adulthood. “Kekszakallu” eventually fixates on an almost-protagonist (Laila Maltz), who seems uninterested in work and unsure of what to study, and who somehow manages to have a car accident in a mostly empty lot.From the ostensible Bartok source — wonderfully filmed by Michael Powell in the 1960s — Mr. Solnicki takes his title (Hungarian for “Bluebeard”), snatches of music and perhaps the germ of a theme of women heading off into an unknown future.At festivals, “Kekszakallu” won praise from critics, especially those who regard the blurring of fiction and documentary (Mr. Solnicki’s background) as inherently chic. Two accomplished minimalists, Matthew Porterfield (the director and co-writer of the underseen “I Used to Be Darker”) and Martín Rejtman, are associate producers, and Mr. Porterfield is credited as a narrative contributor. But “Kekszakallu” lacks the ballast of memorable images or scenes."

Worse, Duleep (Satinder Sartaaj) remains a handsome cipher, brooding in the shadows of his own story until, upon occasion, someone thinks to ask, “What troubles you?”His troubles are many: He was forcibly taken from Punjab as a boy and has lived in exile in England, where he has become a Christian like his guardians. And though Queen Victoria (Amanda Root, wasted) has taken him under her wing, Duleep wants to see his mother again. And he wants to be a Sikh. And he wants to rule Punjab.A dramatic life does not necessarily a dramatic film make. Some of this story is told in quick flashbacks; but most of it unfolds in conversations in handsome period settings. Throughout, the characters’ interior lives are opaque. At one point Duleep, returning from a thwarted trip to India, stops in Cairo. Handing out diplomas at a girls’ school, he spies a beautiful young woman. Cut to: They have tea. Cut to: They’re married. Cut to: They have three children. Soon, more brooding. (“Sir, something sits heavy on your mind.”)The movie perks up briefly when the great Shabana Azmi appears, playing Duleep’s mother, a woman losing her sight and possibly her mind. Ms. Azmi seems to understand what the movie needs: a jolt of emotion and some life, regal or otherwise."

It takes a while for the true depth of all the complicated, confusing feelings to surface, partly because the movie’s most interesting character, the German-born Martha (Marthe Keller), has done a good job of barricading off part of her being. But don’t weep too hard for her: She’s built that wall in enviable splendor on the Spanish island of Ibiza, where she lives alone in a white house overlooking the blue, blue Mediterranean.It’s a lovely home in a heart-catching spot, and I could have watched Ms. Keller poke around it for hours. Alas, Mr. Schroeder, best known for “Reversal of Fortune,” has tethered both his actress and this natural glory to an awkward, unpersuasive story, largely set in the early 1990s, that coalesces around the lingering effects of World War II on the German soul. The war’s impact on Martha takes a while to emerge, ostensibly because she doesn’t like to talk about it or even to identify as German. She also doesn’t speak the language, even with her new neighbor, Jo (Max Riemelt), a young German D.J. camped out in a nearby house.Jo has come to Ibiza for work, but he’s soon scampering after Martha like a hungry puppy. She greets his attentions with a Mona Lisa smile; mostly she seems happy for the company. There’s an agreeable timelessness to their blessedly languorous moments, to their talks and walks amid the beauty of Ibiza. “Amnesia” is filled with conversations — often delivered in somewhat dissonant, sometimes halting English — peppered with bits of exposition and quotidian asides about, say, cooking with herbs (a little lemon verbena is perfect for fish). Later, when everything has come to a head, the ease of all this talk gives way to lurching rounds of confession and accusation that stop the movie dead.“Amnesia,” Mr. Schroeder has said, is a story partly based on his mother, who refused to speak German, so perhaps it’s no surprise that it’s strongest when it focuses on Martha, a character Ms. Keller inhabits gracefully. You believe Martha, who’s at home in the particular world that Mr. Schroeder has made for her. That’s the case even when you don’t wholly trust the words coming out of her mouth, especially when she’s indulging Jo. Mr. Riemelt has a few fine moments in the movie, but over all his smiles tend to be too wide and his body language too eager when Jo is around Martha, which makes the evolution of their relationship and finally the movie feel forced."

Already so far we have seen Mr. DeHaan, a 31-year-old actor endowed with poise, intelligence and superb eyebrows, in Gore Verbinski’s highly puzzling “A Cure for Wellness.” If you missed that one, it was more or less “The Magic Mountain” with incest and bloodsucking eels.“Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,” Mr. DeHaan’s latest eyebrow-raiser — speaking of which, it also stars Cara Delevingne, perhaps the supreme superciliary celebrity of our time — is a bit harder to describe. It was written and directed by Luc Besson (“The Fifth Element,” “Arthur and the Invisibles”) a fact that promises greater emphasis on visual panache than on feeling or coherence.That promise is faithfully kept, but there is so much more going on. To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea.VideoLuc Besson narrates a sequence from ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"" featuring Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne.Published OnJuly 20, 2017CreditCreditLou Faulon/STX EntertainmentMr. DeHaan plays Valerian and Ms. Delevingne plays Laureline, who are not his-and-hers dental hygiene products but rather soldiers in some kind of space army. They are also at least potentially a couple, a fact which authorizes a lot of dialogue that might technically be called “banter” but that seems to have lost its snap after passing through Google translate a few times too many. Anyway, Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders.Their mission — do I have to do this part? — involves justice for the planet Mül. Before it was destroyed, Mül was a beachy paradise, a perpetual Ibiza on the morning after the best rave ever, populated by hairless lizard supermodels. The key to their bliss is a pocket-size dinosaur that excretes pearls. Only one is left in the universe. Valerian and Laureline are its intrepid pet-sitters.What about the City of a Thousand Planets? It’s a multicultural celestial metropolis where our heroes do a bit of chasing and fighting, and its population includes some fine specimens of modern digital and prosthetic creature design as well as a few that are a bit, let’s say, problematic. The City might be an interesting place to spend some time if a busy and chaotic story didn’t keep getting in the way, and if we were allowed to hang out for a little while longer with Ethan Hawke and Rihanna.She’s in this movie! Believe the posters, even though she shows up late and leaves early. She’s called Bubble, she dances on a stripper pole and changes costumes in the blink of an eye until Mr. Besson’s script cruelly casts her aside. Why? So we can ponder the villainy of Clive Owen in uniform? So we can watch Mr. DeHaan and Ms. Delevingne doing their finger-puppet Rock Hudson/Doris Day act? So we can come up with names for Valerian and Laureline’s babies?I don’t know, and I suspect Mr. Besson doesn’t either. Though it is based on a popular graphic novel series by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières, “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” feels as if it were made up on the spot, by someone so delighted by the gaudy genre packaging at his disposal that he lost track of what was supposed to be inside."

In the 1930s, runaway brides ran amok with banter and high jinks; in the 1940s, femmes fatales did their men wrong with lipstick sneers and a bullet to the heart. The latest iteration of this type of movie often skews comic and generally involves a group of gal pals getting together for some “we time.” They find trouble and, here’s hoping, their bliss amid oceans of booze and maybe drugs, sometimes in the company of men, who are alternately helpful or hapless.The affably amusing, sometimes spittingly funny comedy “Girls Trip” recycles much of the same naughty women idea used and occasionally abused in movies like “Bad Moms” and “Sisters.” As in the recent “Rough Night,” the women in “Girls Trip” are old college friends who, after going down their respective paths, are reuniting for better and, at times, for worse. In “Rough Night,” the regulation naughtiness ends up with the women, who are mostly white, accidentally (uh-oh) killing a man. That isn’t on the menu for the black women in “Girls Trip,” who, despite being fictional also exist in our world and so presumably would have a much harder time giggling their way out of spilling blood.That makes “Girls Trip” seem tamer than a movie like “Rough Night.” But “Girls Trip” is also funnier; it’s also more appealing because it knows that there’s more at stake existentially for women, and especially for black women, than out-grossing men. The friends in “Girls Trip” have other issues to work on, all of which are grounded in ordinary life: how to live in the world with love and joy, how to nurture intimate relationships so they don’t slip away, how to balance professional and personal obligations without going nuts, how to perform fairly tricky sexual acts without embarrassing you or your partner right out of bed — you know, the usual.An invitation brings the friends and story in “Girls Trip” together. It’s sent by Ryan (Regina Hall), an entrepreneurial self-help guru who is rapidly heading toward Oprah-level celebrity. With a megawatt smile, an affirmation for every occasion and a beautiful husband by her side (a thankless role, capably handled by Mike Colter), Ryan seems to have it all. She’s turned her life into a brand by selling other women on the idea that they can have it all, too, but now she’s not so sure. After being tapped to speak at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, she invites three friends along for a weekend of sharing, caring and boozing, topped with guest turns from the likes of Common and Sean Combs.Enjoyment turns out to be contagious in “Girls Trip,” which consistently manages to rework and even reinvigorate some severely worn-out conceits, setups and character types, mostly by complicating gender roles with class issues. The struggler is Sasha (Queen Latifah), a former serious journalist turned flailing gossip blogger; the wallflower, Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), is a nurse and single mom; the cutup, Dina (Tiffany Haddish), well, it’s unclear what she does. She works, kind of, in an office or did — even her boss seems baffled about her status — but mostly Dina is the crazy snake in the can, the whoopee in the cushion and the movie’s biggest, rowdiest laugh generator.The director Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”) helps turn these types into characters efficiently and sympathetically — he knows how to light and frame a beautiful face — though every so often you sense he would like to cut loose visually. Mostly, he serves Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver’s script, which goes high, low and sincere as it mixes some slapstick in with the sober bits, giddily indulges its freewheeling silliness and drops heart-to-hearts ranging from a sharply comic lesson on white privilege to a hilarious riff on the joys of grapefruit sex. (Ms. Oliver and Mr. Barris, who created the sitcom “black-ish,” also wrote “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” which Mr. Lee directed.)Like most movies of this comic ilk, including the male-centric “Hangover” types, “Girls Trip” is effectively a narrative striptease. Characters — mostly ordinary, straight, middle-class types — take some of it off, the “it” being the cultural and social norms that define and often restrict them: the veneer of respectability, the accommodating smiles, the regulation control. At times this involves female characters testing, gingerly if fleetingly, the limits of that construct called femininity. “Girls Trip” adds complexity to the picture by bringing in class, even as it dispatches with whiteness, showing it the door so that these women can find themselves while rediscovering the power and pleasures of sisterhood."

In the late 1990s, a Dutch couple, Martin Verfondern and Margo Pool, post-hippie types looking to carve out a place for themselves far from the modern-day rat race — to get off the grid, as some say today — found an isolated village there whose name, Santa Eulalia, has over the years been compressed to Santoalla. At the opening of this documentary with the same name, directed by Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer, it’s plain that things did not work out as planned for the couple: Home-video footage shows Martin approaching a neighbor who calmly raises the handle of a farm tool and brings it down on the camera, causing the recording to go black.Ms. Pool narrates this chronicle, talking about how her husband disappeared in 2010, as Mr. Becker and Mr. Mehrer jump around in time. The couple are initially portrayed as sympathetic. Their only neighbors in Santoalla are the Rodriguez family, made up of the quiet patriarch, Manolo (he’s the camera smiter); the chatty, religious wife, Jovita; and their two sons, the voluble Carlos and Julio, who suffers from mental disorders.At first these families get along reasonably well. As the filmmakers introduce more archival footage, Mr. Verfondern comes across as less laid-back as he initially seemed. His plans for developing his land into some utopian retreat often run afoul of the Rodriguezes, and a dispute over shared forest areas leads to a courtroom battle. Soon the families aren’t even speaking to each other. Then Mr. Verfondern vanishes, seemingly without a trace. At this point the narrative deliberately goes slack as Ms. Pool weighs her options. “Santoalla” ends with the mystery solved. The threads that remain hanging imbue this peculiar story of paradise lost with a tragic resonance."

His 1975 “L’Important C’est d’Aimer” (whose English title for this restoration is “The Importance of Loving”), is no exception.Romy Schneider, as Nadine, an actress doing film work she finds disreputable, struggles on set to find the emotion in a lurid scene while Servais, a hunky, not-too-bright photographer played by Fabio Testi, tries to score tabloid dollars by shooting stills of her in the scene.He becomes obsessed with Nadine, and is soon intruding on her domestic life, which includes a gay, movie-mad husband (Jacques Dutronc, who in 1975 was better known as a pop star than an actor) and not much else. Servais borrows money from the mobster-pornographer he often works for to bankroll an eccentric theater production of “Richard III” that he wants Nadine to star in. The title role in the play belongs to one Karl-Heinz Zimmer, played by Klaus Kinski at full Kinski volume.Shot in the least picturesque parts of Paris and peopled with morbid eccentrics and grotesques, this picture, Zulawski’s third feature and his first made in France, is in certain respects among his most restrained. (It may be a good introduction to his work.) The searing, sometimes confounding film also ideally showcases the heartbreaking talents of Schneider, who deservedly won her first César award for her work here. The restoration, by Rialto for this United States release, is lovely; Ricardo Aronovich’s cinematography is largely a study of tragic faces, and when his light hits the whites of Schneider’s eyes a certain way, the effect is breathtaking."

As it succumbs to an invisible menace, this entity’s colors (brilliant shades of amber, magenta, chartreuse) turn fluorescent blue and purple and green before fading to bright white. As it decays, wisps of sludge drip from the skeletal remains.Apocalyptic sci-fi? This is real life, in the documentary “Chasing Coral.” And it’s an environmental tragedy of our own making, the film heartbreakingly argues, that has little hope of being reversed without immediate human intervention.The director Jeff Orlowski and Richard Vevers, the founder of the Ocean Agency and a driving force behind this film, teamed up to show the toll of climate change on coral reefs. Using his 2012 documentary, “Chasing Ice,” in which time-lapse technology showed the melting of glaciers, as his guide, Mr. Orlowski frames “Chasing Coral” with a similar structure. But setting up time-lapse camera rigs deep underwater off the coasts of Caribbean islands, Hawaii and Australia proved problematic. At one point, the assembled team of researchers has to document the deadly transformation of the Great Barrier Reef manually: diving with special cameras to meticulously record the day-to-day changes on the ocean floor. Once-thriving marine metropolises, teeming with sting rays, turtles, little yellow fish and big-eyed predators, gradually wither away into a wasteland of muck.The film gives a scientific breakdown of the biology of coral (these complex organisms play a vital role in the marine ecosystem) and the cause of the bleaching events leading to its demise: Trapped greenhouse gases have been warming oceans more rapidly since the 1980s, and a two-degree increase is fatal. But the film is particularly compelling when following Zack Rago, a self-proclaimed coral nerd whose love is palpable and infectious. The work takes a toll on his spirits, never more so than when after weeks of dives, he encounters what has essentially become a grave site, barely resembling what was once a fertile haven.Perhaps the most striking moment is when the divers must cross the deck of a party boat to gain access to a section of the Great Barrier Reef. The revelers hardly even notice the weary dive team, trying to spread the word of imminent doom."

Rather, this feather-light French confection, written and directed by Paul Calori and Kostia Testut, addresses its dignity-of-work thesis with sweetness and heart.The songs are unmemorable and the choreography less than twinkle-toed, but the lyrics are a delight.“Part-time jobs ain’t fine,” trills Julie (Pauline Étienne), the determined young striver at the movie’s squishy-soft center. “Filling in forms, standing in line.” Echoing the plight of millions of young Europeans, Julie longs for permanent work, so when she lands a probationary position in the stockroom of a luxury shoe factory, the eruption of a labor dispute threatens to undermine her plans.A cri de coeur against outsourcing and downsizing, “Footnotes” bossa novas its way through myriad themes without leaving a dent in any of them. Feminism (the shoe stitchers are all women), French craftsmanship and lack of respect for middle management are all lyricized, while empty design studios underscore the precariousness of couture itself. Love is dangled, in the smoky form of “I’m just a lonesome trucker” Samy (Olivier Chantreau), but Julie’s not having any of it. Not for the first 80 minutes, anyway.Softening the edges of working-class dreams, the cinematographer Julien Meurice washes scenes in pale pastels and hazy light. The result is no “Norma Rae,” but its view of labor as inherently ennobling never falters."

Not Clare (Joey King), though, the wistful teenager in “Wish Upon” who’s traumatized by what she believes was her mother’s suicide many years earlier. Embarrassed by her Dumpster-diving father (Ryan Phillippe) and hounded by the resident high school meanie, Clare wishes only to be rich, popular and adored by her hunky crush. Maybe this funny-looking music box covered in Chinese characters can help?As directed by John R. Leonetti, “Wish Upon” would rather make you jump than gag. The splatter is deployed cautiously and sometimes wittily, the story moving briskly from wishes granted to costs exacted with the help of familiar faces (including a warm Sherilyn Fenn as Clare’s surrogate mother) and a sympathetic lead. Pressing gently on the bruise of a broken home to explain Clare’s addiction to the evil receptacle (in a move that recalls “The Possession” a few years back), Barbara Marshall’s zippy script cuts corners without severing its bond to Clare’s emotions. Unlike Pandora, Ms. Marshall prefers to release a little bit of hope."

Demi Moore is Suzanne, who ends up as collateral damage when her husband, Mark (Dylan McDermott), is arrested on charges related to a shady stock deal. Suzanne’s community-service sentence involves reading to cranky Blind Bill, and they instantly clash, so of course they will soon be hot and heavy for each other, especially since Suzanne has been chafing under the thumb of her domineering husband.If that premise is wince-inducing, so is much of the dialogue. (The story is by Diane Fisher, the screenplay by John Buffalo Mailer; both Mailers are sons of Norman.) Mr. McDermott, especially, has a lot of clichés to mouth. The acting is nuance-free, and so is the story. As for the steaminess hinted at early on, it proves to have been just a tease. No sparks or clothes fly."

It’s no spoiler to say that the filmmakers start to believe that the organization is based on a fraud: The very first scene is of Ms. Heitz, stepping out of an interview with a parent who was said to have made such a sale — her first without Mr. Choothesa interpreting. Almost in a daze, she murmurs, “It’s all a big lie.”The film’s first half chronicles the events leading to that interview; the girls who live at the organization and go to school in Chiang Mai are bright and motivated, and glad for the opportunities their families in the hill tribes of Northern Thailand lack. But they later burst into tears when they hear how they and their families have been presented in materials to donor groups — put, as one says, in “the wrong light.”Even so, perhaps the families are denying the truth out of shame. The rest of the film tries to determine the facts, though questions remain. In the end, “The Wrong Light” is an engrossing cautionary tale teaching one of philanthropy’s oldest lessons: Caveat emptor."

In addition to directing midnight-movie classics like “El Topo” and “The Holy Mountain,” he has composed music and written many books. He is an expert on the tarot and psychotherapy. But in his two recent autobiographical films — “The Dance of Reality” and now “Endless Poetry” — Mr. Jodorowsky, at 88, shows the irrepressible energy of a man who is just getting started.The main character in “Endless Poetry” is exactly that: a 20-ish Alejandro (played by the director’s son Adan) discovering his literary vocation in Chile in the late 1940s. Burning with ambition and existential hunger, Alejandro makes his way through bohemian Santiago, collecting friends, lovers, mentors and muses among the city’s artists and writers. Some of their names — Nicanor Parra, Stella Díaz Varín and Enrique Lihn — can be found in the annals of 20th-century Chilean literature. Along with Pablo Larraín’s “Neruda,” this film would be a useful assignment in an introductory course on the subject.Not that there is anything remotely dry or academic about Mr. Jodorowsky’s approach to the story of his own life. “I’m going to save Surrealism,” his younger self declares, and “Endless Poetry” makes good on that vow with a barrage of improbable situations and bizarre, sometimes grotesque images. The most surreal effect may be the casting. Mr. Jodorowsky in his present gray-bearded state shows up to narrate, and in addition to Adan, another son, Brontis, appears onscreen, reprising the role of Alejandro’s bullying, insecure father, which he played in “The Dance of Reality.”That film was infused with the wonders and terrors of childhood, and was a tour de force of Freudian mischief and Felliniesque nostalgia. “Endless Poetry,” telling a more diffuse story, doesn’t reach quite the same level of intensity, but it is testament to the relentless energy and undimmed ingenuity of its creator and a moving defense of the prerogatives of the imagination.Realism is not on the agenda, but Mr. Jodorowsky nonetheless evokes the chaotic, passionate spirit of a time and offers astute insights into his own psychology. He uses masquerade, puppetry, theatrical lighting and set design and the luridly expressive cinematography of the great Christopher Doyle to create a world of hallucinatory artifice. Alejandro’s mother, Sara, who sings all her dialogue in fluting operatic tones, is played by Pamela Flores, who also plays Stella, the young poet’s beer-drinking, cigar-smoking protector and sort-of lover. This doubling is mirrored by the resemblance between Adan Jodorowsky and Leandro Taub, who plays Alejandro’s pal and sort-of rival Enrique Lihn.For all of these characters, poetry is fundamentally a sensual undertaking, and Mr. Jodorowsky is a voracious poet of the flesh. It’s too easy to describe his interest in unusually large and small bodies, in wounded and painted skin, in amputation and contortion as perverse, freakish or provocative. That language belongs to the patriarchal world of propriety and repression, against which Alejandro’s life is one long protest. The images in “Endless Poetry” are arresting and sometimes disturbing, but there is an earnest commitment to ecstasy and authenticity that renders moot any question of offensiveness or exploitation.Coherence may also be beside the point. “Endless Poetry” is never boring, but it has a tendency to meander and repeat itself. Mr. Jodorowsky is a poet in the broadest sense, a restless artist whose temperament isn’t wedded to any particular form. He seems to embrace cinema out of convenience. He can’t beam his visions directly into your brain, or tattoo his words on your body, but this is the next best thing."
"9459","False Confessions","",0,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: With ‘False Confessions,’ the Play’s Not Quite the Thing","Isabelle Huppert and Louis Garrel star in a screen version of an 18th-century Marivaux play and the last film directed by Luc Bondy.","2017-07-13",NA,"2017-11-02 04:16:45",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/movies/false-confessions-review-isabelle-huppert.html,Read the New York Times Review of False Confessions,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/14/arts/14FALSE/14FALSE-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"It must have been something to watch Isabelle Huppert, Louis Garrel and a handful of other French actors perform the 1737 comedy “The False Confessions” onstage, although what that something would have been is unclear from a movie based on the production. Written by Pierre de Marivaux (1688-1763), the play is one of those romantic intrigues involving charming paramours, scheming servants and much bustling in and out of rooms amid conspiratorial conversations. A Marivaux contemporary said that his only subject was “the eternal surprise of love,” though it seems doubtful anyone seeing this play was ever truly startled.A happy ending seems inevitable when the lovers are a beautiful, wealthy widow, Araminte (Ms. Huppert), and a handsome, insolvent gentleman, Dorante (Mr. Garrel) — at least in carefree pre-revolutionary France (and rich-girl/poor-boy Hollywood fantasies). They’re brought together by Dubois (Yves Jacques), Araminte’s servant, who was once Dorante’s valet. One of those wily, devoted domestics who greases the gears, Dubois has conspired to secure Dorante a position in Araminte’s household. Dorante is in love with Araminte, despite never having spoken to her, while she knows nothing of his love. The idea is that proximity will light the fire, fanned by secrets and lies and a lot of arch dialogue.The production of “The False Confessions” that Ms. Huppert and Mr. Garrel starred in was mounted in Paris at the Odéon Theater in 2014 and directed by Luc Bondy. Using the same cast and the Odéon as his set, Mr. Bondy directed this movie during the play’s run, shooting before evening curtain call. This surely was convenient, but the Odéon and its backstage spaces make an awkward backdrop, at least the way Mr. Bondy uses them. He’s fond of ungainly, pointless overhead shots that suggest he was trying to make the camera work in cramped spaces or maybe convey the view from the balcony.For some breathing room, the characters occasionally meet on a large terrace overlooking the street where passers-by, storefronts and restaurant signs give the movie tiny jolts of reality, like little puffs of oxygen. Every so often, they convene and scheme on the theater’s foyer stairway, which has been scattered with women’s shoes, a conceit seemingly borrowed from the production. In an apparent attempt to literalize the play’s self-declared deceits, Mr. Bondy draws attention to the artificiality of the location — you’re always aware this takes place in a theater — a contrivance that’s matched by brittle, outsize performances that turn faces into masks of surprise, sorrow and so on.Mr. Bondy, a well-regarded theater director with a few films on his résumé, died in December 2015 and, according to the movie’s production notes, his wife, Marie-Louise Bischofberger, helped finish “False Confessions.” It’s impossible to know if this is the movie he wanted to make or not. Some online clips from the stage production suggest that it might have been pleasurable to watch Ms. Huppert and Mr. Garrel in person, and perhaps their charisma enlivened what comes across onscreen as impossibly stale. Mr. Bondy’s death lends inevitable pathos to the movie, but, alas, there is little to recommend here, even for Huppert completists who follow her anywhere."

In this British movie, a young 19th-century woman finds passion, makes mischief and commits murder.","2017-07-13","2017-07-14","2017-11-02 04:18:27",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/movies/lady-macbeth-review.html,Read the New York Times Review of Lady Macbeth,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/14/arts/14LADYMAC/14LADYMAC-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"It takes a while to figure out who the title character in “Lady Macbeth” really is. You may think you know her, that she’s the one who sleeps with death, the one pouring evil into her husband’s ear. Certainly the invocation of Shakespeare tips that there’s something dangerous about the lady of its house, an opaque beauty called Katherine (a very fine Florence Pugh). Yet part of this movie’s ticklish nastiness is that at first it isn’t at all clear whether she will be the master of doom or its helpmate. At just 17, Katherine looks like the innocent flower, but something wicked this way comes seductively, then savagely.Set in 1865 rural England, “Lady Macbeth” opens with Katherine at the marriage altar, her head draped in a white veil that suggests virtue and slyly hints at the blood that will spill. She’s soon in the bedroom with her husband, Alexander (Paul Hilton), a scowler with angry, accusatory eyes who isn’t interested in her sexually or any other way. Their first night together, he brusquely orders her to undress, only to crawl into bed, leaving her naked, untouched and puzzled. This remains the template for a somewhat mysteriously cheerless, loveless marriage that finds Katherine more of a prisoner than a wife.Not much happens at first, beautifully. Katherine is soon bored, but the director, William Oldroyd, ensures that you aren’t, with his use of sepulchral quiet, mesmerizingly steady framing and unnerving order, in which nothing is ever out of place, especially nothing human. There seem to be no books in the house, which is maintained by beaten-down servants and overseen by Alexander’s even more unpleasant father, Boris (a good Christopher Fairbank). Everything looks superficially lovely, especially Katherine, who is brushed and cinched, primped and readied by her maid, Anna (Naomi Ackie), like a doll that no one plays with. It’s unclear if Katherine can read; at times she barely speaks.For the most part, Katherine watches, and we watch her watching, as the quiet grows louder, and the stillness grows eerier. Bidden to stay indoors — somehow the fresh air would be bad for her, or so the men of the house insist — she spends much of her time staring out a window, a familiar pastime for repressed, yearning women in fiction. Of Madame Bovary, the theorist Stephen Heath wrote: “The window is the frame of Emma’s dissatisfaction.” The same holds true for Katherine, whose window reveals the life that she’s been cut off from, even as it reminds her, day after lonely night, of the freedom on the other side of the glass.Something happens, of course, rocking Katherine, the story and the visual order. Alexander leaves — there’s trouble at the family colliery — creating a void that she rapidly fills. She starts a bold, increasingly reckless affair with a groomsman, Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), a rough number wildly out of his league and depth. Adultery soon begets murder, but even when Katherine is standing over a second corpse, it’s not obvious whether she’s a newly sprung prisoner of gender with a reasonable sociopolitical alibi (the patriarchy made her do it!) or just a psychopath in a fetching peacock-blue gown. Mr. Oldroyd doesn’t tip his hand, forcing you to choose.The movie is based on “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,” an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov that Dmitri Shostakovich turned into an opera and Andrzej Wajda adapted into a film. Like the novella, the movie opens up some interpretive leeway as it invites your sympathy for Katherine. She’s an unambiguous captive, trapped by sex and class, yet the viciousness that her liberation awakens — as carnal lust slips into bloodlust — precludes a facile redemptive reading. Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals, imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen, a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast.Written by Alice Birch, this version of “Lady Macbeth” is most successfully complicated by Anna, a sympathetic character who doesn’t exist in the novella but takes on mounting importance here. Katherine, having been radically isolated by her husband and father-in-law, has no friends. Anna is Katherine’s closest companion by default and serves as maid and occasional minder; over time, Anna also becomes a moving, horrified witness to Katherine’s crimes, emotion that warms the insistent chill. That Anna is played by a black actress, and Katherine by a white one, adds race to the thickening intrigue, making a story of female oppression and domination, power and privilege that much more harrowing and ugly."

Each report casts a bit more light, but a complete understanding and a solution remain elusive.“Almost Sunrise,” a documentary by Michael Collins about two Iraq war veterans who take a 2,700-mile walk, adds to the canvas primarily by deepening the picture of what troubles many veterans. The layman might assume it’s the types of anxiety associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, an impression fueled by all that harrowing footage we’ve seen of soldiers walking or driving through landscapes dotted with hidden explosives. But this film explores the “moral injury” that some veterans wrestle with, a different kind of reaction that includes guilt or shame about what they did or witnessed.We learn about this through the journey of Tom Voss and Anthony Anderson, who in 2013 and 2014 walked to California from Wisconsin, partly to raise awareness of veterans’ issues but largely to try to subdue their own demons. Mr. Voss says matter-of-factly as he explains the temptation he has felt to kill himself, “It’s a really enticing option, to not have to think about horrible things on a daily basis.”The film pushes a type of therapeutic meditation to treat this sort of trauma, a technique explored in the final segment, after the men have completed the walk. This portion of the documentary, though, is light on details. We’re left once again feeling we’ve had only a glimmer of illumination on a vexingly complex problem."

The thesis here is that, after Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, opponents of the decision spent the next 40 years organizing an incremental offensive on multiple fronts to restrict access to abortion, contraception and sterilization by piling on state regulations and putting forward political candidates to further their cause.The anti-abortion talking heads in the film do not deny the strategy, nor do they get much of the spotlight. This documentary, directed by Civia Tamarkin and written by Ms. Tamarkin and Luchina Fisher, argues that new laws have stripped away health services unrelated to abortion and have deprived women, particularly those with lower incomes, of routine care. While women’s clinics and providers were attacked by violent extremists and closed as funding dried up, more insidious, less publicized changes, including the legislation and the mergers and acquisitions that brought hospitals under the control of religious groups, were having far-reaching effects.The case histories are stacked to support the film’s point of view, but that doesn’t make them less painful. Worst are the new mothers jailed on child-abuse charges because of drug tests administered without their knowledge. The victims are the babies, left motherless. One woman had to wait out a nonviable pregnancy because the law forbade inducing labor after 20 weeks. A single mother with several children was denied sterilization surgery because of a hospital’s religious beliefs; Medicaid limited her providers, and she could not afford to travel to a distant clinic. Their stories illustrate the consequences of these developments, some of them perhaps unintended, but frightening nonetheless."

I’ll tread lightly, but I don’t think anything I say here can spoil its power.Two groups of humans have just battled, and the victors, having slaughtered the enemy, burst into raucous cheers. It’s the kind of thing we’ve seen in movies dozens of times before: the cheapening of mass death into an easy win for the good guys. Except that in this case we, the humans in the theater seats, are not the only ones watching. A crowd of apes is also present, an emerging society whose national epic this film and its companions have marvelously and improbably become. The apes pause to witness the aftermath of the carnage they have narrowly escaped, and their wordless, shocked response, registered above all on the face of Caesar, their leader, is an eloquent rebuke to a species that has abandoned any but a biological claim to the name human.Recall that “ape not kill ape” is the political and moral foundation of ape civilization, handed down by Caesar, their Moses, though he hasn’t always obeyed this commandment. The spectacle of people’s rejoicing in the destruction of their own kind is upsetting, and as the audience absorbs the apes’ shock, we become aware of another, deeper unease. We are now, three movies into this reborn franchise, entirely on the side of the apes. The prospect of our own extinction, far from horrifying, comes as a relief. At last the poor planet will catch a break.Or, to put it another way, Koba was right.If you saw “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” — the second chapter in the series so far, bridging “Rise” and “War” — you may recall that poor, abused laboratory chimp’s evolution from victim to nemesis. The damage Koba had suffered at the hands of humans made him intolerant and fanatical, an embodiment of political extremism who needed to be checked, and ultimately destroyed, by Caesar, whose political temperament tended toward moderation and compromise. Their conflict was mirrored by a struggle on the human side between a genocidal, ape-hating military commander and a rival leader who believed in coexistence.“Dawn,” like “Rise” before it, rested on a hopeful, slightly hokey message of interspecies harmony. In spite of their differences and mutual suspicions, maybe the two primate societies, one coalescing while the other slid toward chaos, could share the Earth, or at least the stretch of Northern California forest where this franchise plants its allegorical flag.VideoAndy Serkis (famously known as Gollum in “The Lord of the Rings”) reprises his role as the talking chimpanzee Caesar in ""War for the Planet of the Apes.""Published OnJuly 14, 2017Times change. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” directed by Matt Reeves, is the grimmest episode so far, and also the strongest, a superb example — rare in this era of sloppily constructed, commercially hedged cinematic universes — of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking. The distinction of this run of “Planet of the Apes” movies has been its commitment to the venerable belief that science fiction belongs to the literature of ideas, and its willingness to risk seeming to take itself too seriously. Each episode has pursued a stark ethical or political problem, and each has shifted the moral ground from human to ape.“Rise” was about how people treat and mistreat animals, about the tension between recognizing them as sentient beings and the long habit of exploiting and confining them. “Dawn” was a wishful parable of decolonization and counterinsurgency, concerned with the competing but equally legitimate claims of two tribes occupying adjacent territory. “War” — which, in spite of its title, is less a war film than a western wrapped around a prison movie — vindicates Koba’s view of humanity as irredeemably cruel and deceitful.The memory of Koba’s own treachery is kept alive, as some of his followers have drifted from militant anti-Caesarism to collaboration with the enemy species. There is a new nemesis in town, a renegade colonel played by Woody Harrelson, who goes full Heart of Darkness, staging a one-man remake of “Apocalypse Now” in a medical base he has refashioned into a concentration camp. He has Marlon Brando’s clean-shaven dome, Robert Duvall’s mirrored sunglasses and Dennis Hopper’s manic verbosity. The horror! The horror!Really, though, it’s a lot of fun, in spite of the somber picture I’ve been painting. Mr. Reeves, who also directed “Dawn,” has a dark vision, but also a light touch when necessary, and, above all, a commitment to creating a world that is coherent as well as fantastical. This world is also intensely and somewhat unimaginatively masculine. The default setting for primate social organization in these movies, human and otherwise, is patriarchal, and while a few female apes and a young human girl appear on screen, the filmmakers’ inability to flesh out the familial and affective dimensions of an otherwise richly rendered reality is frustrating.But still, the motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up. Andy Serkis’s performance as Caesar is one of the marvels of modern screen acting, and it’s complemented by those of Karin Konoval, reprising her role as the wise orangutan Maurice, and Steve Zahn, as a sad-clown sidekick named Bad Ape.Caesar and Maurice communicate in primitive English and sign language, and for long stretches their adventures unfold without much human interaction, though they do adopt a mute human orphan (Amiah Miller) shortly before they meet Bad Ape. Our ilk is in a bad way, and not only because of the fanatical, desperate militarism represented by the Colonel. A new strain of virus is robbing people of their ability to speak, accelerating a reversal of species hierarchy set in motion two movies ago when Caesar first howled the word “no.”He is a grayer, sadder hero now, and in “War” he succumbs for a while to a vengeful impulse at odds with his essential high-mindedness. You could say that he is putting his humanity at risk, or that he’s only human, after all, but of course both descriptions would be absurd. We’ll have to come up with a new vocabulary, but while we still have this one — and while flesh-and-blood people are still directing digital gorillas and chimps — I’ll just say that it’s good to see a movie so thoroughly humane."

The sight of her working up a sweat in this fashion is what audience members initially see as they file into the performance space where her solo show is being staged, and she continues for quite some time after they are seated.“When something is going on for so long, there’s a transformation,” she explains in an interview that is intercut throughout the director Andrew Rossi’s documentary, also called “Bronx Gothic,” about Ms. Okpokwasili and her work.The stage piece (reviewed in The New York Times in 2014) uses dance, song and spoken word, combined with various forms of stagecraft. Ms. Okpokwasili’s fearless writing and intense, virtuosic performance style make the story, of two black girls discovering their sexuality while growing up in the Bronx, seem torn from her own life. (The piece is not autobiographical, however.) Ideas of female and black beauty are explored with language that is frequently profane — hardly any of it is quotable here — and always charged. The narrative unfolds via a series of letters Ms. Okpokwasili reads from, but her words are punctuated by movements that are at times balletic, at other times pure James Brown meets punk rock. She hits the stage floor hard, and more than once.The movie shows her interacting with audience members in Q. and A. sessions during a tour of the piece, doting on her lovely daughter and having pointed discussions about race with her husband, Peter Born — who is white and also the director of the stage work. These scenes are interesting and sometimes genuinely illuminating. Mr. Born can be a bit pedantic when speaking with his wife about “black victimhood” in popular culture, citing “12 Years a Slave” as an example that seems to irritate him.Ms. Okpokwasili doesn’t say much in response, but her face indicates a certain impatience with Mr. Born’s view. Later in the film the family visits Ms. Okpokwasili’s parents, who are Nigerian immigrants. They are somewhat hesitant to watch a video of their daughter’s piece. Once they do, though, Ms. Okpokwasili’s mother likens her daughter’s style of movement to Nigerian dance, and gives a demonstration that’s both moving and revealing.In the end, Ms. Okpokwasili’s often academic-sounding exegeses of her work become repetitive. Given the aesthetically confrontational nature of the piece, one can understand why Mr. Rossi did not attempt an undiluted cinematic translation of the complete “Bronx Gothic.” But something about his approach (which I assume was approved by Ms. Okpokwasili, as she is one of the movie’s executive producers) feels, finally, like an evasion."

The film takes its name from a Muddy Waters song, but he is mentioned only in passing, a onetime colleague of several musicians featured here, mainly regional heroes who eke out livings playing the juke joints that still make up the chitlin’ circuit. Less of a solemn pilgrimage than a folksy visit, this film is a chance to set a spell, watch longtime musicians play and boast and reflect about their lives on and off the road.Mr. Cross’s guide is Bobby Rush, who after more than 60 years in the business won his first Grammy this year, for best traditional blues album. Mr. Rush is amiable company, quick with stories about playing for next to nothing in the 1950s and ’60s. Some business hazards are eternal: We see a promoter crying poor and shortchanging Mr. Rush just before one showtime.Mr. Cross makes a home base of sorts out of Blue Front Cafe in Bentonia, Miss. The owner, Jimmy Duck Holmes, sings with a deep, soulful phrasing as he casually picks on an acoustic guitar. Other musicians, many in their 80s, also make appearances: the harpist Lazy Lester, the guitarist Lil’ Buck Sinegal, the pianist Henry Gray. Barbara Lynn smiles at the memory of making “You’ll Lose a Good Thing,” her No. 1 R&B hit in 1962, at the age of 20: “That song took me everywhere.”Bluesmen gather for jam sessions in homes, at crawfish boils, at senior centers. But the traditions are not being passed on, and the music’s prospects, at least in its birthplace, are not bullish. “It’ll be here,” Bud Spires, a harmonica player says, “until the last old man shuts his eyes.” By the end of this sweet-hearted elegy, Mr. Cross has shown us Mr. Spires’s grave site."

You may find yourself championing its subjects even while feeling confounded by the omission of details by its filmmaker.Subtitled “Life in Resistance,” this documentary, the last in a trilogy of films directed by Pamela Yates (“When the Mountains Tremble,” from 1983; “Granito: How to Nail a Dictator,” from 2011), is itself split into several parts. Starting with the 2013 genocide trial of Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, a former president of Guatemala, it moves into land disputes involving the Maya people, then to citizen protests in 2015 that helped bring down the presidency of Otto Pérez Molina amid a corruption scandal.Along the way Ms. Yates touches on indigenous rights issues, political deceit, civil disobedience and several other topics, including the country’s courts. (The justice system there is “an enormous beast,” one woman says. It is a “monster dressed in a suit, tie and shiny shoes.”) The director presumes viewers already have a firm knowledge of recent Guatemalan events, as well as a familiarity with the land’s makeup and history; only a few clarifying facts and supporting materials are provided. This is a movie interested in broad statements, like the above, rather than specific points.Unlike the recent powerful documentary “Finding Oscar,” which illuminated a major Guatemalan tragedy by focusing on an individual story, “500 Years” dives right into bigger pictures. That approach feels too wide-ranging for a single film, but Ms. Yates’s zeal is heartfelt, and the optimism of her interviewees is uplifting. Even when there’s little hard data, there’s some real energy."

There, Harun — the inspiration for a caliph in “One Thousand and One Nights” — is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves. Raqqa’s later history largely registers as more mundane, a tale of declines and revivals that turned catastrophic when the Islamic State, or ISIS, seized it in 2014, making the city its effective capital. American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins.“City of Ghosts,” a blunt instrument of a documentary, is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically, it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, or R.B.S.S., a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R.B.S.S.’s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is “a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” toward civilians in that city.)Directed by Matthew Heineman, “City of Ghosts” primarily focuses on three R.B.S.S. activists identified by their first names — Aziz, Hamoud and Mohamad — who, even after being forced to flee Raqqa, intently work to get images and information about the city out into the world. Mr. Heineman, who is also the movie’s cinematographer, more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York, where R.B.S.S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It’s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, at the podium.“City of Ghosts” is best when it lets the activists tell their own stories, which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over, in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It’s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (“we started to scream for freedom”), and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way, Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes, glossing over Syria’s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS.The activists come across as ordinary men made extraordinary by circumstance; some seem almost surprised at where life and war have taken them. Aziz was a student who became a spokesman, and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter, but not much else about the group’s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane, or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman, an excitingly visceral director — his last documentary was “Cartel Land” — thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie, R.B.S.S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted.That’s unfortunate because more information and in-depth analysis, as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images, might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In “City of Ghosts,” Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material — including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery — into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism, one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political. You admire Aziz, Hamoud, Mohamad and their partisan compatriots. And soon you fear for them too, worrying over their every move as they fight an enemy that is scarily near. Yet as these men come into the focus, Raqqa and the region recede.As the activists struggle to keep Raqqa alive for the world, funneling news to outside agencies, the dead in this movie — decapitated, crucified, shot — come close to overwhelming the living. In a few instances, Mr. Heineman shows men being shot point blank in the head; elsewhere, he cuts way before the fatal moment, which turns these murders into appalling cinematic cliffhangers. He seems to believe that it’s crucial to include numerous unfiltered ISIS atrocities, but raw and blurred versions of savagery prove this false. Mr. Heineman is clearly passionate and sincere, but he doesn’t fully grasp the power of suggestion or the audience’s capacity for empathy. You don’t need to watch a man die to understand the horror of his death."

The movie opens with an overhead shot of a desktop cluttered with applications and head shots of teenagers paper-clipped to them, and the chatter of adults arguing for and against their favored kids. They seem like Olympian gods trying to determine which mortals they want to mess with.As it happens, they are instructors at a prestigious New Zealand drama academy. The movie descends to earth, so to speak, to find Stanley (James Rolleston), a handsome, bright-eyed, but not particularly extroverted first-year student at the school, sharing a bus seat with Isolde (Ella Edward), an attractive girl a few years his junior, who is off to tennis lessons. The two chat awkwardly and when Isolde gets off the bus, the movie unexpectedly follows her, and shows her walking in on a sexual liaison between a teenage girl and an older tennis coach.The student is Isolde’s sister, and the tennis instructor is rather famous, and a scandal ensues. Stanley learns about it via a TV screen while he is bartending to pay his school bills. The movie takes an oblique, almost offhand approach to narrative for its first hour. It focuses on the quotidian details of life among a group of talented students and demanding, sometimes capricious and cruel teachers, the most vivid of whom, Hannah (Kerry Fox), has taken an interest in Stanley.Eventually the plot threads tighten, and it becomes clear that there’s some trouble ahead. Stanley engages in a tentative romance with Isolde while developing, with his assigned group of classmates, a theater piece about the sex scandal — knowing all the while that the other party in the incident is Isolde’s older sister.As the movie flits from month to month of the drama school’s term (the sometimes abrupt titles signaling the changes of date are reminiscent of those in Kubrick’s “The Shining”), it convincingly conveys the raw feelings that result when life and art rub too fiercely against each other, and how the wounds are that much more severe when you add adolescence to the mix. “The Rehearsal” also accomplishes the tricky task of demonstrating how actors with plain talent and little more gain credibility with training and polish. Mr. Rolleston is not the only performer in the film required to show this metamorphosis, but he is the most impressive.Ms. Maclean frames her shots in casually elegant wide-screen, often leaving big empty spaces in the middle of the composition while a telling detail looks out at the viewer from a far corner. Similarly, a narrative development involving a character who acts as a catalytic agent in certain scenes brings a different set of concerns to the movie’s forefront, and could catch a viewer off guard; it’s clearly meant to.And yet at the end Ms. Maclean forsakes all the unsettling subtlety and nuance she has had so clearly in her command to serve up a finale that I found frankly confounding, despite its having been foreshadowed. Your mileage may vary, but for myself “The Rehearsal” delivers a good hour and a half of engagement and intrigue only to top it off with a cherry that left me asking “Really?”"

Implausibly, three outsiders are also on hand: a children’s book author (a strong Connie Nielsen); a rock star (Johan Heldenbergh); and an Italian monk and writer, Roberto Salus (Toni Servillo), who has temporarily abandoned his vow of silence for the occasion.After an evening in which the singer serenades the group with “Walk on the Wild Side,” Roché invites Salus to his room to have him hear his confession. The next morning, Roché is found dead, asphyxiated by a plastic bag that belonged to Salus. An investigation among the attendees grants Mr. Andò the opportunity to pursue pithy, discursive exchanges about power, austerity and capitalism amid high-end accommodations and a tasteful classical soundtrack.The hero here is Salus (played by Mr. Servillo with an omnisicient assurance), whom the guests confide in and plumb for information. The officials swim in a fancy pool; the ascetic Salus prefers the ocean. They worry about economies; he captures bird songs on a miniature recorder. He, of course, has much to teach them, in sentences more laden with quiet gravity than philosophical heft.Despite Salus’s pleas for compassion, he wears the vestments of organized religion, which has often found itself as guilty of historical abuses as the I.M.F. or any G-8 nation, and is perhaps not the first place to look for the savior of the Western world."

Some have sensory issues with touch and sound. That’s all the more reason to have the Jersey Hammerheads, the Special Olympics swimming team Mr. McQuay founded with his wife, Maria, inspired by Mikey, their son.Mikey, one of the Hammerheads’ stars, is among the three principal subjects of “Swim Team,” a documentary by Lara Stolman. (An excerpt from the movie appeared on The New York Times’s website in 2015.) The others are Robbie, who says he aspires to be faster than Michael Phelps, and Kelvin, who has Tourette’s syndrome in addition to autism.Made over the course of two years, the documentary follows the challenges they face, both personally and as a group. (We’ll avoid spoiling which one went on to compete nationally and which one became captain of his high school swim team.) The movie also trails their parents, who raise their children — mostly teenagers — without a rule book, at times feeling isolated themselves, but finding camaraderie in one another. Near the end, Mr. McQuay says he believes that having an autistic son made him a more attentive father.Issue documentaries often struggle to come across as movies, not simply as informational tools. At its most effective, “Swim Team” treats its subjects as would any sports movie attuned to character and drama. There is real suspense when Robbie runs late for a meet, risking setting back his entire team.Later, Maria and Michael believe that the Hammerheads have come in first at a meet and are upset to see them receive only participation medals. (They soon realize that they lost the gold because one of the team’s members — not among the three profiled — earned a disqualification for starting a race with the wrong stroke.)Elsewhere, “Swim Team” deals more specifically with autism. Maria and Michael meet with a lawyer to determine whether they should seek guardianship of Mikey, who at 18 would otherwise be regarded as an adult by New Jersey. In an uncomfortably candid conversation, Robbie’s mother sits down to explain to him that he’s autistic, something he doesn’t already know. (“Do you see yourself different from the regular kids in school?” she asks.)While watching “Swim Team,” it’s worth remembering that even the smallest documentary crews aren’t invisible. Kelvin’s mother tells us that he becomes nervous in public places when people stare at him. Sure enough, there are gawkers when they shop at a Goodwill store. In fairness to the onlookers, some may not be staring because of Kelvin’s tics, but because Kelvin is being filmed — hardly an everyday occurrence.But “Swim Team” mostly aims to educate and inspire; on those counts, it succeeds."

But that’s to her advantage: With remarkable consistency, she has imbued her work with close observation, measured pacing and quiet gravity. Her latest drama, “Our Time Will Come,” a story of the Hong Kong underground during the Japanese occupation in World War II, upholds her high standard with its account of the making of a resistance fighter.An earnest primary-school teacher, Fang Lan (Zhou Xun), lives with her mother (Deanie Ip) in Hong Kong, and finds herself single when her boyfriend, Wing (Wallace Huo Chienhwa), decides to work for the Japanese. Fang’s awakening arrives after seeing how a visiting intellectual she admires is smuggled to safety by members of the Dongjiang guerrillas, who conduct campaigns against the Japanese. Recruited by the group’s rebel leader (Eddie Peng Yuyan, impressive as a dashing man of action), Fang eventually becomes a leader herself, whose spine and commitment are tested when her mother foolheartedly assumes a mission.The story is framed by present-day black-and-white passages in which an aging war veteran (the Hong Kong superstar Tony Leung, excellent) recalls Fang’s valor. Tense sequences of undercover operations are reminiscent of those in Jean-Pierre Melville’s “Army of Shadows,” while moments of explosive violence have a “Godfather”-like immediacy. But it’s Fang’s transformation, embodied by Ms. Zhou’s lean, cool authority, that carries the most weight, lending the proceedings an unforced feminist dimension, and reaffirming Ms. Hui’s status as one of China’s cinematic treasures."

But maybe the dead have feelings, too. That, when you think about it, is the premise of a great many ghost stories, and also of “A Ghost Story,” David Lowery’s ingenious and affecting new film.The specter whose story this is — let’s call him Ghostie, since even when he’s alive we never learn his name — indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves, makes light bulbs flicker, opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale, crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum.The effect of all of this on the viewer is strange and intense but not exactly scary in the expected horror-movie manner. In an age of expanded, digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility, Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true, low-tech, Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement, but basically a 6-year-old’s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent), and infer a brooding, smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside — or at least the person Ghostie used to be — is Casey Affleck.Before his transformation into the title character, Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara — her character is also unnamed — live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving, but otherwise they pursue a low-key, harmonious, semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender, tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story — abstract, almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie’s troubled consciousness.The couple’s brief time together sets a hushed, poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which “A Ghost Story” will operate. Not that there aren’t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you’ve cracked the film’s circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician, Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules, but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence.Ghostie is not the only one of his kind in the movie. The dead (at least some of them) can communicate directly with one another and passive aggressively with the living. They can travel in time but not in space, which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene, even though they seem to inhabit, albeit invisibly, the same physical world we do. After a while, Ghostie’s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It’s the only one he has, and he’s been wearing it for a very long time.And time — the ways it can accelerate through years, freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether — is Mr. Lowery’s chief preoccupation here, his major theme and his raw material. At one point, early in her bereavement, Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on, she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating, without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes, which feels like an eternity. Eternity, though, is poor Ghostie’s problem.For him the calendar and the clock have no meaning, and as the film proceeds, growing darker and stranger, we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don’t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. “A Ghost Story” is suspenseful, dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart’s musical score is full of pathos and longing, compensating — maybe almost overcompensating — for the literal deadpan of the protagonist.The movie may be built around a conceptual gimmick, but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery’s other recent films, the gloomy Southern crime story “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet, borderline-twee remake of the ’70s children’s weepie “Pete’s Dragon.” “A Ghost Story” works so well because it shouldn’t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf, it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve, yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It’s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever, a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft.Movies these days are abuzz with all kinds of paranormal activity, most of it aimed at delivering easy, superficial terror. The scariest scene in “A Ghost Story” may be the most human, when a random guy at a party won’t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude, we know! Shut up! Ghostie’s silence at that moment speaks volumes, and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust, irrational response to him and his kind. We fear what we don’t understand, and a ghost is only human, after all."

Patty, though, can’t seem to conquer the kiddie-pageant circuit that Leanne forces her into, and so, desperate for attention and money, Leanne concocts a scheme to have the girl abducted — just long enough for the family to become media darlings.Skeet Ulrich is the former boyfriend she charms into doing the job, Jon Daly is Leanne’s hapless husband, and Kristen Schaal is a reporter who senses that something is fishy. The cast is surely capable of sharper comedy, but Will Raee, who directed, doesn’t get everyone on the same page. Ms. Cardellini and Ms. Schaal offer cardboard caricatures, while Mr. Ulrich, among others, plays it mostly straight.Craig Robinson, as the reluctant sidekick to Mr. Ulrich’s character, has the film’s only genuine moments as he bonds with his young captive. Once he saw the chemistry between Mr. Robinson and Ms. Parker, Mr. Raee (who also wrote the story, with Brenna Graziano doing the screenplay) should have jettisoned his original idea and let those two take over the tale. Alas, he didn’t."

I know better than to take it personally when this kind of thing happens, but I do often wonder why it does happen. Usually the studio (Warner Bros. in this case) thinks it has a turkey on its hands, but sometimes it doesn’t know quite what it has, and sneaks an interesting movie into theaters more or less by mistake. That seems to have been the case this time.Based on trailers and the durable, slightly stale charm of its stars, “The House” might be mistaken for a genial, silly movie about nice people making questionable decisions. Instead, it is a dark, startlingly bloody journey into the bitter, empty, broken heart of the American middle class, a blend of farce and satire built on a foundation of social despair.It all starts innocently enough. Scott and Kate Johansen (Mr. Ferrell and Ms. Poehler) are visiting Bucknell University with their daughter, Alex (Ryan Simpkins). Mom and Dad are lovey, clingy, goofy Gen-X parents, and their kid is a high-achieving, deadpan millennial. Some borderline-inappropriate jokes are cracked and you brace yourself for 90 more minutes of semi-awkward, underwritten, marshmallow-soft humor featuring people who have been funnier elsewhere.But then Alex loses her scholarship and her parents face a not-all-that-exaggerated version of the struggle that confronts so many families. “It’s $50 million!” Scott exclaims when he sees the tuition bill. The poor math skills that seemed at first like an arbitrary character trait were more likely invented to enable that very joke. It might as well be $50 million. Suddenly this couple, with a big house in a pleasant, generic suburban town, find themselves in a state of abject desperation.ImageAmy Poehler, middle-class mom and casino proprietor.CreditWarner Brothers PicturesSo they team up with their pal Frank (Jason Mantzoukas) whose gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage and his self-esteem. He hopes to win back his estranged wife, Raina (Michaela Watkins) and persuades Scott and Kate to open an illegal casino in his half-empty mini-mansion. The business plan is straightforward: The house always wins.If “The House” had been made in the ’70s, it would have reveled in the grimness of the Johansens’ circumstances and exploited the moral tawdriness of their response to it. What is most unnerving about the way their story is presented here — Andrew Jay Cohen directed, and wrote the script with Brendan O’Brien — is the absence of that kind of dramatic intensity. Scott and Kate do some terrible things, and induce their friends and neighbors to misbehave in sometimes frightening ways. Scott mutilates someone with an ax. More than one person, actually. In addition to blackjack and roulette, the casino features an occasional fight club, in which upstanding folks pair off and beat each other bloody as their fellow burghers wager money on the outcome.The thing that will dismay some tenderhearted viewers — and that may have spooked the distributor — is the film’s steely refusal of hypocrisy. You wait for the moment of comeuppance or redemption, for the restoration of right and wrong, but no such moment arrives. The pop-culture references and musical cues that pepper the action are not as ironic as they may seem. Scenes from “The Walking Dead” and snatches of Snoop Dogg’s “Gz and Hustlas” and the “Sopranos” theme song provide clues about the reality that Kate and Scott are only partly aware they inhabit.The town’s political leadership (represented by Nick Kroll) is greedy and corrupt. Law enforcement (represented by Rob Huebel) is stupid and belligerent. The casino becomes not only a place of recreation but also the only place where civic interactions among the citizens seem possible. It also reveals the true face of a society divided into predators and prey, the house and the suckers.The only way to protect yourself and the people you love is to pick the right side. That seems shockingly cynical, but there is something admirable in a movie that examines some of the worst aspects of modern American life with blunt, good-humored honesty. We’re not nice people. You can bet on that."

An issue touched on in that picture was the banning of music by the jihadists. And one of the performers in it was a real-life singer, songwriter and guitarist, Fatoumata Diawara. “Mali Blues,” a new documentary directed by Lutz Gregor, tells the real-life story of Ms. Diawara and three other major Malian musicians as they collaborate in the capital city, Bamako.Bassekou Kouyaté plays a ngoni, a wooden instrument from which, he explains in one scene, the Western banjo was derived. He puts his instrument’s sound through a wah-wah pedal, adding a psychedelic aura to its already spiritual tone. He speaks of the griot tradition, while the younger Master Soumy embraces what he sees as the innate opposition of rap. Ahmed Ag Kaedi, a Tuareg guitarist with a gorgeous fluid tone, tells of having his equipment burned and his family told by jihadists that if they caught up with him, they would cut off his fingers. In one of the movie’s most lyrical scenes, Mr. Kaedi and Ms. Diawara improvise a song together; Mr. Kaedi’s pessimistic lyrics state “We got a curse and it won’t go away” while Ms. Diawara sings of “sounds that unite.”Despite the urgency of the situation the musicians face, when they’re not doing their work, the movie is quiet, observant, taking in the austere beauty of the land and the people. In a blink-and-you-miss-it shot, a young girl is seen crossing a dirt road, leading a younger boy with one hand and holding a machete in the other. It provokes a shudder, while the scenes in which the musicians play together elicit jubilation."

Once more, it spins on Peter Parker (the nice, boyish Tom Holland), a teenager who develops super-skills after he’s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable, amusing “Spider-Man: Homecoming” indicates that this is a return, though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can’t go home again, but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options.“Homecoming” is more or less about how Peter Parker needs to stay forever young, ideally 15 or so years old. What’s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he’s a kid, if one who can spin big, sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop, comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying, magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and, ideally, work as a character, giving him an off-kilter charm, is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps, he is also a teenage boy — that’s his Kryptonite, what cuts him down to recognizable human size.The team behind “Homecoming” certainly gets that Spider-Man is a kid, even if the movie plays the naïf angle too hard at times, making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly, a borderline dumb cluck. The movie — credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts — opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He’s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers, which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It’s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine, which is why he’s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel’s Iron Man, a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who pops in and out).That machine, known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is vast, complicated, lucrative and ever-expanding. It’s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality, but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so, after stumbling with its first “Spider-Man” resurrection, it cut a deal with Marvel, which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it’s modestly amusing to consider that Sony, much like Peter Parker here, needed help getting off the ground again, and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide.VideoJon Watts narrates a scene featuring Tom Holland, Marisa Tomei and Jacob Batalon.Published OnJuly 7, 2017CreditCreditChuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures EntertainmentFor its initial hour, “Homecoming” moves along breezily enough, though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light, good-natured story of a teenager who’s navigating through, and often badly fumbling, the competing demands of school, home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing.Mr. Watts’s previous features include “Cop Car,” a slick, small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera, is good with actors and has a sadistic streak, which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. “Cop Car” is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it’s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in “Homecoming,” even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei’s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece.It’s tough to know who the biggest creative force is in a corporate entity like “Homecoming” and how much Mr. Watts contributed to its look, vibe and feel. The movie isn’t visually distinctive over all, and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground, as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans, the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster, particularly in the age of ambitious, eye-stroking diversions like “Doctor Strange.” It’s hard to think of a single image in “Homecoming” that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.’s tender, topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi’s first “Spider-Man.”And then there’s Michael Keaton, who’s so very good in “Homecoming” that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older, more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture, the regulation baddie, who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind, with the usual yelling, minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers’ steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal décor, but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton’s aerial acrobatics in “Batman” and “Birdman.”The Vulture is a mess of prickly contradictions, only some of which seem intentional. His criminality, rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton, with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes, makes him a memorably angry man, not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark’s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man, who — as this movie reminds you — is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here, Spidey is eager to do a billionaire’s bidding, partly because he’s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up, who will he fight for and why?"

It all seems so long ago, and yet it also feels as if it were happening right now. The television journalists with their trench coats and stentorian inflections. The president on horseback. “Evil Empire.” “Trust, but verify.” “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”But for viewers seeking either to refresh their memories of, or to learn something new about, the 40th president, this documentary, directed by Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez and made up of ’80s-vintage archival video, will prove puzzling and unsatisfying. It dwells, as people often did back then, on the remarkable fact that Reagan had been an actor in Hollywood, but it does not chronicle the path that took him from the movies to the California governor’s mansion on his way to the White House.Nor does it deal with his campaigns, or with his role in the ideological transformation of American politics. Domestic policy is all but invisible. There is nothing about tax cuts, supply-side economics, the air traffic controllers’ strike, AIDS or the Supreme Court. No Grenada, no El Salvador, no Lebanon. The Iran-contra scandal gets a bit of attention, but only as a sidebar to the film’s main preoccupation, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.That is a great and consequential story, of course, and focusing on it saves “The Reagan Show” from triviality. The improbable diplomatic bromance between Reagan, an unbending anti-Communist, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reform-minded general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, yielded many memorable moments on the public stage. Their negotiation of an arms treaty also provides a rare and encouraging example of successful peacemaking between rival countries. While thin on strategic or historical analysis, the film does provide a glimpse at the characters of the two leaders.Reagan himself, though, remains something of a cipher. What you see in these videos, many of them recorded as part of a novel administration initiative called “White House TV,” is mostly what you might remember or expect. The president seems like an affable, charming man, at once comfortable in his own skin and oddly detached from his surroundings, with a ready supply of quips, quotations and anecdotes to defuse whatever tension or discomfort might be hovering in the air. If you were predisposed to hate him, you might be surprised to feel a twinge of affection. If you already admired him, you may want a more robust hagiography.But, in any case, you will have to go elsewhere to assess the consequences of his style of leadership, and of the movement he helped bring to power. There are many fine books, of course, and a brilliant essay by Joan Didion. The rhetorical questions posed by earnest talking heads of the era have been rendered moot by history, but Reagan’s legacy remains a live and contentious issue. His name is still routinely invoked, on the left and the right, with reverence and rage. “The Reagan Show” helps attach a face to the name, but it doesn’t accomplish much more than that."

Sure enough, a ruthless operative (Wallace Huo) from a competing company is on the loose, willing to do anything to get the data Xia Tian and her colleagues are working on.Because the process has not been completely successful, Xia Tian’s lab has prohibited human subjects from entering the portal. But she takes the chance and bursts through when her little son’s life is at stake to fight her competitor.To say that this tense sci-fi thriller, directed by Chang (born Yoon Hong-seung) and produced by Jackie Chan, has a strong female lead is an understatement. Thanks to the portal, we are treated to three simultaneous manifestations of Xia Tian, which is about one more than we can easily keep track of when they are engaged in a gun battle.There is shooting and stabbing galore, a clever kidnapping-by-truck routine and breathtaking car chases, as well as a harrowing scene of our heroine sliding down a long conveyor belt that feeds a bubbling caldron of waste.Over all, this is an exciting film if not a completely cohesive one, but Xia Tian’s ultimate decision about her career is a disappointment. One more thing: Think twice about using retinal biometrics for identification. (You’ll see)."

Throughout “Look & See,” Mr. Berry is an almost spectral presence, heard in narration and seen in archival footage. Mr. Berry has been compared to Henry David Thoreau. A longtime resident of Port Royal, Ky., he writes about the environment and the lifestyle of farmers with a naturalist’s curiosity and a poet’s gift for description.Mr. Berry decries the industrialization of agriculture, which he believes will lead us to forget the values that come from living off the land. Mr. Berry’s advocacy has made him a hero for the organic-food movement. (He can count Mark Bittman, a former food columnist for The New York Times, among his fans.) The film introduces farmers sympathetic to his ideals, even if some have strayed.Not all the gambits and arguments are convincing. Using time-lapse photography to illustrate poetry seems overly literal. Dismissing “people’s acceptance of the money economy as the only economy,” Mr. Berry says “the world, in fact, unless you’re in prison, is full of free things that are delightful.” He cites dandelions, but flowers are free only until someone finds a way to sell them. Still, it’s a pleasure to spend 80 minutes in Mr. Berry’s company."

But either way, it’s lovely to watch.This biopic, subtitled “The Courage of Knowledge,” highlights about six years in the life of the great scientist of the title (played by Karolina Gruszka). It starts in 1905 when she and her husband, Pierre (Charles Berling), go to Stockholm to give their Nobel Prize lecture, then moves through his death and toward Marie winning her second Nobel. Those years were eventful, and Ms. Gruszka seems to be in constant, breathless motion, even when only maneuvering around a laboratory.Such continuous activity, and an overcommitment by the film’s director, Marie Noëlle, to stage nearly every frame in what seems to be the utmost flattering angle and pose, sometimes distracts, making it tough to delve into the character’s beautiful mind as she’s either traveling to meet Einstein (Piotr Glowacki) on the beach, having a scandalous affair with the mathematician Paul Langevin (Arieh Worthalter) or trying to overcome the sexism that’s palpably infuriating for being so ever-present.Still, if we don’t always know what drives Curie, we see the determination itself. That’s enough to keep the film moving along. Just as smartly, Ms. Noëlle, who wrote the script with Andrea Stoll, highlights Curie’s success as a result of hard work and personal struggle rather than simple, and stereotypical, “eureka!” moments. There’s a lot of labor and conflict shown here, and rarely have they looked so good."

It tells the story of Ishmael Muslim Ali, who in 1973, when he was called Ishmael LaBeet, was convicted along with four other men of murdering eight people in a shooting at the Fountain Valley Golf Course in St. Croix, V.I., in 1972. Whether the crime was a botched robbery or an episode of racially motivated violence is the subject of debate. (Seven of the eight victims were white and all five suspects were black.)Incredibly, that’s only the beginning of Mr. Ali’s story: On New Year’s Eve in 1984, as he was being transferred from a court in the Virgin Islands back to prison on an American Airlines flight, he hijacked the plane and redirected it to Cuba, where he has lived ever since. (It is not clear how long he will remain, given the changing United States relationship with Havana.)The film, directed by Jamie Kastner, comes billed as having the first interview Mr. Ali has given since that escape. He turns out to be a charismatic and contradictory camera subject. He recounts his experiences in Vietnam, from which he received a dishonorable discharge, and his involvement with the Black Panthers. While admitting he’s no angel, he says he was railroaded in the Fountain Valley case. (Mr. Kastner offers some support for the defense’s argument that the convicts’ confessions resulted from torture.)Notwithstanding Mr. Ali’s account, the most surreal interviews come from the passengers and crew of the flight, who today seem oddly admiring of their hijacker. “The Skyjacker’s Tale” could stand to lose its gimmicky re-enactments. Why supplement a story this crazy?"

Still, it would not be entirely unfair to note that his best-known films of this century are portraits of major historical figures — specifically, two United States secretaries of defense. “The Fog of War,” in 2003, featured the ruminations of Robert S. McNamara, who oversaw a large part of the Vietnam War, while “The Unknown Known,” in 2013, examined Donald H. Rumsfeld and his part in the war in Iraq.“The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman’s Portrait Photography,” Mr. Morris’s new film, is a feature of modest length on a subject of seemingly modest import, particularly relative to those other movies. It begins with Ms. Dorfman herself, puttering among her files of photographs (and the documentary stays with her in this room for about 75 percent of its running time); she speaks at first of a large portrait of her husband, and the fluorescent vest she has sewn on his overcoat (he’s wearing it in the picture) to keep him visible when he walks through streets at night while running errands. If you didn’t know anything about Ms. Dorfman, who’s 80, you might initially take her for a nice old lady with an unusual hobby — someone akin to the American eccentrics Mr. Morris portrayed in his early features, such as “Vernon, Florida” and “Gates of Heaven.”But you would be wrong, and this is part of the point that Mr. Morris makes, quietly, with this enjoyable but also profound movie. Part of Mr. Morris’s reputation as a great documentary filmmaker is derived from his friendly-seeming but pressing interview technique, but here, when he’s heard, he speaks to Ms. Dorfman as a friend, and she responds to him with warm reminiscences of her beginnings as a photographer.She speaks of living in New York City in the late ’50s as a single woman, and of working as a secretary at the publisher Grove Press, where she met the poet Allen Ginsberg, a lifelong friend. She relocated to Cambridge, Mass., and worked at Grolier Poetry Bookshop, all the while snapping pictures of the luminaries she met there and, perhaps more crucially, of herself and her home life. In 1974 she published “Elsa’s Housebook — A Woman’s Photojournal,” a milestone in both American photography and feminist art.Eventually, a combination of luck and persistence led to her setting up a portrait studio equipped with a Polaroid camera that produced 20-inch-by-24-inch prints. Because of the nature of the instantly developing film, Ms. Dorfman would take only two shots of her customers, and allow them to choose which one they wanted to leave with. She kept the other — hence the movie’s title.Mr. Morris made this portrait in the aftermath of Polaroid’s discontinuation of its large-format film and Ms. Dorfman’s subsequent retirement. “Elsa, do you think the camera tells the truth?” he asks. “Absolutely not,” she says with a laugh. Later, though, as she pauses in her descriptions of the pictures she pulls from her files, she speaks of “how many people are dead, and how many people struggled,” and you can feel how her work has revealed some truths about that.Ms. Dorfman emerges as an artist of deep compassion, empathy, humor and wisdom. During a montage of photographs of Ginsberg, he is heard in a late-’50s audio recording reading his great poem “America.” Lines like “America when will you end the human war” and “America why are your libraries full of tears” resonate with a particular poignancy even today, as does “America when will you be angelic.” “The B-Side” is a portrait of a genuine American angel."

And for a while, it’s even quite gripping as we watch Elser painstakingly plant his intricate device in a vast beer hall in Munich where Hitler is to speak.As directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, however, Elser’s capture and lengthy questioning by the Gestapo is a wasted opportunity to illuminate the mind of a man whom historical accounts variously describe as apolitical yet deeply concerned with workers’ rights. Bucolic flashbacks to lakeside picnics, where ripe young women vie for Elser’s floppy-haired attentions and accordion serenades, reveal little about his beliefs or ambitions. Neither does his awkward incursion into the dismal marriage of his lover (Katharina Schüttler) and her sozzled husband.As it happens, the movie’s most compelling interaction is between Elser and a cautious police chief played by the admirable Burghart Klaussner, who achieves more with pursed lips and lowered eyelids than most actors manage with a page of dialogue. It’s a performance that leaves space for nuanced interpretation — something that the rest of this overly conventional picture sorely lacks.With a little more shading and originality, “13 Minutes” might have pushed beyond its familiar Nazi tropes to shape something more immediate and infinitely more potent: an ominous portrait of radicalization."

Boccaccio might have had medieval audiences rolling in the aisles, but Mr. Baena squanders an R rating and a roster of household names while managing to raise little more than a smile.At times, the atmosphere is so clubby that the actors seem to be performing mainly for one another. Centering on three irreverent nuns played by Aubrey Plaza (witchy and bitchy), Alison Brie (frustrated and snooty) and Kate Micucci (bi-curious and babyish), the goofy plot never finds its groove. Molly Shannon, in the role of senior sister, is virtually ignored; and Dave Franco’s hunky handyman is mostly just a ripped body for female characters to enthusiastically molest.Lushly shot in northwest Tuscany by the cinematographer Quyen Tran, “The Little Hours” is saved from ignominy by two brief standout performances. Fred Armisen’s monologue as a scandalized bishop is priceless; but it’s the fabulous Lauren Weedman (who injected warmth and pathos into the thankless role of a gay man’s best friend on the regrettably short-lived HBO show “Looking”) who rises above her one-note character. As a lust-filled lady whose lord leaves her cold, Ms. Weedman sucks every syllable dry. It’s too bad she doesn’t have more of them."

However, tossing these ingredients together does not guarantee a decent scare.Still grieving the murder of her baby sister by her mother, Madison (Katrina Law) returns to her abandoned family home with her cousin (Tara Holt) and fiancé (Bryce Johnson) before the building is demolished. None of them know that the evil spirit that had possessed Madison’s mother would remain, setting the stage for deadly consequences.Mr. Reading and the screenwriter, Vikram Weet, channel the likes of the original “Evil Dead” and “The Amityville Horror” in this story, but there are almost too many references to other movies for this one to become its own monster.Although the script is stuffed with eerie objects and happenings, there is a sense of restraint that keeps “Darkness Rising” from becoming frightening. The cinematography seems static and distant, not so much trapped in a house of evil spirits as it is stifled by the space.The devil is missing from the details, like the lack of dust and cobwebs in the dilapidated house or of bloody footprints after the mother walks on a wounded foot. Even when characters endure increasingly cruel scenarios, the movie feels deadly stiff."

Dru, who lives in a seemingly Mediterranean paradise called Freedonia (you heard that right, but the Marx Brothers references end there), is obscenely wealthy and has an indefinable blondish hairdo apparently trendy among the obscenely wealthy.Gru and Dru bicker but find common cause when Bratt — a petulant, mulleted former 1980s TV child star — leads a giant robot of himself and an army of malevolent flying action figures on an invasion of Hollywood. Of course, the short, goggled and sometimes cyclopean minions are on hand, engaging in a prison food fight and dancing in a cancan-like production number. Innocuous pandemonium ensues in candy colors.The females receive short shrift. Gru and Dru’s mother (Julie Andrews) is a randy yet remote matriarch; Margo is a scold; Agnes lives to find a unicorn; and the formerly single Lucy finds fulfillment when she exults, “I’m a mom, I’m a mom!” The daughters, yes, are rescued from jeopardy.

As big as a medium-sized elephant, with a snout that looks more canine than porcine, she is slobbery and sometimes flatulent, but also loyal, gentle and brave. Okja is devoted, above all, to a girl named Mija. They have grown up together on a remote mountain farm that belongs to Mija’s grandfather, inseparable companions in a classic literary and cinematic tradition.But anyone familiar with that tradition — I’ll mention “Old Yeller” and leave it at that — knows that stories of children and their pets are almost inevitably shadowed by tragedy and loss. The adult human world regards animals through a callous, utilitarian lens, as sources of food, labor or ornamental cuteness, a fact that “Okja,” Bong Joon-ho’s wonderful new film, takes to a dystopian but also an unnervingly realistic extreme.The bond between Okja and Mija, who is an orphan, is the result of a contract neither one of them has read or signed. The pig is the physical and intellectual property of a multinational corporation, and as such she’s destined not only for the usual slaughter but also for crass and cynical commercial exploitation. The girl, a serious and stubborn child (played with heroic dignity by An Seo Hyun), is fated to lose her only friend.Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | NetflixCreditCreditVideo by NetflixThe audience already suspects as much. The first face we see belongs not to a cute computer-generated piglet but to Tilda Swinton, in braces and a blinding platinum bob. Her character, Lucy Mirando — chief executive of the Mirando Corporation, which she inherited from her father — steps in front of the camera to preside over the brightly greenwashed presentation of a diabolical initiative. A new superbreed of swine has been created, she says, and 26 shoats will be distributed to farmers around the world to be raised in sustainable, free-range conditions. After 10 years, they will participate in a kind of livestock beauty pageant, overseen by a popular television veterinarian played by an antic and abrasive Jake Gyllenhaal.ImageTilda Swinton as a chief executive in the food industrial complex in the film.CreditKimberly French/NetflixThe vet’s arrival on Mija’s granddad’s farm, accompanied by Mirando suits and flacks (notably Yoon Jae moon and Shirley Henderson), signals the end of the film’s pastoral interlude, a forest romp as lyrical and magical as anything by the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Mr. Bong has an eye for natural beauty, and also a kinetic and rigorous sense of motion. Once it leaves the countryside, “Okja” turns into a swift urban caper, full of chases and other action-movie set pieces. Mija sets out to liberate her beloved pig, and is joined (and also partly thwarted) by members of the Animal Liberation Front, an earnest, not-always-competent militant group led by Paul Dano.The pursuit of Okja jumps from Seoul to New York, and ends up at a nightmarish meat-processing plant in New Jersey. Mr. Bong, one of the great visual storytellers working in movies today — earlier films like “The Host” and “Snowpiercer” have shown him to be an artist of Spielbergian exuberance and skill — never muddies the frame with extraneous stuff or slows the narrative with tedious exposition. The picture, which never stops moving, is dense with information and feeling. Barbs of satire pop up and are washed away on streams of strong emotion. It’s all marvelously preposterous and yet, at the same time, something important is at stake.A conventional name for that something would be humanity, since “Okja,” not unlike “E. T.,” is about how a young person achieves moral insight by connecting with and fighting for a nonhuman creature. Okja’s oppressors, like E. T.’s, are part of a system that refuses to recognize her as anything more than a thing. In this case, that system is specifically the food industrial complex, and her tale is a clear and effective animal rights fable, or at least a protest against factory farming and genetic engineering. (Nobody advocates for the fish and chickens Mija and her grandfather eat at home.)This might make the movie sound heavier and more dogmatic than it actually is. But if you have seen “Snowpiercer,” a parable of global inequality set aboard a high-speed train, you know that Mr. Bong juggles delight and didacticism with exquisite grace. Rather than turn out cardboard heroes and villains, he savors the eccentricity of his characters, in the sheer weirdness of our ingenious and idiotic species. He is fascinated by the petty doctrinal arguments and personal rivalries in the ranks of the Animal Liberation Front and also by the boardroom intrigue within the Mirando Corporation. Keep your eye on Giancarlo Esposito, and your ear out for Lucy Mirando’s sister, Nancy.The human performers are all brilliant, but the movie belongs to its title character and her digitally conjured, genetically modified ilk. Okja is a miracle of imagination and technique, and “Okja” insists, with abundant mischief and absolute sincerity, that she possesses a soul."

He’s never been one of those filmmakers who expect you to be blinded by the bright sheen of his résumé, which includes comical genre rethinks like the zombie flick “Shaun of the Dead” and the cop caper “Hot Fuzz.” Mr. Wright works for your love, hard enough that you notice the whirring machinery if perhaps not the strain. He wants it easy and breezy, although mostly he wants it cool, whether the latest means to his end, Baby (Ansel Elgort), is smooth-moving like Gene Kelly or burning rubber like Steve McQueen.A genre ride with a rebuilt engine and a sweet paint job, “Baby Driver” is all about movement and sometimes stillness and how a beautiful man looks (feels, seems, is) even better when he’s in glorious, syncopated, restless motion. The first time you see Baby — that’s his handle, which suits Mr. Elgort, with his angelic face and young man’s lissomeness — he’s in the driver’s seat, where he belongs. The car doesn’t look like much, just a cherry-red box with doors and a spoiler. Like us, Baby is waiting for the action to start, seemingly sealed off from the outside world with his dark sunglasses and earbuds.This is how Baby rolls, with shifting gears, pumping feet and thumping tunes, and how Mr. Wright rolls here as well. There’s a story, sure, about Baby getting in and out of trouble while finding love and money. He doesn’t have much of an inner life, but he has skills, a heavy back story and a kindly foster father, Joe (CJ Jones, who helps give the movie its faint heartbeat), a deaf invalid with whom he signs. Baby also has tinnitus, which he quells with music; mostly, he has killer timing and gracefully elastic, reactive physicality that suggests Mr. Wright has put in time with the films of Jacques Tati.ImageFrom left, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx in a film crammed with cubistic action, glowering and golly-gee types and an encyclopedia of cinematic allusion.CreditWilson Webb/TriStar PicturesThat’s wonderful company to keep and to learn from, especially when you’re as cleverly attentive a student as Mr. Wright. Baby drives hard, fast, tight and seemingly oh so effortlessly, spinning wheels across pavement like a Russian Olympian on ice. In the eye-tickling opener — a wham, bam, we’ll-take-the-cash-ma’am heist — Baby peels out in that red box (a souped-up Subaru) and motors into one of those warped Road Runner chases that builds momentum with near escapes, not-even-close winking and the twangy throbbing of “Bellbottoms,” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a group once unforgettably described by the critic Robert Christgau as “avant-travestying da blooze.”“Baby Driver” isn’t avant-travestying; it’s a pop pastiche par excellence, crammed with cubistic action; glowering and golly-gee types (played by the seductive likes of Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Eiza González and Lily James); and an encyclopedia of cinematic allusions, all basted in wall-to-wall tuneage. At times, the whole thing spins like a tribute album, a collection of covers of varying quality: diner yaks à la Quentin Tarantino, Godardian splashes of color. When it works, the allusions give you a contact high, like when a friend turns you on to a favorite movie. At other times, Mr. Wright’s pleasure veers into the self-satisfied, and all that love feels smothering, near-bullying, like bro-cinephilia in extremis.In the main, it’s easy to go with Mr. Wright’s flow, partly because he rarely steps off the gas. It’s just go go go with an occasional stop for coffee or an amusingly testy sit-down with Baby’s shadowy boss, Doc, one of those all-seeing, all-knowing criminal mystics whom Kevin Spacey gives ominous ooze and a daddy’s mad (maybe nuts) indoor voice. Doc has something on Baby, who’s been forced into a life of bad behavior and company. That Baby has had no choice but to drive along plays as knowingly implausible as it sounds. But heroic fatalism and unwilling villainy remain enduring cinematic tropes, including in gangster movies, even if it means holding convention over complexity.There’s much to enjoy in “Baby Driver,” including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted. The edits snap, the colors pop and the cinematography serves the performances and the story rather than embalming them in an emptily showy, self-regarding directorial conceit. The emotions are mostly rote and cold, but the car chases are hot — at once fluid, geometric and rhythmic, with a beat Baby carries with him out of the car whether he’s on the stroll or the run. (The director of photography is Bill Pope; the editors are Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos; and the stunt coordinator is Darrin Prescott, leading an army.)“Baby Driver” is so good that you want it to be better and go deeper, for it to put down its guns (or at least hold them differently) and transcend its clichés and cine-quotes so it can rocket out of the genre safe box into the cosmic beyond where craft and technique transform into art. That’s admittedly somewhat of a greedy complaint, particularly given how much Mr. Wright does right and that he clearly wants you levitating out of your seat. It’s difficult to carp about a director who wants to please the audience this much (instead of, say, the franchise suits). At the same time, you have to wonder where Mr. Wright might go if he cut loose from his influences and let a little feeling muss up his form."

Then again, maybe the elephant, called Pop Aye and played by a majestic giant named Bong, is just exhausted, namely with people. You can’t blame him. He’s been tramping around the countryside for much of the movie, usually in the fumbling company of Thana (Thaneth Warakulnukroh), an architect from Bangkok who, with his marriage on the rocks and his career seriously on the skids, has set off on his midlife crisis not behind the wheel of a new sports car but alongside an old elephant.They make a funny pair, by turns amusing and puzzling, though also melancholic and touching. For the most part, these variations seem by design in a movie that flirts with assorted narrative conventions and fluctuating moods without ever settling into a familiar template. It takes some time, though, to figure out what the writer-director Kirsten Tan has in store for Thana and Pop Aye, who are first seen trudging together along a dusty, bleak stretch of road. They’re nowhere in particular, certainly nowhere remotely inviting, and before long they’re trying to catch a ride, which is about as challenging as you might expect when one of the hitchhikers is an elephant.Thana, it emerges, is on his way to his childhood home. His reasons emerge piecemeal, relayed in regular flashbacks that create a mosaic-like portrait of a man whose life somehow, somewhere went wrong. Not catastrophically wrong, mind you, just disappointingly adrift and askew. That seems to be the idea, although it takes an attentive, patient viewer to fit together the shards that Ms. Tan scatters throughout, and to see how the flashbacks to Thana’s childhood, with its pleasures and dark secrets, fit in with his more recent slights and grievances, including the impending demolition of one of his buildings, a glass-tower monument to consumerism.This narrative fragmentation can be needlessly frustrating rather than interestingly complex and, like some of Ms. Tan’s other choices, register as more programmatic than organic. At times, the long shots create meaning, giving you information and giving you room and time to breathe, to look around and appreciate the very large animal dwarfing a man who seems to have shrunk inside himself; at other times, the long shots feel close to art-film mannerisms. Ms. Tan is on far stronger, truer ground when she moves away from Thana’s home life with his wife, Bo (Penpak Sirikul in a thankless, shrewish role), and leaves behind psychological explanation and matrimonial strife.Like all road movies, “Pop Aye” also journeys into the interior lives of its characters, a trip that is aided and abetted by other travelers who briefly hop on and off: notably, a poetic squatter; a pair of bumbling cops, who bust Thana and Pop Aye for eating thrown-away melon; and a transgender woman who, with grit and dignity, is holding onto a marginal existence. Each adds another detail, a splash of color and real warmth, though I wish there was more about Pop Aye, more attention, more close-ups. He’s beautiful and heartbreaking, both because of what he adds to the story but also for all the extracinematic meaning he can’t help but bring, all the pain, all the tears."

But “In Transit,” the last film from the great documentarian Albert Maysles (“Salesman,” “Grey Gardens”), a founding figure of the direct cinema movement, suggests that we’ve lost something in an era of easy flying and road trips.“In Transit” depicts cross-country train travel as a rare refuge of American idealism — the quintessence of the go-west spirit, even for passengers heading east. At 76 minutes, the movie may seem modest, but there are shades of Jack Kerouac and Studs Terkel in its chronicler’s ambitions, and echoes of John Ford in its portrayal of how Americans form communities.Working with a team of co-directors — Lynn True, Nelson Walker, Ben Wu and David Usui — Mr. Maysles, who died at 88 a month before this movie’s premiere at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival, shot three round trips on Amtrak’s Empire Builder route, which connects Chicago with Portland, Ore., and Seattle. (It splits into two segments west of Spokane, Wash.)ImageA scene from “In Transit,” which documents cross-country rail trips.CreditSubmarine DeluxeSome passengers have settled in for the long haul. Others, like the woman returning to Montana to reconcile with her family, or the expectant mother eager to reach Minnesota before she goes into labor — a prospect that alarms several conductors — are on board for only part of the way.Yet “In Transit” illustrates how their journeys mirror one another, and not just geographically. A 21-year-old heads to North Dakota, convinced that seven years of oil-boom work will earn him money for life. Another man, having already toiled there, heads in the opposite direction, to Indiana and the woman he loves, to settle down, something he thought he’d never do. He worries about finding a job there.Other passengers seek to forget romance or to clear their heads. The mix is roughly even between those settling unfinished business and those, like the young man from Mississippi who left his job overnight, who have hopped aboard on impulse.“In Transit” has been edited — by Ms. True — to privilege narrative over chronology. At any moment, the movie is liable to turn up at a different spot along the route, a sort of productive disorientation that contributes to a feeling of universality. Anyone who thinks the movie was easy to make should try getting watchable footage out of a train window. (A separate drive-along trip was necessary for the picturesque exterior shots.)While observing roughhousing children, dining car meals, card games and a jam session, the movie makes room for perceptive observations on class, race and upbringing. At times, “In Transit” seems utopian in its optimism that all it takes to get two people talking is to put them in adjacent seats. Here’s a summer movie that is about — and offers — escape."
"9779","My Journey Through French Cinema","",1,"MANOHLA DARGIS","Review: Those Movies, Himself — Bertrand Tavernier’s Tour of French Cinema","In “My Journey Through French Cinema,” Mr. Tavernier’s documentary about movies doubles as an autobiography.","2017-06-22",NA,"2017-11-02 04:16:45",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/movies/my-journey-through-french-cinema-review-bertrand-tavernier.html,Read the New York Times Review of My Journey Through French Cinema,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/23/arts/23MYJOURNEY/23MYJOURNEY-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Bertrand Tavernier’s “My Journey Through French Cinema” delivers what it promises. Even so, its explanatory title doesn’t begin to convey just how exhilarating or inspiring a documentary this truly is, and how excellent a trip this well-respected French director takes you on. Deep, thoughtful, immersive, specific yet also wide-reaching, it is an exploration of French cinema by one of its own, a cinephile whose formative movie love evolved into a directing career that includes titles like “Coup de Torchon,” “Life and Nothing But” and “Captain Conan.”It begins once upon a time in Lyon, France, where Mr. Tavernier was born in 1941. He was born again, in a sense, when he saw “Dernier Atout.” “That’s where a movie made its first real impact on me,” he says over gleaming black-and-white images from a chase scene with fedored gangsters, motorcycle cops and lots of atmosphere. Mr. Tavernier could visualize that chase for years but it wasn’t until a quarter-century later that — voilà! — he identified it as coming from a 1942 crime film directed by Jacques Becker. “At age 6,” Mr. Tavernier says with a smile, “I could’ve made a worse choice.”Mr. Tavernier’s acknowledgment of his own precocity is amusingly self-aware and inviting; it quickly humanizes the documentary and suggests that, while Mr. Tavernier speaks with authority, this is also a highly personal enterprise. It is, after all, his journey, one that has its own routes, ports of call and charming idiosyncrasies. And while the movie more or less flows chronologically — he is born, he sees films, becomes a man, sees more movies, becomes a director — it isn’t slavishly linear. Mr. Tavernier also likes to circle back to earlier periods, including ones he’s passed over or through, returns that make for surprises and that reflect a profound, insistent sense of history.In “My Journey Through French Cinema,” history is a thread that Mr. Tavernier uses to pull together different movies and makers, creating arguments — about art and life, time and space — that become autobiography. When Mr. Tavernier announces that Becker was “one of the French directors who best understood and mastered American filmmaking,” you hear admiration in his voice. And when he adds that Becker’s passion for American cinema is evident in all his movies and lingers on that director’s love of jazz, you may also flash on Mr. Tavernier’s own jazz movie, “’Round Midnight.” (Mr. Tavernier also helped write an encyclopedic book titled “50 Years of American Cinema.”)Although he pops up onscreen, Mr. Tavernier mostly guides you with his voice, which tethers you to his essayistic discussions. The movie is divided into sections that are punctuated by a fade to black and are, largely if not exclusively, centered on directors. Some are fairly straightforward; at other times, Mr. Tavernier pleasurably meanders as when, after a mention of boarding school, he moves onto topics like François Truffaut and “Shoot the Piano Player” (“It’s the only film I saw booed on the Champs-Élysées”); Henri Langlois, a founder of the Cinémathèque Française; André Malraux’s “L’Espoir”; other critics (“we wanted to decide for ourselves”); and the director Edmond T. Gréville.Mr. Tavernier’s descriptions oscillate between the precise and the sweeping, and every so often he floats on private currents of thought. Usually, you see what he says — words fit the images — but not always. I loved the sound of “the mise-en-scène flexes emotion like you flex your muscles,” for instance, but didn’t truly know what that was supposed to mean. He drops this line while discussing Becker’s “Casque d’Or” over a scene in which a man (Serge Reggiani) looks yearningly at a dancing woman (Simone Signoret). Still, if you keep watching and listening (always a good idea), you too see the emotions — perhaps not flexing, but rippling — as she whirls, eyes fixed on the man not in her arms.Mr. Tavernier turned movie love into criticism but, like all good critics, he never fell out of love. It’s delightful to share in that passion and a pleasure too that he’s more interested in ideas and emotions than stories and plots. If you don’t know the films he talks about, you may not grasp what they’re about; it doesn’t matter. He also doesn’t identify everyone onscreen, mostly, I think, because he really wants you to watch and listen and, anyway, you can read their names in the credits. I suggest you sit through them with paper and pen so you can write down the title of every movie you’ve already seen (you’ll want to watch them again) and every title you’ve never heard of (because worlds await)."

And when he’s handed a small video camera by his director and asked to film his life, the resulting diary of perseverance and suffering has a raw immediacy that’s both appropriate and involving.ImageNori Sharif, a nurse in Iraq, in a scene from the documentary.CreditEast Village EntertainmentThe look is rough, the emotions always hovering near the surface. Yet, buoyed by Mr. Sharif’s cheery personality, these can sometimes be defiantly upbeat.“Have you been injured before?” he asks a patient, who answers no. “Then you are not from Iraq,” he says, smiling. Moments like this are few, though, as he documents the rising tide of danger and displacement that follows the 2011 withdrawal of coalition forces and the eventual arrival of the Islamic State. Throughout, his director (who was born and raised in Iraq and has been observing families in the region for years) maintains a determinedly hands-off approach. This allows Mr. Sharif’s bewilderment over what he calls “an undiagnosed war” to become the story, one that speaks specifically to the profoundly destabilizing nature of lengthy conflict.It also permits us to honor those whose spirits appear indestructible.“Everything is expensive in this country,” goes a lively song that plays at a wedding, “but sadness you can get for free.” And the men dance."

That’s one of the truisms in “The Big Sick,” a joyous, generous-hearted romantic comedy that, even as it veers into difficult terrain, insists that we just need to keep on laughing. Outwardly, the story seems familiar: A really nice guy falls for a woman he may not be worthy of and nearly blows it. What gives the movie both fizz and sting — and shows that there’s plenty of juice and possibility left in the American romantic comedy — are its particulars, especially the comic Kumail Nanjiani, who plays a fictionalized version of himself, a Pakistani-American struggling to make it in stand-up while fumbling through the rest of his life.Mr. Nanjiani (who shares his name with his character) plays a 30-ish guy navigating these two seemingly irreconcilable worlds and identities. A fledgling Chicago stand-up, Kumail is a regular at a club where, alongside his comrades — played by the real-life funny people Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler — he routinely tries to make a roomful of people laugh. One evening, he teasingly mixes it up with a customer, Emily (a wonderful Zoe Kazan), a jittery charmer with a mile-wide smile whom he soon makes moves on. Flirtation leads to one and then another night together, and before long, they’re frolicking in one of those time-is-passing montages.The real Emily is Emily V. Gordon, who’s married to Mr. Nanjiani. They wrote “The Big Sick” together — it was directed by Michael Showalter — creating comedy and drama from their lives. The story tracks the giddy start of their relationship, with its dazed smiles and intimacy, a romance that seems to collapse when she discovers that he hasn’t told his family about her. Kumail’s parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff, both great), who live within dining distance, are trying to find him a wife and have been parading appealing prospects before him. He wants to please his folks, but he’s falling for Emily. He can’t decide what to do, so she breaks it off, but then falls gravely ill.The movie’s title is a giveaway: Emily’s sickness is big, as well as terrifying and confounding, and it lands her in an intensive care unit, hooked to life support. Before long, she is in an induced coma; Kumail’s doe eyes are watering; and you’re wondering, wait, isn’t this supposed to be a comedy? It is, and through sickness and nearly death, it remains a very funny one, too, producing a wide range of laughs, from staccato titters to abrupt guffaws and huge, body-shaking bursts. The ratio of jokes to screen time is satisfyingly high, and there are few stretches that aren’t enlivened by humor that, joke by joke, with silliness and caustic asides, also deepens the movie.ImageHolly Hunter and Ray Romano as parents in “The Big Sick,” directed by Michael Showalter.CreditNicole Rivelli/Amazon Studios, LionsgateIn his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani tells longish, confessional tales about, say, his attempts to be cool in school or watching a pornographic videotape in his parents’ home in Pakistan when the power went out. He can’t get the tape out of the VCR, so he decides he has to “pack my bags and walk the earth, which sucks because I love my parents and I’m 12 years old.” Taken out of context, of course, any given sentence in this kind of circuitous, long-form amble doesn’t sound especially funny. But Mr. Nanjiani builds the bit artfully, aided by a stealthy persona that comes across as perfectly ordinary until he deploys a puckish smile, revs up his adenoidal whine and gets his heavy eyebrows dancing.As he does in his stand-up, Mr. Nanjiani, who immigrated to the United States when he was a teenager, mines the comedy of cultural difference in “The Big Sick” with a light, sharp touch. In another, earlier bit, he talks about a roller-coaster ride, which he calls the scariest experience of his life, adding, “and I grew up in Pakistan.” In the movie, he drops a few terrorist-themed jokes so lightly that you’re caught off guard as much by his casual delivery as by the actual gags. You sense that he’s probably heard every ugly joke about Muslims imaginable, and so he’s learned how to get there first, staking a claim on a contested subject, finding humor and strength in other people’s stupidity.In some ways, “The Big Sick” plays like an extended version of one of Mr. Nanjiani’s anecdotal tales, though one streaked in tears and featuring a cast that includes the perfectly paired Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as Emily’s parents. Mr. Showalter, whose movies include “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” isn’t much of a visual stylist — the look of this movie is basically functional plus — but he’s terrific with actors and understands that even minor characters should be people, not background. In “The Big Sick,” you vividly see the person in each role, from nurse (Myra Lucretia Taylor) to would-be bride (Kuhoo Verma), which enriches the emotional texture and underlines that there’s something at stake.Ms. Kazan’s work here is pivotal, especially given that she needs to make a lasting, expressive impact with Emily before the character disappears, and the narrative center of gravity shifts squarely to Kumail. In other words, you need to fall for Emily as much as Kumail does while she pokes and prods him, encouraging him to come out and play. When he’s offstage, Kumail can seem as if he were waiting for something to happen, and when her parents arrive in Chicago, he recedes, turtle-like, creating a recessiveness that makes some of his deadpan discomfort even squirmier. Mostly, Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Kazan look and sound — and, importantly, feel — like people, like people you know and might fall for.I fell hard for both Ms. Kazan and Mr. Nanjiani and “The Big Sick,” which tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze. Comedy is said to be hard; mostly, I think, by comics. Romantic comedy is apparently even tougher, at least from recent onscreen evidence. Few filmmakers know how to fit contemporary men and women, straight or gay, into narrative forms that were developed once upon a time. In “The Big Sick,” Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon vault over that hurdle with openness and delight, revitalizing an often moribund subgenre with a true story of love, death and the everyday comedy of being a 21st-century American."

SCOTT","Review: Cannibalism, Hallucinogens and Keanu: ‘The Bad Batch’ Has It All","An updated tale of ostracism for the golden age of dystopia, written and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour.","2017-06-22","2017-06-23","2017-11-02 04:18:27",article,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/movies/the-bad-batch-review-keanu-reeves.html,Read the New York Times Review of The Bad Batch,mediumThreeByTwo210,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/23/arts/23BADBATCH/23BADBATCH-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg,210,140,"Future historians — assuming that any such creatures exist — will surely identify the present moment as a golden age of dystopia. They may argue about whether our ever-proliferating political, ecological, technological and zombie-infested nightmares offer caution or consolation. Think about how bad things could get! But then again: Look how much worse they could be. Reality, meanwhile, inspires these dire visions and competes with them for sheer relentless awfulness.All of which is to say that “The Bad Batch,” a messy, sunbaked pop-culture cobbler written and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour, is both a bummer and a blast. It conjures a bare-bones, moderately plausible near future in which criminals and other undesirables are subjected to a modern variant of the ancient practice of ostracism. After being tattooed behind the ear, members of the Bad Batch are abandoned on the far side of a border fence — we don’t know who paid for it — with a jug of water and a fast-food hamburger.The opening sequence accompanies a young woman named Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) through this process. Her possessions include a couple of pairs of skimpy shorts, some voluntary skin ink and a sullen attitude. She wears the Bad Batch designation as a badge of honor.But Arlen and the audience quickly learn that there are degrees of badness in this universe. The desert castaways have organized themselves into makeshift societies, two of which figure prominently in Arlen’s subsequent adventures. First she encounters an encampment of bodybuilders who practice cannibalism and aggressive tanning amid broken-down trailers and airplane detritus. Arlen is kidnapped, drugged, chained up and invited to dinner, one limb at a time.“Y’all are pure evil” she will say when the time for revenge arrives, and while it’s hard to argue — the knowledge has literally cost her an arm and a leg — nothing is quite as simple as that. One of the people-eaters is a cute little girl named Honey (Jayda Fink) with a nonpredatory fondness for bunnies. She and her dad (Jason Momoa) — a taciturn, muscular dude identified as Miami Man by the letters inked on his chest — become part of Arlen’s initially feckless, increasingly determined existence. They serve as reminders of her own inconvenient humanity.On the other side of an expanse of sandy flats, not too far from where the cannibals congregate, is a place called Comfort. A muttering wanderer (an unrecognizable Jim Carrey) deposits Arlen outside its gates. The residents of this relatively benign zone are kept safe by armed guards and ramparts made of shipping containers and kept happy with hallucinogens and dance music. The D.J. is played by Diego Luna. The patriarch of Comfort — church, state and pharmaceutical industry all at once — is a philosophical fellow with a droopy mustache and a retinue of pregnant concubines. He is played by Keanu Reeves.That fact alone might be reason enough to brace yourself for episodes of shocking violence and spend some time in Ms. Amirpour’s world. Mr. Reeves in middle age is never not interesting, and he invests this role with the perfect alloy of gravity and goofiness. Happily, “The Bad Batch” is much more than a sacrament for devotees of the Higher Keanuism. It is a fluent and knowing pastiche of genres and styles with a brazen and vigorous wit of its own.Ms. Amirpour’s 2014 debut feature, the Persian-language feminist vampire melodrama “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” has already acquired a cult following. Like that film, which had traces of Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch and Aki Kaurismaki in its DNA, “The Bad Batch” is not shy about showing its influences, which appear to include “Mad Max,” “Kill Bill” and the lean, mean ’50s oaters of Budd Boetticher.But Ms. Amirpour’s films are more than a sampling of her DVD collection; her engagement with familiar themes and classic tropes is as critical as it is admiring. “The Bad Batch,” a tale of vengeance, violence, power and redemption built on the ethical foundations of the traditional western, scrambles and satisfies expectations at the same time. Arlen walks a well-trodden path from outlaw self-preservation to righteousness, with interludes of lust, confusion and drug-enhanced stargazing. She veers toward some stereotypes and refutes others, keeping herself and the viewer in a state of perpetual unbalance.“The Bad Batch” traffics in images and situations that evoke what used to be called exploitation movies, reveling in its own (and its heroine’s) anarchic, transgressive energy. As such, it’s good, dirty fun. But it also takes exploitation — of bodies, of feeling, of labor — seriously. You may wonder what the heck you’re looking at, but that’s kind of the point."

Trump, with three overarching points to make.The first is that whatever you think of Gawker’s decision to publish an excerpt from a sex tape featuring Mr. Hogan, a professional wrestler whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, the case had potentially far-ranging implications for the news media’s ability to cover public figures. The $140 million judgment against Gawker, which filed for bankruptcy and was later sold to Univision — the suit was ultimately settled with Mr. Hogan for $31 million — sets a precedent that the movie argues could snuff out significant reporting. (Not all legal experts are so sure.)The second is that the lawsuit itself, subsequently revealed to have been bankrolled by Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder and Silicon Valley billionaire, represented a disturbing instance of a powerful figure secretly using wealth to stifle a voice he regarded as adversarial. The movie suggests that while moguls meddling in the news is at least as old as William Randolph Hearst, hidden puppeteering of this sort is new. About an hour in, the movie clumsily shifts focus, introducing former staff members of The Las Vegas Review-Journal who recount Sheldon Adelson’s secretive acquisition of that paper, a publication that could theoretically serve as a check on Mr. Adelson’s dealings.The third, hardly a surprise, is that the presidency of Mr. Trump, who makes a regular target of reporters, represents a threat to news organizations interested in pursuing the truth.But just because “Nobody Speak” has a timely message doesn’t make it an ideal messenger. Mr. Knappenberger seems to have created this impassioned defense of news organizations for moviegoers who don’t keep up with the news. Almost nothing in “Nobody Speak” breaks new ground. As if afraid of boring anybody, Mr. Knappenberger lays on a percussive synthesizer score so insistent and manipulative that it’s like watching the movie with electrodes attached.The featured interviewees include the parties involved, mostly with the Gawker side (the site’s founder, Nick Denton, and Albert J.

Among the outside experts are the First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who defended The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, and Margaret Sullivan, the Times’s former public editor (now with The Washington Post). They frame the issues in reasonable sound bites, though Ms. Sullivan in particular has addressed the Gawker matter in more depth elsewhere.In that sense, perhaps the hacky presentation is strategic — a way of incentivizing viewers to click off Netflix and read the news instead."

In such cases, he eschews drugs or surgeries. Instead, he counsels patients to consider the connection between their minds and their bodies, and that way decrease their discomfort through psychological understanding.Such ideas, we’re told, have caused Dr. Sarno, now in his 90s, to be shunned by the medical establishment. His theories and books, however, have been championed by the likes of Howard Stern and Larry David, who are interviewed here along with plenty of noncelebrities. Their testimonials come across as well informed and thoughtful.Michael Galinsky, one of the film’s directors (with Suki Hawley and David Beilinson), sought Dr. Sarno’s help for back pain. Recounting his own experiences for the documentary is an intriguing plan. But the scenes he chooses take up too much time — we meet Mr. Galinsky’s cute children and hear of his complicated parents; we attend his brother’s wedding — that could have been used to explore Dr. Sarno’s views further, or to hear from some of the countless doctors who, it’s said, dispute his claims and methods.Nevertheless, “All the Rage” overrides most of its shortcomings by keeping a breezy tone and by showing Dr. Sarno to be a convincing speaker, as well as an affable and somewhat crusty character. While this documentary leaves you wanting to know more about his beliefs, the introduction alone is valuable enough."

Young’s romantic drama “bwoy” is another cautionary tale about meeting strangers online. Stuck in a bleak New York winter after the death of his son, a grieving man, Brad (Anthony Rapp), seeks solace by cruising a gay dating site. He falls into the virtual arms of Yenny (Jimmy Brooks), a charismatic young Jamaican, but their flirty and dirty texts and video calls soon morph into something devastating.Brad is not yet out to his wife (De’Adre Aziza). As the affair progresses, he struggles to control his temper around customers at work and looks pained every time his new love interest calls him “Daddy.” The film sets Brad up for a messy midlife crisis, and Mr. Young’s hand-held camerawork brings little stability to the frame.Mr. Young, who also wrote the script, teases out the story in bits of coy hints and half-truths about a tragic accident, leaving too many questions unanswered. More than once, Brad mentions to others that he’s a doctor but not why he’s no longer practicing. The movie stumbles into the murky waters of colonization and racial politics when Brad, who is white, starts doing research on Jamaica, bringing up the island’s history of slavery in between gorgeous pictures of beaches and photos of hunky black men.Although Mr. Rapp personifies Brad’s repression, Mr. Brooks looks effervescent and playful during their video chats. He hides his intentions with excitable energy and a bright smile, which somehow feel less manipulative than the movie."

G.M.O.s — genetically modified organisms — and the crops they enable have become another field of battle.Directed by Scott Hamilton Kennedy, “Food Evolution” hopes to demystify G.M.O.s and points to successes like Hawaiian papayas and Ugandan bananas, which were saved from devastating viruses. And while it gives opponents their say, the film rebuts their arguments, including reports that suggest G.M.O.s lead to a rise in farmers’ suicide rates and an increase in pesticide use. (The response to the first: correlation is not causation; to the second, yes, but those pesticides are far less toxic.)The film also speaks with food journalists (including Michael Pollan, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine) as well as farmers who have benefited from the technology. And if trust is an issue, Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps the most credible public scientist on the planet, is its narrator.The documentary acknowledges the gorilla in the garden: Monsanto, a leading exponent of modification, is “one of the most-hated companies in the world.” There are many reasons Monsanto raises hackles, Dr. Tyson acknowledges, but “to be concerned about the safety of their G.M.O.s is to be misinformed.”The food industry recruits scientists to speak on its behalf, but in press notes and email correspondence, the film’s producers say no funding came from any Big Ag company or lobbying group. “Food Evolution” was commissioned by the nonprofit Institute of Food Technologists, and the filmmakers retained creative control.With a soft tone, respectful to opponents but insistent on the data, “Food Evolution” posits an inconvenient truth for organic boosters to swallow: In a world desperate for safe, sustainable food, G.M.O.s may well be a force for good."

It’s a severe story, made more so by its powerhouse lead actress.This parable-like tale opens in mid-argument, as the determined title character (Dolores Fonzi) is informing her somewhat cynical father (Oscar Martínez) of her plan to leave her comfortable home in Argentina to teach in a rural village.“You say I’m an amazing lawyer,” she tells him. “What does that matter, if I can’t change anyone’s life?”Upon arriving in the poverty-stricken town she is confronted with unfriendly students and soon, much, much worse: One night she is beaten and raped. She believes that some of her pupils were involved, and the resulting suspicion and tension escalates: Her father arrives, seeking revenge, while Paulina fights to regain her bearings.Santiago Mitre, the director and one of the screenwriters (the film is based on a 1960 movie, “La Patota”), trains his camera on tight shots of Ms. Fonzi then stays out of her way. Though a few conversations mark her mind-set, there is no speechifying or grandstanding. Ms. Fonzi’s presence, arresting and often silent, speaks volumes.It’s frequently tough to decide if Paulina is misguided or admirable. Yet even if you disagree with the character’s choices, you can feel her belief in them, and respect her resolve. Indeed, few satisfying answers arise here. But there’s bravery in asking the questions, and this film knows something about courage."

Partly inspired by George Prochnik’s 2010 book of the same title, this elegant sermon by Patrick Shen on why we should dial down the racket of our daily lives will make you consider turning off and tuning out.Gathering academics, audiologists and other experts who share his anticacophony view, Mr. Shen aims to show that excessive sound can negatively affect our bodies as well as our minds. His style is compare-and-contrast: rural versus urban, the natural world versus the electronic and synthetic. Tranquil scenes from an Iowa monastery and a national park give way jarringly to the metallic din in a subway station and the deafening clamor of a restaurant. A visit to Mumbai (believed to be the noisiest city in the world) will leave your ears ringing.Shot over two years and in eight countries, the movie has a quirky lightness that prevents it from slipping into lecture. Its arguments range wide without going deep, but its factoids about the medical benefits of hanging out in a forest — and the cognitive costs of a noisy school or hospital — are fascinating and persuasive.At times, the film’s insistence on linking the silent to the sacred can border on preachy. But then we check in with Greg Hindy, a stoic searcher who stopped talking for a year while he walked across the United States. As he tromps over the Golden Gate Bridge with his little cart, holding handwritten signs up to the camera, he’s not looking for God — he’s just seeking the space to think."

Mr. Combs, who topped Forbes’s 2017 list of highest-paid celebrities, is a mogul in television, clothing, fragrances and spirits. “Can’t Stop” sticks with the music, focusing on preparations for two Bad Boy reunion concerts in May 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.After glimpsing visitors and performers backstage — including Jay-Z, Faith Evans and Lil’ Kim — we learn of Mr. Combs’s beginnings at Uptown Records, before his ascent with a string of platinum Bad Boy albums. Much time is devoted to Biggie Smalls and his 1997 killing in a drive-by shooting amid the coastal rap rivalry that also claimed Tupac Shakur. (“Puff was Big’s big brother,” Jay-Z says, invoking one of Mr. Combs’s nicknames.) On camera, Clive Davis, Jimmy Iovine, Mary J. Blige and others testify to Mr. Combs’s gifts. (Mr. Combs, of course, produced the film, with Heather Parry.)After rehearsals in Lititz, Pa., the players hit Barclays, where an audio glitch dampens Mr. Combs’s entrance on a riser. On the film’s soundtrack, Nina Simone’s “I Feel Good” accompanies a glossy montage of stage footage, but the artists performing at the concert aren’t heard until the closing credits, and only briefly. What “Can’t Stop” mostly leaves you with is a sense of Mr. Combs’s success."

In the first scenes, a young girl ventures out into the woods to collect mushrooms and finds a strange man under a tree: a Union soldier with a badly wounded leg and a charming Irish brogue. Is he a prince or an ogre? (He’s Colin Farrell, which may or may not clarify the issue.)That is only one of the questions that hover in the humid, crepuscular air. The soldier, Cpl. John McBurney by name, finds himself convalescing in a plantation house, formerly a girls’ boarding school, occupied by his rescuer, Miss Amy (Oona Laurence) and her teachers and classmates. The matriarch of the group — there are six of them in all — is Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), who occupies an intriguing middle ground between fairy godmother and wicked stepmother, a zone that is familiar real estate for Ms. Kidman.VideoSofia Coppola narrates a sequence featuring Colin Farrell and Kirsten Dunst.Published OnJune 28, 2017CreditCreditBen Rothstein/Focus FeaturesIs McBurney a prisoner or a guest? Is he a threat to his hosts or is it the other way around? Who is beguiling whom? Ms. Coppola approaches these matters with her signature mix of intensity and detachment. Decorum is observed — grace is said before meals; corsets are tightened; French verbs are conjugated; everyone is called “miss” — but under the surface all kinds of strong emotions seethe and simmer. Even at midday the place has a gloomy, twilight quality. (The cinematographer is Philippe Le Sourd.) Mist and cannon smoke from a distant battlefield hang amid the Spanish moss. The atmosphere is too genteel to be gothic, but it is haunted nonetheless, by intimations of disorder, lust and violence.“Nous sommes des filles” the girls recite during their lessons, and “The Beguiled,” which remakes and revises Don Siegel’s 1971 film (with Clint Eastwood in Mr. Farrell’s role), is in part an essay on the nuances and paradoxes of femininity. It’s also the portrait of a group of ladies sorted by type and temperament. Miss Amy is sharp-witted and intellectually curious. Miss Jane (Angourie Rice), the princess of the group, is imperious and judgmental. Miss Emily (Emma Howard) is openhearted and obliging. Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning) is sullen and sneaky. Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) applies herself to her duties with an air of disappointment. They find themselves competing for McBurney’s favor as he sets about manipulating their vanities and insecurities, smiling like a tomcat who has stumbled into a cage full of canaries.ImageElle Fanning in “The Beguiled.”CreditBen Rothstein/Focus FeaturesLike many of the characters in Ms. Coppola’s other films, Miss Martha and her charges dwell in a realm apart from the ordinary world, a gilded bubble that is both cocoon and prison. Some of this is a matter of circumstance. Versailles in “Marie Antoinette,” the Chateau Marmont hotel in “Somewhere,” the Tokyo Hyatt in “Lost in Translation” and suburbia in “The Virgin Suicides” and “The Bling Ring” — all of these are environments designed to quarantine their privileged residents from the disorder and misery of life.But Ms. Coppola also chooses to emphasize this removal, to narrow the perspective of her films by turning her gaze away from certain complications. In the case of “The Beguiled” this means that the war and its causes are banished to the margins. Occasionally a Confederate officer will show up at the gate, and the military situation sometimes arises in conversation, but the conflict is more a premise than a subject. It could be a natural disaster or a zombie-movie epidemic — a background event that provides atmosphere and structure rather than meaning.For this reason, “The Beguiled” has generated some controversy, in particular for omitting all but the most cursory mention of slavery. While this doesn’t strike me as an unfair criticism — as Corey Atad points out in Slate, an onscreen note explaining that “the slaves left” carries understatement to the point of historical irresponsibility — it also risks applying a standard that may not be entirely relevant to Ms. Coppola’s concerns.I say “may not” because her intentions are somewhat opaque. This “Beguiled” (based, like the Siegel-Eastwood version, on Thomas Cullinan’s novel) is a study in moods and implications, picking up difficult, volatile themes and then carefully putting them down again. The earlier film is a bracingly pulpy product of its moment, a time when American movies were breaking free of repressive codes and reveling — sometimes wallowing — in sexual display and rough violence. It’s smutty and disturbing and feverish, rooting around in the muck of the unconscious and the mess of the American past and digging up all kinds of disturbing stuff.None of that applies to Ms. Coppola’s film, which is less interested in battling repression than in observing its mechanisms and arguing, quietly and unmistakably, for its virtues. Her “Beguiled” is less a hothouse flower than a bonsai garden, a work of cool, exquisite artifice that evokes wildness on a small, controlled scale.I have called the film a fairy tale but you could also describe it as a horror movie, a quasi-western and a revenge melodrama, perhaps too many things at once. Most effectively, though — and largely thanks to Ms. Kidman’s regal, witty performance — it’s a comedy, a country-house farce about the problems caused by an inconvenient guest."

The initial images are of a marsh at dawn, populated by some exotic-looking and shy-seeming birds, and of a nest full of eggs.Fernando, the title character, played by Paul Hamy, is camping out in this remote area of northern Portugal; with his binoculars at the ready, he is eager to get some work done. But a phone call with bad reception, in which a friend or relative reminds him to take his meds, vexes him a little. Soon, though, he has bigger troubles, as rapid water sends his kayak off course.The movie cuts to a couple of young Chinese women on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, depicting their adventures so far in a series of smartphone photos. They seem pretty normal. Lost in the woods, they come across a supine and unconscious Fernando. The two women revive him, feed him and later truss him up and suspend him from a tree while he’s asleep. After Fernando awakes and manages to free himself, he spies on them outside of their tent. “Tomorrow, we’ll castrate him,” one exclaims. These women are not so normal after all.Fernando escapes, but other odd encounters await him. He finds the remains of his kayak, placed upright in the middle of what looks like a ritual circle. By night, he witnesses a group of costumed men whooping it up in what appears to be some kind of pagan frat ritual. By the time Fernando encounters a mute shepherd named Jesus, you may have figured out that “The Ornithologist” is an allegory, or something like it. As it happens, it is an irrational, aspirational, surreal retelling of the story of St. Anthony.Mr. Rodrigues is an accomplished director whose best-known films in the United States — “O Fantasma” (2002) and “To Die Like a Man” (2011) — were stylistically distinctive, relatively realistic treatments of queer themes. “The Ornithologist,” while containing imagery that’s influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky and Luis Buñuel, is very much Mr. Rodrigues’s own. His approach to this material occasionally brings homoerotic themes to the forefront, and is very 21st-century in its knowing detachment and occasional mischief. By the same token, though, there are times when he flirts with the ridiculous, and delves into it. Mr. Rodrigues ultimately delivers an intriguing, daring film that is likely to surprise both his fans and moviegoers unfamiliar with his work."

But — surprise — the fifth “Transformers” movie, “The Last Knight,” is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins.What Mr. Hopkins, a knighted Emmy and Oscar winner, is doing in a “Transformers” movie is unclear, but he brings a goofy dignity to the enterprise that elevates this chapter over its recent brethren. The storytelling is also an upgrade. For one thing, we finally are given a believable explanation for the purpose of Stonehenge.Mark Wahlberg, who joined the franchise in the fourth film, the unwatchably long and convoluted “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” is back as the scruffy inventor Cade Yeager.As this story opens, Cade is one of the few humans who still has some affection for Autobots, the robotic immigrants from outer space who mean well but whose war with the Decepticons has resulted in all sorts of havoc on Earth. The rest of humanity is still annoyed with them for wrecking a perfectly good city, Chicago, earlier in the franchise.Autobots and Decepticons transform into motor vehicles and other things, a special-effects sight that apparently never grows old for fans of the series. And they have what seems like an ever-changing back story. The one conjured here involves Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin and the Dark Ages, which is where Mr. Hopkins’s character, Edmund Burton, comes in.He’s a sort of keeper of the Arthurian/Transformers legend, and he knows that a long-forecast climactic battle is coming for control of Merlin’s staff, an ancient relic that has formidable powers when wielded by the right person.In this case that person is Viviane (Laura Haddock), a British scholar who is skeptical of the Round Table tales and is also just the right age to be a potential romantic interest for Cade. As for Stonehenge, well, without giving away too much, let’s just say that invaders from space are coming to suck the life out of our planet, and the great monument is not merely the clunkiest calendar ever made.Also in the mix are Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the military man from the previous movies; Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael), Cade’s jokey sidekick; and Izabella (Isabela Moner), the obligatory cute kid. The best touch, though, is Cogman (the voice of Jim Carter), Edmund’s robotic butler, a sort of C-3PO with a temper (as a robot who aims a C-3PO joke at him finds out).This movie series can only wish it had the depth and coherence of the “Star Wars” franchise, but the homage is nice, and Cogman and Edmund have some witty moments, something the more plodding sequels lacked.Michael Bay again directs, and he and his writers (Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan are credited with the screenplay, and those three along with Akiva Goldsman with the story) put more humanity and less clanking into this installment. Mr. Bay seems to rein in his tendency for high-speed pursuits and robotic clashes somewhat, and he varies the vroom-vroom car-chase stuff by throwing in a submarine chase.But don’t worry; if for some reason the drawn-out and incoherent battle scenes are what you liked about the earlier films, the climactic one here is still both of those things. The movie is shorter (by about 15 minutes) than the last one, though, and considerably more bearable."

There’s a lot to get past, including an opener that engages in some generic place-setting, and a pushy score that insistently tries to lighten the darker moods. But stick with the movie for its leads, Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke, a beautifully matched pair who open up two closed people, unleashing torrents of feeling.Ms. Hawkins plays Maud Lewis, who, when the story starts, is in her early 30s and struggling to maintain a fragile independence. She’s living with her Aunt Ida (Gabrielle Rose), a dour scold whose opprobrium has seeped into every corner of her house and who enters, haggling with a man who proves to be Maud’s brother, Charles (Zachary Bennett). He has sold the family home, and is dumping Maud at Aunt Ida’s for the foreseeable future. Maud pleads and protests, and then moodily waits for her story to begin.It gets going when Maud does, too. One day at the grocery store, she is nearly knocked over by a hard, loud wind that blows in and in time becomes her unlikely husband, Everett Lewis (Mr. Hawke). A reclusive fish peddler — much of the story takes place on the outskirts of a Nova Scotia town — he lives in a tiny white wooden house on a spit of land with only a couple of dogs and a flock of chickens for company. Having decided that he needs a housekeeper, he posts an ad in the store that Maud surreptitiously steals. She has figured a way out of Aunt Ida’s dominion and straight into a new life.That life emerges with pinprick detail, framed by windswept landscapes and the bright flowers and birds that Maud begins painting, painful stroke by stroke, on the shack’s walls, steps, pots and windows, vivid manifestations of her will to create. Mostly, it is a life that emerges through the contrapuntal performances of Ms. Hawkins and Mr. Hawke, who, with bobbing heads, mutter and murmur, bringing you into the private world of two outsiders isolated by geography, poverty, disability, temperament and habit. It’s easy, especially, to admire Ms. Hawkins’s technical skill — the private smiles and halting, crooked walk — but the beauty of her performance is that soon you see only Maud.Directed by Aisling Walsh, with a script by Sherry White, “Maudie” is based — or perhaps, more truly, inspired — by the life of Maud Lewis (1903-1970). A self-taught artist who lived in extreme poverty much of her adult life, Lewis struggled with what appears to have been juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, painting bold, colorful scenes of red trees and black cats with brushes tucked in a tiny, gnarled hand. If you didn’t know her name, you might not know that she was real. The story’s historical basis isn’t announced; there are none of the usual biopic introductions, no text to set the time and place, only some brief, closing documentary images that suggest that the movie has gently prettified the truth.The film doesn’t cop to that, which doesn’t lessen its appeal. The distancing from the real Lewis registers as a commercial calculation, as does the emphasis on Maud and Everett’s relationship, which here evolves into an achingly moving love story. How much of it is true, including that love’s depths, remains unclear; certainly the movie deviates sharply in sweep and detail from some accounts, most notably Lance Woolaver’s biography “Maud Lewis: The Heart on the Door.” Mr. Woolaver has called Lewis’s life desperate and her husband terrible, and wrote a book that, as he told one interviewer, deflates the myth of her “as a happy little elf in a bright house doing nothing but paint.”Like many screen biographies, “Maudie” vacillates unsteadily between the brute realities of a difficult existence and its palatable imagery. The movie doesn’t erase the hard edges of Lewis’s life. Instead, it attenuates them — a brutal slap across the face, you suspect, stands in for more instances of physical abuse — and casts many of Maud and Everett’s difficulties as personal ordeals, playing down the institutional forces, like an orphanage, that discreetly hover in the background. There’s an argument to be made against such softening, though, as Lewis’s work suggests, there’s something necessary about the fantasies we make of our lives as we spin beauty and hope from despair."

These are classics of the so-called Neo-Realist movement that include “Shoeshine,” “Bicycle Thieves” and “Umberto D.” Careers in film often take unusual turns. My film students teared up at “Bicycle Thieves” and then were both puzzled and amused when I showed them the opening of “After the Fox,” an elaborately silly 1966 caper comedy starring Peter Sellers that seems worlds away from “Thieves” but was also, as it happens, directed by De Sica.The circumstances under which De Sica made “After the Fox” are too complex to get into here. But as deftly demonstrated by “Il Boom,” a 1963 film he made that is only now getting a United States release, courtesy of Rialto Pictures and Film Forum, comedy was always a part of this director’s skill set. Written by Cesare Zavattini, who did the screenplays for many of De Sica’s best-known works, the movie skewers the mendacity inherent in the postwar economic resurgence in his country.Alberto Sordi plays Giovanni, a building contractor with big ideas and a lavish lifestyle that’s mostly enjoyed by his wife, Silvia (Gianna Maria Canale), with whom he is quite properly besotted. But the movie begins with our hero in a bit of a spot, owing a large sum of money he can’t pay. So convincing is his masquerade of affluence that when he asks a rich tennis partner for a loan, the other man assumes that Giovanni is joking. An appeal to his boss ends when that boss falls asleep in the middle of his pitch. During a heart-to-heart with the wife of a megarich industrialist, she makes him a proposition. “What I’m about to ask may surprise you: Would you sell an eye?”Sordi’s 10-second reaction to the question is worth the price of admission. His characterization of Giovanni, who’s vulnerable, sometimes dim, ever teetering on the brink of showing his full desperation, is arguably the film’s strongest selling point. (This stretch was good for Sordi; he also had a fantastic turn then as a reluctant hit man in the comedy “Mafioso.”)Not that De Sica’s directorial signature is absent. His portrait of a different aspect of the Italian early ’60s “dolce vita,” in which the entrepreneurial middle class rubs elbows with, and tries to wheel and deal with, the obscenely wealthy, is packed with trenchant observation and mordant wit."

Matt Schrader’s tidy and informative “Score” lavishes similar adoration on moviedom’s great composers. And why not? Their contribution can be as substantial as that of cinematographers, or even actors, though more subtle — but not always.Example No. 1: Bill Conti’s theme to “Rocky,” as brash and manipulative an accompaniment to a workout montage as ever there was. From there, the movie recounts the early days of Wurlitzer organs and musicians improvising to silent movies for live audiences, before segueing into a brief, basic lesson in director-composer collaborations.The greats are here, either discussed or appearing on camera themselves: Max Steiner (whose orchestral flourishes enriched “King Kong”); Alex North (of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” whom the film credits with ushering jazz into scores); John Barry (whose James Bond theme would influence spy films in perpetuity); and giants on their own mountaintop, Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone. (What, no Elmer Bernstein or Erich Wolfgang Korngold? But why quibble?) More recent innovators, like Trent Reznor (“The Social Network”), Danny Elfman (Tim Burton’s “Batman”) and Rachel Portman (“Race”), speak eloquently. John Williams (“Jaws,” “Star Wars”) casts a very long shadow.Inordinate time is spent with Hans Zimmer, whose symphonic-synthesizer scores define the current action-spectacle template. But he rightly says film composers are “one of the last people on earth” who regularly employ orchestra musicians. “Without us,” he adds, “the orchestra might disappear,” which would be “such a loss to humanity.” And who can argue?"

Yet the atmosphere of dread that Mr. Fukada tends with such ruthless precision — and more than a little sadism — depends not on creepy camera moves or other visual trickery. Instead, this chilly tale of violent secrets and unvoiced misery relies heavily on the skill of actors who seem to know that one false move could tip the whole enterprise into comedy.Even before the arrival of the mysterious Mr. Yasaka (Tadanobu Asano), the marriage of Toshio (Kanji Furutachi), the owner of a small machine shop, and his self-effacing wife, Akie (Mariko Tsutsui), appears passionless. Polite but distant, they share meals and the care of their small daughter, Hotaru, with so little intimacy that when Toshio offers Yasaka a room and a job, he doesn’t even ask his wife’s opinion. All too soon, though, he’ll have cause to regret his impulsiveness.A companion piece to Mr. Fukada’s 2010 comedy, “Hospitalité,” “Harmonium” binds not one but two broken families in a clammy union of tragedy and seduction. As Yasaka’s presence in the household becomes ever more disruptive, the story veers in unexpected directions, leaping over years before landing with wrenching ambiguity. Yet the implacable pacing and Kenichi Negishi’s unruffled cinematography shape Yasaka into a near-mythic instrument of destruction. His motives are murky for a reason: By committing the character to nothing, Mr. Fukada allows us to suspect him of everything."

Viewers are also reminded that Shakur was only 25 when he died in September 1996 after being fatally injured in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. His killing has never been solved.From the opening, Mr. Boom’s direction is uniformly uninspired: A reporter’s prison interview with Shakur frames the movie’s first half, and Mr. Boom blocks and shoots his scenes with dismal stolidness. Few sequences last longer than a couple of minutes; the movie plods along with a “and then this happened” dutifulness, occasionally cutting back to the prison interview to have the reporter ask a pointed question or two. This almost invariably allows the film to excuse Shakur for bad actions that the reporter brings up during the interview. (Speaking of which, the movie is genuinely distasteful in its casual misogyny when depicting the sexual abuse case for which Shakur was convicted in 1994.)Mr. Boom has genuinely good reason to chronicle Shakur’s eventful life even before his birth. Shakur’s mother, Afeni, who died last year, was a civil rights activist and a Black Panther; an early scene shows her emerging victorious from a conspiracy trial a month before giving birth to him.But the intriguing, politically minded people he grew up among, as well as those he later made music and did business with, are portrayed in conventional, clichéd ways. “I’d rather die on my feet than live on my knees,” Shakur’s stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, proclaims at a meeting of a black community group.“Your stepdaddy is a revolutionary,” Afeni, played by Danai Gurira, tells the young Tupac. “I’m gonna be a revolutionary,” he replies.Almost all the dialogue is that flat-footed. (Jeremy Haft, Eddie Gonzalez and Steven Bagatourian wrote the script.) It’s a stark contrast to the almost always vivid power of Shakur’s own words, which could be profoundly empathetic and pettily profane. Not enough of them are heard here, but when Mr. Shipp has some of them at his disposal, or is given enough space in a scene to maneuver into an actual characterization, he is very impressive. This movie fails his considerable talents; I hope that he is soon afforded a better vehicle for them."

It was directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Gregg Hurwitz, and I suggest you skip it or catch it on streaming or on the back of an airplane seat, where presumably it will soon be playing. You may like a few things, especially Jaeden Lieberher, who plays Henry with real feeling and deserves a long career. But you may wonder how long Jacob Tremblay, who was so good in “Room,” will be cast for his tremulousness. And you may also, after stifling your yawns, hope that the next time you see Naomi Watts it’s in a movie that plays to her strengths and doesn’t treat her or the audience so contemptuously."

But the most insightful scene comes in the middle of this documentary, when the New York Warriors of the National Gay Flag Football League take on a straight team from Long Island.The Long Island players aren’t told that most of the Warriors are gay, and excerpts shown from the game — no spoilers on the winner — feature some intense competition. After one Long Islander learns of the opposing players’ sexuality, he reacts with a shrug and with praise for their skills.That’s how you want life to be: people judged on their abilities and without foolish preconceptions. And if we’re not there yet, this likable film at least offers several optimistic moments as Seth Greenleaf, the director, follows the Warriors, the L.A. Motion and other teams as they train for the yearly Gay Bowl flag football tournament. (The game, a variation on touch football, places a premium on speed; players are downed not by tackles, but when an opponent pulls a marker from the ball carrier’s belt.)Along the way, we listen to coming-out stories and look into the conflict between traditional views of masculinity, especially in sports (and in the N.F.L. in particular), and stereotypes of homosexuality. It’s an interesting mix, though a few of the interviews meander, and, except for the championship, there’s little sense of urgency onscreen.The film gains momentum, however, as the athletes experience hope, disappointment, pain and joy during the final contest. It should go without saying, but Mr. Greenleaf knows it’s worth showing: On the field and off, we are all so much alike."

Captured by Mark Silk’s darting camera, and in water so clouded that the computer-generated predators more than pass visual muster, their misadventures are casually entertaining.Less so are the movie’s slapdash setup and paper-thin characterizations. Lisa (the appealing Mandy Moore), is a recent dumpee who’s eager to prove to her ex that she’s not nearly as boring as he believes. Her younger sister, Kate (Claire Holt), is merely the free spirit who goads Lisa into the water. Above them, an improbably cast Matthew Modine plays the captain of a boat so sketchy looking that it’s a wonder any of his passengers make it back to shore.Shot in gigantic water tanks outside London and in the Dominican Republic, “47 Meters Down” — despite a clever final section — struggles to extract tension from clamor and agitation. Mr. Roberts should have studied Chris Kentis’s 2004 frightener, “Open Water,” which coaxed throat-closing dread from little more than a silent horizon and a diver’s legs waving below the surface like fronds of seaweed. Sometimes it’s scarier when no one can hear you scream."

Certainly the journey of Rachel Flowers, a blind musician and composer, is impressive, but “Hearing Is Believing,” a documentary about her, doesn’t put enough effort into giving her tale depth and context.Ms. Flowers, now 23, was born 15 weeks premature, and among the complications was the loss of her eyesight. Yet, as a toddler, she demonstrated profound musical ability, and she was soon adept on keyboards, flute and other instruments. A measure of YouTube fame followed.The film, by Lorenzo DeStefano, chronicles her musical development, but haphazardly, sometimes seeming more promotional than exploratory. We learn only a little about Ms. Flowers’s creative process and the difficulties she and her family faced over the years.The film also doesn’t make much effort to put her achievements in historical context. A number of skilled musicians, some of them household names, have been blind or faced other physical challenges. Despite a cameo by Stevie Wonder, that goes largely unacknowledged. It would have been nice at least to hear Ms. Flowers’s thoughts on where she fits in this chain of rare talents. More outside assessments of her music also would have been welcome.After an aimless hour, the film eventually gets some traction with a segment in which Dweezil Zappa brings Ms. Flowers onstage during one of his concerts to perform works by his father, Frank Zappa. It’s the climax of this film, but really Ms. Flowers’s career is just beginning. There might be a better documentary to be made about her some years in the future."

Ian Paisley, who spearheaded the Democratic Unionist Party (he died in 2014), and Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein leader (who died in March).The film begins in October 2006, at St. Andrews in Scotland, where Britain, the Irish Republic and Northern Irish parties — including the Democratic Unionist Party (the D.U.P.) and Sinn Fein — are negotiating what was called the St. Andrews Agreement, a power-sharing pact between Unionists and Irish republicans. The conceit is that the aging Paisley (Timothy Spall), who has a 50th wedding anniversary to attend in Belfast, and McGuinness (Colm Meaney) share a ride to the airport to ensure that neither is subject to an assassination attempt.Driven by a fresh-faced chauffeur (Freddie Highmore), the two are secretly monitored via hidden surveillance cameras by the British prime minister, Tony Blair (Toby Stephens); the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern (Mark Lambert); a British government operative (John Hurt); and, eventually, McGuinness’s Sinn Fein compatriot Gerry Adams (Ian Beattie). After a minor car accident, Paisley and McGuinness walk to an empty church and cemetery where, among other things, they discuss the Bloody Sunday shootings in Londonderry in 1972 and the I.R.A. bombing in Enniskillen in 1987. Though the script tilts to the didactic, the performances are absolutely delicious, with Mr. Meaney droll and understated and Mr. Spall fiery and derisive, yet not above a joke.The film suggests that all became harmonious between the two, and, implicitly, their parties. In real life, the D.U.P. is now propping up Theresa May’s government in Britain, while Sinn Fein has gained voting power and seems to be biding its time for Ireland’s reunification. (Scotland, meanwhile, is pondering another independence referendum.) “I play a long game,” Mr. Meaney’s McGuinness says. “We are Ireland. We are inevitable.”"

And that’s exactly how disconnected he sounds when playing Will Porter, a scientist-pilot hired by a shady corporation to intervene when an experiment goes catastrophically awry.The plot, unlike its execution, is not terrible. A parallel universe has been created as a new source of energy for our depleted world, but something screwy has happened and Will must hop over there to assess the situation. When he arrives, he encounters malignant drones and armed militants — none of whom are on board with his plan to destroy the new world to save the old one.Visually, this translates to a video-game-style slog from Will’s crash site to a tower where the titular switch will be flicked. Back home, a widowed sister and sick nephew — trying gamely to humanize a paper-thin lead character — stare at the sky and wonder why Uncle Will is never around long enough to tell them anything.The audience won’t learn much about this so-called echo world either, except that its signs — much like the name of the movie’s novice director, Tim Smit — read backward.“I don’t feel like I’ve done a very good job,” Will says when his mission is over. True that."

If their fourth feature (their first three, including “L’Iceberg” and “The Fairy,” were directed with Bruno Romy) is mild by design, their style — equal parts Jacques Tati, Jerry Lewis, Wes Anderson and “Wallace & Gromit” — isn’t easy to pull off.“Lost in Paris” begins in a snowy Canadian outpost, where Fiona (Ms. Gordon) receives a letter from Martha (Emmanuelle Riva, of “Amour,” who died in January), an aunt who left for Paris decades earlier. Martha is 88 and a bit daffy. (She’s shown putting the letter in the trash instead of a mailbox in a Mr. Magoo-style mishap. It’s later rescued.)Fiona decides to pay Martha a visit, bringing luggage more suited to mountaineering than a Parisian getaway. The luggage eventually makes its way to Dom (Mr. Abel), a hobo who is dashing enough to charm Fiona at a riverboat restaurant.Most of the pleasures of “Lost in Paris” come from watching the coincidences multiply as Fiona, Dom and Martha narrowly miss one another. There is a case of mistaken identity at a funeral and a bit of acrobatic derring-do on the Eiffel Tower. In one sweet interlude, Ms. Riva and Pierre Richard (playing Martha’s former lover) perform dance steps while seated on a bench, accentuated by close-ups of the pair’s shoes.“Lost in Paris” grows a bit tiresome at feature length, but it’s a winning divertissement."
