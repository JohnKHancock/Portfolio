The Immediate Impact of Integration on MLB -- A Data Analysis
Prior to 1947, Major League Baseball had a “gentlemen’s agreement”, wherein owners
agreed to segregate the game based on the race of the players. In 1947, the Brooklyn Dodgers
and the Cleveland Indians broke that agreement when they fielded two African American
players, Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby. These moves ushered in integration into major league
baseball. From 1947 onward, the game would no longer be restricted based on race. Ending
discrimination meant that MLB would become a true representation of the best players in the
world. However, not every team embraced integration early on like the Dodgers and the Indians.
It would take 12 years after Jackie Robinson for every team to be integrated with at least one
African American player.
