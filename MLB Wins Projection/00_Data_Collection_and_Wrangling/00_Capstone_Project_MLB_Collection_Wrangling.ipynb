For example, the strikeouts metric, \"SO\", is the same for both hitting and pitching, but it has two very different meanings.  In order to distinguish these features, I had to prepend an identifier.  For fielding, I prepended, \"FIELD_\". For pitching, I used \"PITCH_\", and for hitting, I used \"HIT_\". \n",

First, we need to know the percentage of missing data for each feature. The graphic below shows those features which have greater than 20% NaN values. This makes intuitive sense that the Fielding features would have the higher NaN counts since it's difficult to measure fielding statistics unless it is being observed in real time. Pitching and hitting statistics can be gleaned from the box score."

    "In this section, I have described the source of the dataset, detailed the collection process, inspected the data, and performed data wrangling in order to prepare the final dataset.  I made some major choices about the data.  First, I culled the data by removing features that are more player oriented than team oriented. Next, I cleaned up data that had the '%' sign.  Finally, I removed all features that had NaN values. Some, or even all, of the choices that I made may affect the model's performance. However, given the steps laid out in this section, it should be fairly simple to reverse or add another step which will lead to a different final data set.  Additionally, I saved off the datasets after every step.  Each of these save datasets could be substituted in the next section, building the model. "
