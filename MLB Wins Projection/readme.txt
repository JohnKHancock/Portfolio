This project is divided into two parts. Part one in the folder, 00_Data_Collection_and_Wrangling, contains the iPython Notebook and supporting files which documents the process of collecting, cleaning, and wrangling the data.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS NOTEBOOK POPULATES THE FOLDER, "00_Data_Collection_and_Wrangling\Data\Revised Statistics\Years\Output\" WITH csv FILES.  CURRENTLY THE FOLDER IS EMPTY, THE NOTEBOOK WILL POPULATE IT.  IF YOU RUN THE NOTEBOOK AGAIN, YOU MUST REMOVE ALL OF THE FILES FROM THE OUTPUT FOLDER.


Part two, in the folder, 01_The Model, contains the iPython Notebook and supporting files which documents the process of pre-processing the data, building the models, and analysis of the results.
